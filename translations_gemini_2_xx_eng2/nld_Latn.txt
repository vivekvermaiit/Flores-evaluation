The United States Olympic Committee has the support of USA Gymnastics and understands that it is necessary for the Olympic family to promote a safe place for all athletes.
We align ourselves with the USOC's statement that it is best for our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to implement meaningful changes within our organization rather than withdraw certifications.

This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, this animal's plumage was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do possess other feather characteristics, such as barbs.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but to regulate temperature or for appearance. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but this specimen shows mature feathers and therefore is not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite it being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

The annoyances within the community resulted in the current efforts to establish a policy regarding sexual content on the site, which hosts millions of pieces of openly licensed media content.
The completed work was primarily theoretical in nature, but the program is written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was searching for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts force on the Earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around it, in a kind of ring, and consists of a large amount of smaller particles.

What is consistent is that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally required hardly any technology: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope indicating which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the voter's identity. Then, the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box, and then signs the voter register.
The process is relatively tightly regulated in the electoral law of France.
Ballot boxes must be transparent since 1988, so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

In the other competition she participated in, the sitting Giant Slalom, she came tenth among the women, with a combined time of 4:41:30. That is 2:11:60 minutes slower than the Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's group for the sitting slalom were unable to complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been recovered by the police of Madhya Pradesh.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the rapists of the Swedish woman have been arrested, and they have found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit it, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver did sustain serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to Great Yarmouth, at the James Paget Hospital.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the eyewitness account may have been compromised due to the extensive publicity of her story.
This is standard practice in the rest of the UK, but the justice system in Scotland works differently, and courts have deemed the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office has overall responsibility for prosecutions and has indicated to journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges have been brought.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute resolution, something the Palestinians were keen on based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, a city holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement. However, the PA is only willing to allow a presence of five years.
Marksmen in the supplementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest rangers because the trial was being followed and its effectiveness was being assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation have received extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a nine-member new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
With this, Martelly has obtained a CEP five times in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous National Electoral Council. This is part of a package of measures to allow for new elections in the country.
The commission was established by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose due to the postponement of elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases have been reported of defective iPods overheating. In total, this led to six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
"Deeply regrettable," was the ministry's reaction to the fact that Apple has postponed the report.
Mariana was struck by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Disaster Management stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
Additionally, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning in effect.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former Philippine policeman hijacked a bus and took tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been brought to safety, and at least six fatalities have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins went into medicine, following in his father's footsteps.
Trained as a midwife, he started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, Liggins researched premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that the maturation of fetal lungs in babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government researchers found two 'black boxes' with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels stated that 'Luna was just as weird as I am... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place'.
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in this poll supported this viewpoint. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29 percent of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while at the other end, 31 percent said that should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to alleviate his pain, because it was banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest currently known prime number on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source through which water came to Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into how planets are formed. They are particularly interested in knowing how the Earth was formed, considering that it has been a long time since comets collided with the Earth.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the gossip 'political nonsense and drivel'.
There is speculation that he wants to run for president in 2016.
With the NextGen system, the FAA believes that aircraft could take shorter routes, potentially saving millions of tons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technologies with ground-based radar, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and provide pilots with clearer information.
No extra transport will be provided, and no overground trains will stop at Wembley; in addition, the parking lots and the Park & Ride will not be accessible on site.
A potential lack of transport increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science discussed the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossbreeding of a native Darwin's finch, the Medium ground finch, with an immigrant Cactus ground finch, the Española ground finch, took longer.
Gold can be worked into many shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into sheets.
After it has been made very thin, it can be glued onto another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You are already making an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Subsequently, the color of the cabbage juice changes based on the acidity (acidic to basic or alkaline) of the chemical substance.
The pH value is indicated based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance that has been tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands, and form a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a sort of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Sewage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, toilets already existed in China, Egypt, and Persia in antiquity. For example, toilets in the Roman era were often part of a public bathhouse, where both ladies and gentlemen gathered together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is immediately sent back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and images.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space, you need a massive rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are medium-sized felines among them that eat medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
Furthermore, there are many small cats (such as free-roaming cats kept as pets) that hunt large numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has so they don't compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves almost the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats), and which are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances, and has five times the pulling power of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar with full force like a lion. It's more like he's growling a whole sentence.
The ocelot's favorite meal is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively animals that are much smaller than itself.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey), by smelling the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to night vision and move very discreetly. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the large population from which they originated (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island from which they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different resources and different enemies are present, so the new population must adopt a different approach or adapt to compete.
Because they still require the same adaptations as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to resemble the other population less and less.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and simply involves the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Through photosynthesis, plants obtain their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made from plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at that time. It had nothing to fear from anyone, except from other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws held more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning nothing and no one could escape him.
It's not certain, but it's possible its tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even its own kind.
In bodies of water, nothing was safe from its attacks; even gigantic dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
In addition, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men preferred to hold a banquet together where they would lounge on their sides while eating.
Meals from Roman antiquity did not include any food that was introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa. Furthermore, no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods. This temple was seen as the god's own home.
Sacrifices were made to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a public courtyard and a back chamber accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers in the shape of pyramids were built, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family mostly took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, and therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants at that time. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his way west, and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal families, customs, and histories of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, and Norway differed greatly from one another.
Perhaps after the movie National Treasure, you think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is based on a misunderstanding, however. There is something written on the back, but it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) used to be rolled up for storage.
So it seems that the designation was simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was governed by Vichy France. These were French people who sided with the Germans in 1940 and thus collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France in just two weeks. After that, they set out for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who collectively live and work in a society.
From the Latin civilis, meaning civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which stands for citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that also defines, in a certain way, the format of society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down through multiple generations, leaving a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave behind no relevant historical evidence. As a result, they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
The congress lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judiciary and it relied on state authorities to implement all decisions, who were often unwilling to cooperate.
It also did not have the authority to override tax laws and rates between states.
First, all states had to unanimously agree to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government very seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team worldwide, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest). This makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often geographically referred to as a 'peninsula'.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed past the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC (United East India Company) established itself in southwestern Taiwan as a base of operations, where the VOC addressed the indigenous grain production processes and put Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
Following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Composed of three main structures, Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better idea of what they looked like before.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. The renovation is still ongoing.
For example, worldwide the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the standard film format in the aftermath of the analog film era.
These are still being produced to this day, although it is mainly the aspect ratio that the image sensor of the digital camera adopted.
Oddly enough, 35mm film is actually 36mm wide, with a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) would then be 3:2.
Many common layouts (for example, APS-like layouts) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also clear.
The most effective spot for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. You divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under fire.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has connected European states, despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervasive power influenced everyone.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and for this reason, the church has financial resources at its disposal.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to doubt whether this principle was being adhered to.
Great Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to supply vital provisions to soldiers and civilians. However, this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been established in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain placed mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer sail in entire sections of the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolationism.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he only had 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) for Thomas Edison with him.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinct dynasty.
Also between the different dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The best known was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During that time, fierce wars took place between various nobles who fought for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is known as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the notion that the country belongs to its inhabitants instead of a single leader.
After the revolution, positions were available for all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and suitable candidates to succeed.
The same goes for the army. Army ranks are no longer based on someone's class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
Muhammad was intensely occupied with otherworldly matters. He often went to a cave for contemplation, which later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mount of Light.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, provides a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountaintops on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not at all easy to find. Once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
All that can be seen are the bright, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built in the third century BC by the Egyptians and is one of the countless great pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or 'Giza pyramids', in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous small tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built as tributes to Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-bow sign looks like a V, and the down-bow sign looks like a staple or a square with the bottom missing.
Up bow means that you start at the tip and push the bow away. Down bow means that you start at the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement creates a stronger and more assertive sound.
Feel free to sketch your own personal touches, but don't forget that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they usually need to be respected.
A group of market women were behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They rode back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jeering and threatening mobs who were threatening the Royal couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles before the eyes of a terrified queen.
The costs of the U.S. imperialism's war regarding the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were required by the American colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large portion of the costs, and interest on bonds was issued through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism was largely based on the enormous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that triggered the order's formation.
The period in which this occurred is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the Early Middle Ages came the High Middle Ages. These were in turn followed by the Late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology offering or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some might say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for only a few cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the road, and this leads to the development of new techniques in the field of healthcare to be able to repair the human body.
Romanticism incorporated a significant element of cultural determinism, which originated from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the Romantic era, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures arose as a result of this geography. These formed a harmonious society and were better than arbitrary imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from around 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic architecture flourished in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture from the East.
However, styles in the west lagged behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a distinct style began to develop in Western Europe. One of the biggest developments was the result of the Crusades: people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture in which enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses saved seed from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture. In many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves through the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of one or more of these factors.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a specific symbolic style in what they wear, how they behave, and the jargon they speak.
One of the most frequently used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization was the few regrettable cases of children who, due to neglect, adversity, or willful abuse during their upbringing, were not socialized by adults.
They are called 'feral children' or 'wild children'. Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Unmanageable children may have experienced severe child abuse or a serious trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some are claimed to have been raised by animals, and others are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behaviors similar to those of the animal that cared for them (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals facing a new learning experience, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the paperclip assistant from Microsoft Office.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software, which asks questions, offers memory aids, and explains procedures that students might find difficult to understand without help.
There are various reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where no one cares about them, and where they cannot develop, but this still happens.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
The intention of foster care is to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
Online, elements of interpersonal and mass communication are merged.
The diverse characteristics of the internet lead to new dimensions regarding the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
'Learning' and 'socialization' are, for example, presented as important reasons to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It is specifically stated that no one can detect a lie by solely focusing on micro-expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks described how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also possess the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has revealed that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variation; selection eliminates this variation from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, variation between the two groups is introduced through segregation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans would have difficulty obtaining the necessary amino acids from the plant-based resources found on the savanna.
Furthermore, failure to take it into account can have serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately even death.
The easiest plant-based sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a very high amount of protein, including all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna solve this problem today.
Sleep disruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall back asleep within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy to do by using a relatively gentle alarm that brings you back to consciousness without immediately waking you up completely.
If you turn off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way, you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the circadian rhythm include drinking plenty of fluids before going to sleep (especially water or tea, a known diuretic). This will mean you have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of stress they carry in their body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Every person is capable of achieving contentment and total peace.
Everyone can enlighten their mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the emulation of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, a collaboration between the USSR and the US came about. When the war came to an end, the conflicts between system, process, and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies stood directly opposed to each other two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years, with proxy wars fought on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense forces held out only until September 17, 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were outdated in a single night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after occupying the eastern parts of Poland. This was in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international peace treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the navy's task to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
The US tried to get troops and supplies to the British across the Atlantic, and this North Atlantic campaign of WWII is one of the most remarkable recent examples of this.
The German navy simultaneously tried to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Great Britain would likely have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It is believed that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
In antiquity, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily obtain their hair, meat, milk, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then guarded by goat herders, often a child or young person, just like the more familiar shepherd. Today, herding is still done in the same way.
Horse-drawn railways were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Although horse-drawn railways consisted only of a track made of planks, the horses had to run faster and pull larger quantities than on the somewhat difficult to navigate roads of that time.
Crossbeams were used fairly early on to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on top.
This quickly became common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear and tear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden ones. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were laid.
The first form of transportation we know is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus emerged (that means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
Bipedal specializations are found in fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago. Incidentally, Sahelanthropus may have also walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement, or even engage in activism to alleviate future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it's much like a symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the root cause of the problems and eliminate them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have clearly and profoundly changed the Earth. Moreover, overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away. This draft was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th and read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that a type of dinosaur still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still bring dinosaurs to mind.
They have claws and scales on their legs, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language, 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made right away.
The presence of open boxes of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
This insect group is formally called 'true bugs' by entomologists.
This term originates from an age-old agreement with bedbugs, which are insects that are very good at parasitizing humans.
Both red pirate bugs and bed bugs are nest-bound, meaning they have adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the US, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. This includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the primary goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
Yet, it's about more than just experiments; an experiment is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to question them, and to make observations, serving as a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not simply reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle for a specific period of time, even if no external signals are given.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted. In one experiment, the DNA in the phage was labeled with radioactive phosphorus, and in the other experiment, the protein of the phage was labeled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or cancer to develop.
Nature tourism attracts people who enjoy visiting natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On the spot, one can, among other things, hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks, and study the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small villages drive to their workplaces and pass people whose workplaces are located in the village they just left.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in some way connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science indicates that due to this enormous carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in the stable state that allowed human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges rarely occur in comparison.
How is it that so many complaints arise with transport systems, why does it go wrong daily? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
A traffic flow considers the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictably. This means that traffic flows exhibit some degree of consistency, and that something can be said about it mathematically.
Connections have been made between the three core characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure are facilitated with the help of these relationships.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could escape enemies more easily and find food and mating partners more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to hide from predators in a greater number of small places.
Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were indeed people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, and therefore the Sun as well (and other stars).
This sounds reasonably logical, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second-longest river, transporting more than 8 times as much water as the second-largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth and in some places has a width of six miles.
At least 20% of all the water that flows into the sea via rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. Its water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already more than a thousand years old at that time.
Approximately 800 people live in Vatican City. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the official language for official communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is used extensively during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is relatively easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This looked more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are, simply put, a combination of at least two metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are classified as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms can fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, the pen has diminished in status as newer writing methods have emerged and is now used much less.
Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You might wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes onto the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it costs energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. When the nucleus is split again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, meaning they fall apart at the slightest disturbance.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outermost layer of the moon.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There are likely more maars on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could reach the surface more easily there.
Content theories aim to identify what motivates people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature.
With these theories, they aim to investigate the reasons why certain people desire certain things and which environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene theory.
Generally, two approaches emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One approach involves trying to act as an equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and take disciplinary measures, conduct performance reviews, delegate, and hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, this person transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she feels the need to change everything the team has done so far and wants to make everything their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, although there are minor differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Often, they are more independent than traditional team members. This is because their teams may have meetings across different time zones, which their local management might not understand.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to embark on the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity come to light when all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organization.
The result of this is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation within an organization, management must foster a culture that prioritizes innovating, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data offers physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, allowing the research area to be narrowed and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists during their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds, and tumors can influence behavior and lead to changes in mental capacity.
Due to the increasing number of new technologies, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately makes most people think of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior falls under AI research.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Nowadays, this artificial intelligence system is frequently used in economic, medical, technical, and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many field trips are planned for each class. Often, a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Thanks to technological advancements, virtual excursions are now possible. This allows students to view artifacts in a museum, peek inside an aquarium, or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year and earlier versions of which are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students write better. Often their grammar and spelling are poor at first, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing and thus avoid criticism.
"Through blogging, students are also compelled to learn more about the world around them." The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can 'help students develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in discussion on the internet, students can find their own place in the context of others' material and simultaneously determine their own position on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and future.
Further south you'll find Niagara Falls. To the north, you'll find the beautiful, unspoiled Muskoka region and much more.
Things like this make Ontario seem typically Canadian to outsiders.
Further north, large areas are sparsely populated, and some of these areas are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in terms of fauna, it is almost a separate continent.
The majority of the smaller islands consist of independent countries or are connected to France, and they are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India, marking the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west, and the Sahel region to the north.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether or not that is true.
It also helps to wear rings (not too expensive-looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behavior they perceive as intimidating and that it is customary to be followed, touched on the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not excuse this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the harbor and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they abandoned the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other trinkets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano spewed lava, burying most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside Goma you should check the status of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
In addition, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you can find some of the most affordable trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa there.
You can get around Goma by boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi). The typical (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Timbuktu is relatively difficult to access and is therefore now used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to desert storms.
It was one of the key stops on the PBS exhibition "Henry Louis Gates' Special Wonders From the African World".
The city differs from the other cities in the country because it has a more Arabic appearance than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, the border with Zimbabwe in the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild animal species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and entrance fees apply.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card. These offer either access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which many tourists consider the most important place.
The vast number of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar graph visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's population lives in close proximity to each other on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into India and Bangladesh.
The Sundarbans are now officially included on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps — they also possess some of the last remaining mighty stretches of jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is peat and swamp area.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and the area is now estimated to contain 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most departures are between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM, especially in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It's wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as the regional buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust, are used.
Shared taxis offer a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction of the bridge was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. The Brazilian customs posts are then expected to be ready for use.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
In the province of Chaco lived other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly also known as 'the great province of the Indies', originated in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
There followed a three-century long period of colonization under the Spanish.
Asunción was founded in 1537, and since then, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions are also held here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information on tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). Its value is approximately equal to one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, there is only one bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store. Here you can exchange money.
Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars as well.
On the remote islands, you probably can't pay with a credit card, but probably can with British and American currency. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Exchange your money back before you leave the islands, as Falkland Islands currency is very difficult to exchange elsewhere.
Montevideo is located below the equator, so when it's summer there, it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. During the summer months, temperatures can easily exceed +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never drops below freezing, but the wind in combination with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains approximately the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' seasons.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are still ultimately wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep a distance of at least 100 meters from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals, in the park.
Moose, bison, reindeer, bears, and just about any other large animal can attack you, no matter how tame they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, you should be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded around the year 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor. This later became known as the infamous stalemate.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died during a nonviolent gathering in the city that got out of hand.
There are many beaches, particularly due to Auckland's two harbours. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
Along Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you'll find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good selection of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that isn't a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of milk (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but amazing.
Tours to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries resulting from these tours to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries north of Town of 1770 from October to April. They are sometimes also present outside of this period.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would actually swim away.
The primary habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, and they don't typically live in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other forms of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency as well.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast and airport transfers, and sometimes even packages with flights and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer for a bit longer or if you need to acquire documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or wish to make a change, you must do so through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
And remember this: even if the music on the main stages is over, music may still be playing in other parts of the festival grounds until the early hours.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Pay close attention to where your cabin is located when crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, because the passage through the ice makes a huge noise if you're too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos generally strive to maximize the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exit can sometimes be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic beverages. However, if people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know that staying sober is extremely important.
If you go high up into the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you must take into account that there may be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads there is little friction, which makes driving different than on asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to become trapped.
Visibility may also be impaired by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic is not hindered by them there.
The biggest African tourist attraction is safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their trip.
The term safari, in popular usage, refers to overland journeys to view the magnificent African wildlife, particularly on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment allows for a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs, and leopards, you need binoculars. Otherwise, there's little chance you'll see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'bush walk' or 'foot safari') involves walking for several hours or days at a time.
The Paralympics are from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events are held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in a precarious situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000. Regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer, if available.
Ensure the fabric doesn't get too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
You can purify water in various ways. Some methods are effective for addressing specific risks.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while in other areas, water needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Not all filters are equally effective. When in doubt, it's best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal plagues that do not exist in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill people, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can purchase goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers going to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially when it comes to products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, you often drive through deserted back country, and that makes this route a major challenge.
If you're not used to driving on country lanes, pay attention. You'll encounter many steep slopes, narrow streets, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent areas—usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and it's even more important to stick to them here than usual.
Surprisingly, you have much more reception here than in other remote areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great, and in Bavaria the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit pastries there. The pastries contain apples throughout the year, and in the summer months also cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but mighty pastries, try some that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen in the region.
To make a curry, you need spicy and flavorful ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the interior of North India and also of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used instead.
Indonesian cuisine encompasses dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simply spiced dishes. The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also cause safety issues because a rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but gets their foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged by the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, relatively narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups. These allow a stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards when a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces, which seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports involving descending, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes also called 'ski bums', who plan entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers that date back to 5000 BC!
The beginning of skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also known as off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It's not exactly the same, but it's similar to alpine skiing or mountaineering, which is often done on steep terrain. You need much stiffer skis and boots for it.
You can think of the ski route as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover greater distances than walking, but it rarely happens that you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared tracks without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for visas multiple times and undergo passport controls.
In this area, however, the Schengen Area functions almost as a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo passport control again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antique.
The definition may vary by location. For example, the age limit is lower in North America than in Europe.
It is possible to designate artisanal products as antiques, even if they are newer than comparable mass-produced items.
Among the Sámi, reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood. The culture surrounding the trade is also very important to many with other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry. They supported themselves through fishing, hunting, and similar activities. In these cases, reindeer were mostly used as draft animals.
Many Sámi people today work in modern professions. In Sápmi, the Sámi area, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is mainly used by non-Roma. However, it is also often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If a travel advisory applies to the country you are traveling to, this may have consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
Besides the advice from your own government, you can also consult the advice of other governments. However, their advice is geared towards their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Recommendations include only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often provide a fleeting, general, and extremely simplistic view compared to other, more detailed sources.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Phenomena and consequences of severe weather include, for example, strong winds, hail, large amounts of precipitation and wildfires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms are some examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions bring in their area, as these may also affect travel plans.
Anyone wishing to visit a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for 'hostile environment course' will likely return the address of a local company.
Typically, a course will cover all the issues outlined here in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, a lot of first aid, and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about surviving in the wilderness. However, there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have the correct documentation for their return journey.
It varies considerably whether authorities are willing to issue passports that do not specify a gender (X), or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much variation in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Moreover, searches at security checkpoints have become much more extensive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they will not pass through this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow onto the beach.
Due to the underwater topography, the return current is located in some deeper sections, where a rapid flow towards deep water can occur.
Most fatalities occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current. This could easily be impossible.
Once you're out of the strong current, swimming back is a piece of cake.
Try to focus on a spot where you won't be grabbed again. Depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than culture shock (you have less of a "honeymoon feeling"), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then return, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your own culture in the process.
Back then, when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding. They understood that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Usually, patience and understanding are not expected to be necessary for travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark, and you see them in complete silence before the show starts.
Often, the sounds of vendors and tourists are always audible here. The story of the light and sound is similar to that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids, and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have been claimed by various countries since then. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where you'll find the flooded crater of an active volcano serving as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula transition into the plateau, after which they reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, which is traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain at 4892 meters.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone service.
A satellite phone isn't really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite in order to make a phone call.
This service is frequently used by the shipping industry, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
Your local telephone provider can give you more information about how to connect to this service.
It's becoming increasingly popular for people planning a gap year to travel and learn.
School leavers, in particular, use this to take a gap year before university without negatively impacting their education.
Often, applying for a course abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of being accepted into higher education in your own country later.
Normally, tuition fees must be paid for registration for these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people boat in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This allows you to spend several full days in the historical town and stay overnight on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital, Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not located close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from many anxieties that other people also have.
Understanding how airplanes work can help alleviate a fear stemming from the unknown or from the feeling of having no control over the aircraft.
Courier companies receive a generous compensation for delivering items quickly. For business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could deploy their own aircraft for certain routes, but it became more difficult for other routes and smaller companies.
If they send things by air freight, it can take days on some routes for them to be unloaded and cleared through customs.
Only as checked baggage could this be processed faster. According to airline regulations, there must be an accompanying passenger, and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a hefty sum for this privilege (or, even better, have your employer do so).
However, this isn't cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times the economy class fare for business class, and about eleven times for first class.
It's usually pointless to look for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know all too well that there is a group of flyers willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the companies charge accordingly.
Chişinău is the Moldovan capital. The Romanian language is primarily spoken here, but the Russian language is also widely used.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova suffered under an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency but is not recognized by UN members.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center on a bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and modern shopping centers covered with red roof tiles, the 18th-century markets, the ancient mosques and churches, yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditionally Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a unique octagonal church.
Some graves near the church feature fascinating marble dove sculptures.
If you have half an hour, you should definitely take a look around this village.
In the north, you'll find the easily accessible, romantic, and fascinating town of Sintra. Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron spoke highly of the beautiful monuments there.
Scotturb bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra, with a stop in Cabo da Roca.
Also head north and see the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (a temple complex), where internationally renowned Marian apparitions have taken place.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, but also a place that holds an almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive, and many of them have loved ones who were murdered there or worked themselves to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
During your visit, display all due respect, solemnity, and dignity. Do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by applying markings or graffiti to the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are in Catalan, as that is the primary official language according to the law.
Spanish is spoken frequently on public transport and in other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English, and also Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known as selfish, rude, and arrogant.
While this is mostly just an inaccurate stereotype, it doesn't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-mannered). This will make it much easier to explore Paris.
The Parisians' tough exterior quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their ways.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, and this forested area consists mainly of beech, spruce, and fir trees, encompassing a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are a remarkably large number of different plant communities, due to the varying microclimates, the different soil types, and the varying differences in altitude.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie can be found there, in addition to all sorts of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt that covers the knees and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually, if you arrive at a monastery unprepared as a woman, you'll be given a shawl, but if you bring your own, with cheerfully garish colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile kindly at you.
On the other hand, men must wear trousers that reach at least over the knees.
You can also borrow one from the supply at the entrance, but this clothing isn't washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!
Just like many other Mediterranean regions, the Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and whatever seasonings are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, just like Sie which means You, are always capitalized at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
In this way, you make a significant distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier. Nevertheless, writing is more complex because you have to figure out whether to use a verb or adjective as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation generally poses few problems.
You should pay the most attention to the 'c' and the 'g'. Their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
You also have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means cart.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to the grammar will therefore already teach you a lot about the grammar of Persian and help you to understand sentences.
It's quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it's easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese resembles it so much that you don't need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now outdated and serve as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution wasn't such a big problem back then as it is now, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms, and this has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers, and that's where the concept originated.
The first cherry blossom festivals in Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look their best in a natural environment, so you should resist the urge to remove even 'just one' species.
If you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be immediately and without discussion denied access to the garden.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate, and almost everything is available there after arrival.
But if you're in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll experience both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less frequent).
There are also some buses heading north towards Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
Make sure to check carefully whether the bus you're taking actually goes into Hebron and doesn't just go to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great holiday destination.
You could, for example, visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Moreover, people who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians all over the world have adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
There's a tradition where you stay up all of Easter night until you can eventually see the sunrise.
Unsurprisingly, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as easily be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, an Easter Vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend. During this vigil, congregations often celebrate a feast in honor of the resurrection of Christ at the stroke of midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey. As a result, the giant tortoise became the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos, all sorts of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During the winter, the polar night occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance you can see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated, so light pollution is not often a problem. This means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal in nature than in the Western world.
Suits are standard work attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Consensus in the workplace is crucial. The focus is on group performance rather than praising individual work achievements.
Employees often have to get permission from their superiors before they can make a decision, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions mindlessly.
