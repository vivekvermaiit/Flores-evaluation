Many people conducted the initial testing of this research with various hardware and software components in February and announced it on Tuesday.
Possibly, comets are a source of water delivery to Earth along with the matter originating from space, which can build continents and support life.
Scientists hope to understand planet formation, especially that of Earth, because comets collided much earlier than Earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, began his guardianship in the previous year and last month signed a bill into law allowing same-sex marriage.
He refers to rumors as "political babble and folly."
The argument is that he will run for president in the year 2016.
NextGen is a program that allows FAA-owned aircraft to fly shorter routes, thus saving significant amounts of fuel.

Because extra tracks are not built, and overground trains are not stationed in Wembley, and parking garages and park and ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The fear of a transportation shutdown was made likely, because the team played behind closed doors without spectators.
A study published in a science journal on Thursday announced a new species of bird in the Gal√°pagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species has evolved through hybridization between two species, although this process will likely be short-lived, due to breeding between the local Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold will take the shape of all kinds of forms. It is wrapped in a small shape.
This can be drawn into thin fibers, which can be twisted and crimped. It can be matted into a felt or rolled into sheets.
This is extremely thin, comparable to metal. It is so thin that perhaps its use was to decorate hand-painted illustrations in "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with blood kombucha juice.
Does the juice of the Kambuka (snail/shell) change the color (of something) due to being acidic or containing alkali?
The pH level in a pH testing chemical (H in pH) is based on the quantity of hydrogen.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together and then, clean with damp hands, and then squeeze them into balls.
The moisture on the hands will react with the outer layers, creating a unique sensation and forming a kind of shield.
In both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a toilet, indicative of a golden age, along with a connected drainage system.
The water drainage system was found in the remaining houses of Minoan Crete and in the houses of Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and also China, toilets existed. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes together with public bathhouses where men and women were together.
When you make a call from a distance of a thousand miles, you are using a satellite.
The satellite, having been summoned into space, touches down, probably at that very moment.
The satellite was launched into space with a fire arrow (rocket). Scientists are conducting observation experiments in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and what we see.
A 100-foot tall rocket was used to launch a satellite or a weather observation device.
The wheel has changed the world in unbelievable ways. We have a great debt to the wheel, which has given us easy and fast transportation.
He bought for us a train, a car, and many other transportation vehicles.
Below them are many medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized targets, all the way from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, many cats (lazy, beloved cats are a help) appear and eat various small targets like animals, artificial animals, images, and birds.
The secret to their success is the idea of "Small Niche," which means each cat has a specific talent that outcompetes others.
Lions are, in many ways, social cats, whose large groups are proudly called prides.
The prank was conceived by one and three related adult men, along with a thirsty wife and a child.
A sister and daughters, together becoming the cause of a large family relationship, are close to one another.
Even though a lion's roar and the eating of goats is part of its nature, and its canine teeth are unique, the animal is still treated with awe like a lion (but not any other large cat), and even praying to it can be fatal.
A well-rounded athlete, who climbs like a tiger (though not perfectly), swims, jumps even from great distances, and pulls five times the strength of a vigorous man.
The tiger is one of the big cats (genus Panthera) along with the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's, which fills the entire throat; rather, its sound is harsh, a clamorous noise, and its utterance is fragmented.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. If necessary, it will restrain monkeys, snakes, birds, rodents, and so on. All the animals that the ocelot catches are very small.
The scientist thinks that the ocelot follows prey and also investigates food smells, even if it is on the ground.
They are able to see well in the dark with their night vision, and also advance forward very stealthily. Ocelots blend in with their surroundings and produce their own food.
When a large group (a substantial population) of living beings becomes separated from the main population, due to which it migrates (due to which it traverses a mountain range and rivers, or if it migrates to a new island), it is often found in a different environment, initially similar to the first.
In this new environment, with different resources and competitive situations, and as new entrants emerge, to become a powerful competitor like the predecessors, you will need to adopt different specializations.
The fundamental demographic should not change; it still requires adaptation to what it was previously.
With the passage of time, someone who says (or lives) in a new settlement adapts to the new environment; he would not see another settlement as minimal.
Ultimately, after thousands and millions of years, the two populations will become so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and also an important component of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen and also absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (that is, exhale during respiration).
Plants produce their own food through photosynthesis with the sun. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants, and also make clothes from plants. What we eat is plants. Without plants, animals do not live.
Mosasaurs was the apex predator of its time, therefore it was not afraid of anyone except other Mosasaurs.
In this creature's long jaws, more than seven extremely sharp teeth were set, and furthermore, on the upper part of its mouth was an extra tusk, meaning that if any object came in its path, there was no safeguard for that object.
We are uncertain, but it is possible that its tongue was barbed. Its diet consisted of turtles, long fish, and other mosasaurs, and it is also said that it was possibly a cannibal.
If any creature enters the water, then this one attacks; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T. Rex becomes less powerful in front of it.
Although we are familiar with most of their food, near Rome there was something like an awkward and unusual feast, in which dormice were the entree, along with wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent.
There was another difference: the poor people and women sat on the benches and ate food, whereas the rich people desired to eat food together, sitting comfortably in their own private areas during meal times.
In ancient Roman meals, food items could have been combined that came to Europe from America and Asia centuries later.
For example, there was no coriander, nor tomatoes, nor pumpkins, nor also gourds near him; moreover, ancient Roman people did not taste turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their deities, which was considered the god's home.
People offer sacrifices to the deity and the priests will try to partake in the benefit of the deities through ceremonies and fasting.
Each temple had an open courtyard and also an inner sanctum that only priests could enter.
Once, they built pyramids and ziggurats, whose shapes were like pillars, as parts of temples.
The pillar's summit was a special, sacred place of the Supreme Lord.
Due to the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life happened in the open air.
The women are cooking food in the courtyard, and soon there will be shops with unlocked cash boxes visible on the road. Stones were used for the construction of the house.
In the land of Canaan, there was no large forest, thus wood was very expensive.
Greenland was very sparsely populated. Norse sagas relate that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and that he then traveled further west, reached Greenland, and gave it the name Greenland.
However, the aim of his research was unimpeded; the Eskimo tribes lived there before that time.
Even though each country was Scandinavian, the Danish people, kings, customs, policies, and history had many differences.
If you watch the movie "National Treasure," then you will contemplate that the Declaration of Independence secretly concealed a valuable map.
Even though this is not true, even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a map to a valuable treasure.
Following the declarations of independence, the written words were "Major Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text was seen upside down at the very bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that it is a large vellum document called 'E' (it is a collection stored in a 29¬æ inch by 24¬Ω inch box).
Thus, it is likely that the signaling will be combined as just one label.
D-Day landing and the following war liberated the northern part of France, but the southern province was still not liberated.
This "Vichy" was not governed by the French. These were French people who made peace with Germany in 1940 and instead of fighting the invaders, cooperated with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces launched an attack on southern France, codenamed "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and advanced towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture that is shared by a significantly large group of people who coexist cooperatively and form a society that takes action.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means related to Latin citizens, which means city and city-state, and it also defines the shape of society in some way.
The city is the leader of states and nations. It is the meaning of a collection of civilizations and cultures, the transfer of knowledge among many lineages, a latent cultural footprint, and an impartial dissemination.
Popular culture often disappears without relevant historical evidence and also fails to adequately introduce the forms of appropriate civilizations.
Amidst revolutionary wars, the Three Stars State formed a weak center for all cities, although Congress was the sole component - according to the confederation's writing.
The Congress had no power to determine fees, and there was no national executive or judiciary; it depended on state officials, who were often uncooperative, making them the de facto reason for everything.
Among these kingdoms, there was no right to levy taxes justly or unjustly, or to impose unseen levies.
Before amending the article, the consensus of all the states was required, and the states generally felt that the central government's representation was often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Among popular sports, football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing etc. are included.
Winter sports are popular throughout the northern region, especially since Italy hosted international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is a country that includes almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island nation in the world.
Due to Japan possessing a chain/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in its geographical role.
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a station in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in the indigenous peoples' production methods and employing Chinese laborers in its rice and sugar plantations for livelihood.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, and in 1885, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which the Qing Dynasty relinquished its sovereignty over Taiwan and ceded it to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu holds three main structures named Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many buildings located on the borders of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a good idea of their original form.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration is still ongoing.
For example, 35 mm is the most common still photographic film format in the world, which was the dominant film format at the end of the symmetrical shutter era.
This is still produced today, but predominantly its viewing ratio is inherited through digital avatar monthly subscription formats.
In reality, the 35 mm format is sometimes, due to overlap, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this image (obtained by dividing by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Not many general structures (for example, the APS family of structures) are equally and densely close with this ratio.
The rule for the third case (instrumental) is greatly relaxed, almost ridiculed, by establishing the measurement of sequence in the image, creating dynamism, which is a simple guiding principle.
It says that the impactful position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds both horizontally and vertically (see example).
In European history, up to this period, the Catholic Church, which had become very wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
Despite some setbacks, the shared Christian faith, with its varying customs, bound European states together for over a thousand years. I...
This all-pervading power influenced the kings and the people.
A central Christian principle is that using wealth to alleviate suffering, poverty, and scarcity is a key reason for the church's monetary fund.
The central authority of the temple was in Rome for over a thousand years, and power and wealth were concentrated here, prompting many people to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Following the outbreak of hostilities, Britain immediately began a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy, disrupting the supplies of the army and also of the civilians, proved effective, although this blockade violated a generally accepted international rule, codified by various international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to block any ship entering from the ocean, causing fear even among neutral ships.
As long as there was little response to this strategy, Germany also expected such a response to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
In the 1920s, a prevailing approach among many citizens and nations was pacifistic and isolationist.
Having witnessed the horrific carnage and atrocities that occurred in the First World War, the nations desired to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In the year 1884, Mr. Tesla came to New York City in the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company.
He arrived in the US with only 4 coins, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation written to Thomas Edison by Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor).
Ancient China possessed unique ways to denote different periods. Each family that held power, marking a stage or era of China, was a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, in each dynasty, there was an unstable era of divided regions. Among these three periods, the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, was very famous.
In these times, fierce battles arose for the throne among many royal families fighting each other.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, in which thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne in the magnificent palace in Xi'an.
The adoption of the decimal system, the shift from autocracy to democracy, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to any ruler - these are some of the many social and political consequences.
Similarly, after the revolution, all activities that acknowledged the most victorious people and also the successful people for their success were open to all people of all professions.
Some are going into the army because army ranks are now based on merit rather than caste.
The French Revolution also inspired oppressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Mr. Muhammad, having transcended worldly life, possessed a strong yearning for things beyond. He would frequently go to a cave for contemplation, which became famous by the name "Hira" on a mountain known as "Noor" (light).
That cave, which became timeless, clearly shows the spiritual aspirations of Mr. Muhammad.
Located on one of the peaks in the mountains north of Mecca, that cave exists completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, even knowing that she exists, searching for her is not easy. After entering the cave, a complete isolation is experienced.
A clear, beautiful sky and, except for the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. After entering the cave, nothing from this world can be seen or heard.
Among the seven wonders, only The Great Pyramid at Giza still stands today.
Built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, this Great Pyramid is one of the massive pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh king.
The Giza Plateau of Egypt, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," holds several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to serve Pharaoh Khufu. And numerous small obelisks, tombs, and temples were built to serve Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like a V, and the "down bow" symbol looks like a tenon (or connector), or like a baseless rectangle.
Up means that you should start from the top position and draw the bow. And Down means that you should start from the bottom (which is where your bow-holding hand is) and pull the bow.
The upward-facing bow usually creates a gentle sound, while the downward-facing bow is more powerful and insistent.
Feel free to mark your goals with arrows, but understand that printed targets are for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forcibly returned from the city of Versailles to the city of Paris by market women on October 6, 1789.
Surrounded by a crowd of people proclaiming and denouncing the quarrel between the king and queen, they returned to the city of Paris in one cart.
The crowd forcefully urged the king and queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
In a moment, in a crowd, someone brandished the brain of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, before the terrified king.
Due to the invasion of U.S. imperialism in the Philippines, the war expenses incurred were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were used to pay taxes in order to liquidate a large portion of the US's colonial expenses, and bond increases were arranged in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
Indeed, the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people has contributed profits to the intrinsic gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the context that motivated the creation of this system, it is necessary to know the warrior clans.
When these events occurred, that era is generally known in European history as the High Middle Ages, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000-1300).
The early medieval period occurred before these high middle ages, and then the late middle ages, which successively ended in the 15th century, came into being.
Technological determinism is a concept with diverse practical considerations, such as technological imperative or technological law, according to which human destiny is driven by scientific methods and, collectively, their manifestations in technology.
Technological determinism, in its many interpretations, holds two main ideas: technology follows its own path, independent of cultural or political influence, and because of this, technology has inherent "effects" on social matters, which are intrinsic rather than socially constructed.
For example, it can be said that a car definitely promotes road development.
A nationwide road network may become economically unsustainable due to the number of vehicles; therefore, a new production method is emerging to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning many cars can lead to more accidents on the roads, therefore, new innovations in health technology offer the possibility of protecting damaged bodies.
Inspired by Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, this romantic notion underpinned a significant emphasis on cultural determinism.
In the context of imaginative appeal, geography has shaped individuals, and over time, traditions and culture associated with that geography have ascended. These were better than arbitrarily established rules due to their coherence with the social environment.
In the same way, Paris is known as the capital of contemporary global modernity, while Constantinople is considered the capital of feudal European modernity.
That, famous as the central area of pleasure, began in the 400th year and continued approximately from the 1100th year.
In the twelfth century, its status declined primarily because warriors returned from campaigns with silk fabrics and other gifts, which caused them to fetch higher prices in Byzantine markets.
At that very time, the title of "New Capital City" was transferred from the city of Constantinople to the city of Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was extremely influenced by the pre-existing Byzantine culture.
Even so, due to slow transmission channels, Western techniques were established 25-30 years late.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. This was one of the most significant developments of that time, as people began using buttons to fasten their clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of agriculture in which enough grain is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is simple and mostly organic. In this, locally adapted seeds that are not tied to ecosystems are used, and simple techniques like crop rotation are employed to increase production.
Historically, many farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture. And similarly, even now, this (practice) continues in some developing countries.
Organizations unite marginalized people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of belonging.
Subcultures can be distinguished by factors such as age, ethnicity, class, location, and gender of their members.
Linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a mixture of various factors are the qualities that characterize subcultures.
Often, subculture members signal their membership through a distinctive symbolic usage of style, incorporating new fashions, codes of conduct, and slang.
One common method used to highlight the importance of socialization is to expose cases of children who were unsocialized by their parents due to neglect, misfortune, or outright abuse, during their upbringing.
These children are known as "feral" or wild. Some feral children are restrained by people (usually even by their own parents). In some cases, child abandonment occurs due to a child's severe intellectual or physical impairment, leading to their rejection by their own caretakers.
The barbarian children might have experienced very intense exploitation or disaster somewhere before abandonment or escape.
Others were accused of being raised by animals, while some were said to have lived in the forest on their own.
When this Barbarika, nurtured by inhuman animals, displays behaviors (with physical boundaries) like a pet animal, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
It is expected that learning in a project-based study will be easier and more interesting, and the platform is moving one step forward.
Mentoring is not a method of study, but rather an aid that supports individuals gaining new learning experiences through the use of new computer systems or the initiation of new projects.
Performances can be illusory and yet also be real. In other words, just as a teacher is a type of performance, so too is a cursor in Microsoft Office.
Illusionary platforms are integrated within the software itself, and processes such as asking questions, giving suggestions, and similarly, inviting and controlling students need to be clarified.
Children are placed in foster homes due to various broad reasons such as neglect, condemnation, or coercion.
No child should grow up in a nurturing-poor, compassionless, and uneducational environment, but they do grow up in such environments.
We hope that the foster homes will be like a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is expected to provide safe homes, caring providers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster home is expected to provide all the necessities that were lacking in their previous home, from where these children were taken.
The internet connects people and the elements of public interaction.
The unique characteristics, diverse types, approaches, uses, and benefits of the internet should be understood.
For example, "knowing" and "socializing" were identified as forms of important motivation for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal participation" and "held relationships" were equated by MM and McCord (1998) as a novel inspirational insight when they investigated responses regarding listener networks.
The use of image printing has led to significant discoveries in the revelation of subtle emotions and facial expression movements, only in a few thousandths of a second.
It is specifically stated that a person can discern subtle cues and thereby recognize whether another person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper titled "The President's Speech," showed how people with aphasia (speech impairment due to brain damage), though unable to understand speech, are nonetheless able to determine truthfulness effectively.
He also indicates that such capacities, which are indicative of human behavior, can be shared to some extent even with trained dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variation - hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it based on differential expression of that variation.
Separation and recombination remove the distinction between the two differences both behind and in front, level by level.
On dry, grassy ground, it is difficult for a mammal, which has a digestive system like a human, to fulfill its amino acid requirements from the available plant sources.
Thereafter, failure in the completion of this leads to developmental regression, malnutrition and ultimately death; these are the serious consequences.
Proteins found in leaves and legumes among readily available plant sources may exist, but their digestion without cooking is more difficult for mammals like us.
Moreover, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also contain all the essential amino acids and provide proteins.
If, keeping all this in mind, we ought not to be surprised, then our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way like that of chimpanzees on a dry, grassy ground, with something taken.
Nidravimarda is the process of waking up purposefully from the usual sleep time and then falling asleep again after a short period (10-60 minutes).
Through the application of relative quiescence and wakefulness, bringing you completely from unawareness to consciousness can be easily accomplished.
If you put the alarm clock back to its original state while still half-asleep, then you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed abruptly to turn it off.
Other practices based on lifestyle include drinking excessive fluids before sleep (especially water or tea, known diuretics) so that one wakes up abruptly to urinate.
The measure of a person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the anxiety residing in their body and mind.
With less anxiety, there would be a greater presence of life energy. All people deserve to attain complete peace and resolution.
All people can attain knowledge. Self-doubt and negativity - these two stand as obstacles on our path to our goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but is expanded through the path of compassion of the Mahayana school and also through Indian Yoga Tantra.
Tibetan Buddhism, in essence, is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and an all-encompassing path of love.
Kundalini energy (the energy of awakening) is awakened with Kundalini Yoga, along with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the heart of Tibetan Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and an awakened consciousness is cultivated.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, bringing together the USSR and the USA in cooperation. The conflicts that arose at the end of the war in systems, processes, and cultures led to the disappearance of many countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former friends had now become enemies, and a civil war had begun.
This Cold War lasted for 40 years, and proxy armies fought this war in several war zones from the continent of Africa to the continent of Asia, as well as in Afghanistan, Cuba, and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was completely shattered. And the only hope was retreat and reorganization through the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans went awry in a single night when an army of over 800,000 from the Soviet Union, called the Union Red Army, arrived, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and also numerous other international treaties, crossing the eastern border of Poland and forming Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
The use of ships for transporting goods is still the best way to easily transport a large number of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the function of naval forces is to disrupt the transport capacity of the enemy's people and goods, as well as simultaneously interdict the transport capacity of the enemy's people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II is a most remarkable modern example of this. Americans were trying to transport people and goods to aid Britain.
At that very time, the German army was primarily trying to stop this traffic by using U-boats.
If the Allied nations falter in this endeavor, then Germany may be able to conquer Britain, just as it did the rest of Europe.
It is believed that goats were domesticated rapidly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribal communities domesticated them for easy access to their milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Generally, goats, having been sheared while grazing in the pastures on the mountains, were sent to the kids. These young boys or adolescents were widely known everywhere by the name "goat herders". These methods of goat herding are still employed even now.
In the 16th century, roadways were constructed in England.
Although the roadways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to attain greater speed and to carry large loads over rough roads in fewer days.
Initially, cross ties were used to hold the railway tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more robust if iron straps were placed on top of them.
This was a common practice, but due to the iron, the wooden wheels of the vehicles became more worn.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In the year 1767, the first iron vehicles were presented for the first time.
The first known transportation is walking. Humans began upright walking with the emergence of Homo erectus (upright man) 2 million years ago.
Their ancestors, known as Australopithecus, were not always able to perform standing and walking.
Bipedal specializations of Australopithecus are found in remains from 4.2-3.9 million years ago. However, it is believed that Sahelanthropus practiced bipedalism 7 million years ago.
We can live more harmoniously with the environment. We can participate in the environmental movement. And we can become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
However, this seems like a symptomatic treatment in several respects. Even so, if we want not only a temporary solution, then the root of our problems must be investigated. Thereafter, those problems must be remedied.
It is definitely enough to say that due to the scientific and technological advancements of humankind, this world has undergone a great transformation. And also, due to the large population and the frenzied lifestyle of humans, problems have multiplied.
Following the acceptance by the General Assembly on July 4th, and after the signing by the President of the General Assembly, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, a handwritten document was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, located far away, from some city departments.
Around midnight, 150-200 copies known as "Dunlap Broadsides" were printed.
The first public reading of the document was done by Mr. John Nixon on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of those was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read before his soldiers in New York City on July 9th. A copy was sent to London on August 10th.
The oldest surviving copies of this document are still 25 Dunlap broadsides. No copy with original signatures remains.
Currently, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We know them by the name birds.
Many people do not consider those to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and they are able to fly.
But there are not many things by which birds appear like monitor lizards.
Their feet are equipped with claws and horns. They lay eggs and, like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, they move on two feet.
Indeed, all computers currently in use are based on a predefined system of information expressed in binary numbers.
A binary number holds only one value of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits or bits for use in computer terminology.
The poison inside might not be immediately visible. Symptoms resembling vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made quickly.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container or household chemical poison.
The label with specific first aid instructions for the particular poison should be examined.
Entomologists formally use the term "insect" for these groups of insects.
This study is based on the ancient knowledge of cat fleas, which are insects adapted specifically to human life.
Bed bugs and certain mites are said to be nest dwellers, as they are adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to be affected by MS (Multiple Sclerosis).
This couple should ensure that having more children is not beneficial for them or for their child.
These couples might consider bringing a foster care plan for their child.
In the process of adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights permanently so that another couple may raise the child.
The main goal of science is that this world should function according to scientific principles. This principle truly guides many scientific studies.
This experiment is not only unique. An experiment is a test that can be used to reject one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observation also show the way for scientific research.
Naturalist philosophers focused their attention particularly on the classical texts available in Latin, especially the Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
When the knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the Western world became separated from its Greek philosophy and classical roots.
Many people observed that the rhythms present in physiology and behavior are definitely based on the existence of internal chakras and their construction by a biological clock.
Circadian rhythms, which are merely reactive to external time cues, have been documented for many living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle of temporal measure even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the experiments that prominently indicated that DNA is genetic material.
Mr. Harsha and Mr. Che used viruses to transplant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments - either by labeling the DNA component of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or by labeling the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur.
Mutation can have various consequences depending on the type of difference. For example, the meaningfulness of the affected genetic material segment, as well as whether the affected cells are somatic cells or germline cells.
Only mutations occurring in germline cells are passed on to children; other mutations cause death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts enthusiasts who go to experience the beauty of natural areas rich in flora and fauna.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting gardens, and the study of ecosystems are examples of fieldwork activities.
An example is‚Äîthe study of orangutans in Borneo, photographing them, and visiting their habitats.
Every morning, people leave small villages by vehicles to go to their workplaces, and those vehicles are given to those people whose workplace is the place that has been left by these (first) people.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation system, each person is connected to the conventional transportation based on their private vehicle.
Science now indicates that the carbon-based economy has displaced the stable state of the biosphere that has been the basis for humanity for the last two million years.
In society, every person participates and also utilizes the transportation system. Usually, every person criticizes the transportation system.
Such condemnation regarding water quality and bridge collapses is rarely heard in developed countries.
Why does the transportation system generate such objections? Why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers, vehicles, and their interactions between two points.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because a driver's behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Due to good fortune, the behavior of drivers tends to remain at a consistently appropriate level. Thus, the pattern of traffic flow becomes somewhat continuous and therefore difficult to model mathematically.
To better manage traffic flow, relationships must be established among three important characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections will be helpful in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects, flying in the sky, are the first creatures. Their ability to fly has helped them easily escape their enemies, search for food, and also mate.
The fact that some insects can fold their wings onto their backs is advantageous for them.
This provides an extensive network of small shelters to protect them from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings on their backs.
A thousand years ago, a certain person named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believed that he was speaking the truth, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system (along with other stars), connected to the sun, revolved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable because the Earth does not appear to be rotating, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and also the widest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the next largest river.
The Amazon River is the widest river on Earth, and in some places it is up to 6 miles wide.
20 percent of the water carried from the Earth's rivers to the oceans is from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of rivers.
Although the construction of stone pillar monuments continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the pillar monuments at Giza remained unsurpassed due to their size and the excellent technical skill involved in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom marveled at the monuments made by their ancestors, which were 1000 years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its constitution and also in official communications.
Italian is a language used daily by many people working in that country, just as Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, copper, etc., since ancient times. All of these can be found in nature in their elemental forms and can be mined relatively easily with ordinary tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, propounded the theory that everything is made up of one or a combination of many of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These were like the four states of matter (in sequence) - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also stated that they transform into new substances to acquire whatever form we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Potassium and chlorine, such elements are considered metals. Certainly, they are metals like silver and gold, as well as other metals.
You can also obtain alloys containing non-metallic elements, similar to those found in kaukiliya.
In the entire universe, everything is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that dwarfs of their size could fit in the space at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pen was made, it became a good companion for many people.
It is painful that when new writing technologies arose, the pen was relegated to an inferior position and diminished to fewer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, so they no longer have to send them by carrier pigeon.
People can only imagine what the future of the keyboard will be when something new is revealed.
A fission-fusion device operates on the principle that it absorbs energy to hold a nucleus together, which consists of multiple protons and neutrons.
This is like a heavy cart teetering on top of a mountain. The rupture of the cell nucleus releases some fraction of energy once again.
Some atoms possess unstable nuclei. This means that they tend to break apart with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
This crust is 70 kilometers thick in nearby places and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
This is more sparse beneath the large, black stones, and denser beneath the high lands.
Dark, vast rocks are more likely to exist in the nearby location because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to float on the surface.
Subject theories are focused on exploring what motivates people to act or what they like.
These principles indicate that people hold certain needs and desires that are inherent in their growing age.
These theories observe why some people like doing whatever they are doing, and what environmental factors motivate them to do or not do specific actions.
There are two popular content theories - Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two trends emerge when leaders begin to bring in their former associates. One side tries to maintain the status quo of "one of the boys (or girls)."
Such a manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, in disciplinary actions, in performance evaluations, in assigning responsibility, and in holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unfamiliar individual who believes that everything done by the group should be changed and that they alone should do it.
Ultimately, the leader alone is responsible for the success or failure of the organization.
This behavior does not only culminate in discord among the leaders but also among the other members of the group.
Illusory collectives, like traditional collectives, are judged on similar standards of excellence, but subtle differences exist even there.
The volunteer members frequently act as points of contact for their respective local physical groups.
They possess greater autonomy than traditional group members because their groups meet according to different time zones, which is not always understood by their local management.
The presence of an actual "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique element of a seeming team.
The "Invisible Group" is a management group to which all members report. The Invisible Group sets the standards for all members.
Why did some organization want to undergo a time-consuming process to establish an educational institution? One goal is creativity to bring organizational learning concepts into practice.
When all available resources are utilized effectively across the departments of an organization, then creativity and innovation can be manifested.
As a result, the collaborative process leads the organization to overcome problems and towards a new creative process to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can become creative, leadership should build a culture of creativity, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies Continuous Auditing as a process-oriented approach, facilitated by mechanisms that help in achieving a higher level of operational effectiveness.
Neuroscientific data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating experience. Therefore, it narrows the field of inquiry and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavior gives scientists support in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and inflammations affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore unprecedented brain structures and processes.
Creating computational models allows us to understand mental processes, and this provides us with a wealth of detail and resources.
Although AI strongly holds the meaning of science fiction, nevertheless, AI constitutes an important branch of computer science that creates machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
This work involves creating machines that can motivate themselves, requiring the application of intelligent behavior modification in "E, Ai, and I".
It includes control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to address customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and face.
Such objects are developed by independent branches that give attention to devising solutions to real-life problems.
AI technology is frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military science, as well as being integrated into many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are a significant part of any class. Often, the teacher wants to take their students to such places where bus travel is not an option.
Tantra technology provides a way as a virtual field trip. Students can experience visiting museum artifacts, going to an aquarium, or appreciating beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Structuring a field trip with an apparent form, reflecting on the trip, and doing so is a great way, and an excellent method for imparting experiences to future classes.
For example, every year Bennett School in North Carolina plans a trip to the state's capital city. Every year the itinerary is redesigned, but old versions are kept as transcripts.
Even online communities can help to improve students' writing skills. As long as students begin to share their online experiences with proper grammar and spelling, the reader's presence generally transforms it.
Because the students are excellent critical readers, therefore the web writer begins efforts to revise the writing well and to avoid criticism.
Similarly, creating web diagrams encourages students to understand the world around them more thoroughly, and the need to nourish the readers' aesthetic sense motivates students to become clever and aesthetically sensitive.
Collaborative writing is a tool that fosters cooperation and encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional school days.
The appropriate use of online tools empowers students to become more analytical and critical through responding to online literature. Students can define their own positions in relation to specific topics through the context of others' writings and through their own perspectives. (Oravec, 2002)
Ottawa is the beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada, and it showcases rows of art galleries and museums that display Canada's past and present.
Far away in the southern direction lies Niagara Falls. And also in the northern direction is the region of Muskoka, a region like a home to the untouchable natural beauty.
All these things, and also the more widely known Ontario province, are considered by travelers to be quintessentially Canadian.
Far to the north are vast expanses, sparsely populated and also some uninhabited wild areas.
To illustrate the size of the population, which surprises many - the number of African Americans living in the US is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, far off the East African coast.
Madagascar is the largest and most unique continent when it comes to its wildlife.
The smallest islands are independent nations, are united with France, and are called the "French Riviera Resort".
The Arabs brought the religion of Islam to other lands as well, thus leading a vast path to the states of Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, that field is bordered by Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
It has been indicated to the woman that any female travelers who state they are married will be considered as such, regardless of their actual marital status.
Even holding one finger, he is helpful (even though he may not appear valuable).
Women should ensure that they criticize and follow up on the fact that cultural disputes result in rape, and that being grabbed by the arm is not unusual.
Attract people and be strong, and may you stand firm on your principles and not be fearful (whether cultural conflicts exist or not, let it not matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a trading port named Anfa.
The Portuguese people destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt that city under the name Dar el-Beida, and the Spanish merchants who established a trading post there named it Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least attractive places for travel.
Around the ancient medina, stalls offering traditional Moroccan goods are readily available, a full spectrum of items like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and trinkets, but all of this is for the tourists.
Goma city, a tourist destination of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is located absolutely east of Gisenyi city in Rwanda.
In the year 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, and the city center was burned down especially intensely by looters in that city.
Goma city is mostly safe, but travel outside of Goma city in North Kivu province needs to be investigated to understand the war situation there.
This city is a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and some, along with others, follow the Grauer's gorilla in Africa.
You use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). For a short distance, the price is usually 500 Congolese Francs.
Gathered with its inherent inaccessibility, "Timbuktu", foreign, has become figuratively used for far-off places.
Today, Timbuktu is a largely impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and there is an airport there.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage sites due to the upwelling of sand from the desert.
Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "African American Lives" became a major phenomenon at the time.
This city is completely different from the rest of the country's cities because it has a maximal Arabian style with insular expectations.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, the border with Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km¬≤ and is divided into 14 distinct eco-zones, each supporting different wildlife.
That is a major attraction of South Africa and it is prominent in the South African National Parks (SANParks).
All South African National Parks have daily conservation and entrance fees.
This Wild Card is also beneficial to one as it grants access to one or more South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong territory its name, and this place attracts many tourists as a major focal point.
The vibrant skyline of Hong Kong, with its procession of new buildings, is likened to a glittering tapestry, an effect heightened by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island is largely constrained by its narrow connection to the northern shore.
This place was created by British colonial settlers for themselves, and therefore, if you are researching the history of the colonial area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, extending 80km (50 mi) inland from the coast across Bangladeshi and Indian rural coastal areas.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The forest area at the end of India is called Sundarban National Park.
Although the forests are not merely rough scrubland, they encompass remnants of vast woodlands that once covered the entire Indus Valley region.
Sundarbans encompass an area of 3850 km¬≤, of which approximately one-third is covered by water.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 deer in that area.
Space shuttles travel to the Inter-Orbital Space Station (North Quay) daily, although mostly, specifically they go via Jakar/Bumthang in the east, departing between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since interplanetary spacecraft are always full, it is suggested to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are reliable and durable.
Shared taxis are available to nearby places that are fast and convenient, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two Lasaka are 83 units high, and 378 units long, and it has two side paths near it that are 3.50 meters wide.
The perpendicular offset is 15 units. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points will be closed.
The Guarani are the largest indigenous group currently living in eastern Paraguay, residing as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chako area is like a home to various foreign communities who hunt, gather, and practice networking for their livelihood.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was then called "the gigantic province of the Indies," a result of conflicts between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The colonization of the country by the Spanish people began and lasted for three centuries.
In 1537, following the Asunci√≥n investigation, Paraguay carefully forged its own national character and personality.
Argentina is famous in the world for its excellent polo team and players.
The year's big team game takes place in December at Las Canitas in the polo field.

From news about group sports and for competition, where do the tickets come from? Check the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The functional currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British Pound (GBP).
The money can only be transferred to the island's treasury, which is located across from the Stanley F.I.C. West branch.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and in Stanley, integration papers and US Dollars are also accepted.
Remote islands do not accept checks, although they sometimes accept British and United States currency; check with the authorities before proceeding to determine an approved method of remitting funds.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is practically impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern part, and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures exceeding +30¬∞C are common.
It is winter, there is fog and frost, the temperature steadily falls below freezing, but the air is humid as well, which makes it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There, distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons do not exist; the amount of rainfall is uniformly and rapidly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals of the garden come into the sight of humans, still, wildlife is wild, and do not disturb it.
According to the garden authorities, bears and foxes must stay at least 100 yards/meters away, and all other animals must stay 25 yards/meters away.
In fact, they have seen humble ITI bison, elk, moose, bear, and also nearly every large animal attack.
Every year, dozens of ITI (Industrial Training Institute) visitors are harmed because they do not stand at a proper distance. This animal is large, wild, and also potentially dangerous; therefore, give it its space.
Furthermore, it was understood in this matter that the scent attracts bears and other wildlife; therefore, protect fragrant food items being transported and cooked, and also maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave the port.

Jellyfish boxes have been found north of 1770, from October to April, near the sea coast and river mouths. They are sometimes found outside of this time period.
Sharks exist, although they probably sometimes attack humans. Usually, sharks are also afraid of humans and swim away when they swim far.
The crocodile does not actively live in the salty water of the ocean; its primary habitat is the mouths of the northern rivers from Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives peace of mind to travelers, knowing they have a place to sleep near their destination upon arrival.
The travel agent usually has deals with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, as destinations can be reached through a travel agent.
Typically, a travel agent presents this package which includes airfare, connecting flights, hotel package, breakfast, and transportation arrangements.
They are able to hold the reservation for you if you grant time for consideration or if time is needed to gather other documents for your destination (for which you need a visa).
Even if someone sends a modification or request through their original travel agent, it will not be passed on to the hotels.
Someone decided to build a camp near the large majority of people attending the music concert at the festival, and most attendants considered it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be near the Kauai people, then you should go quickly to get a campsite near the music.
Recall that even though the main part of the music is finished, this is a portion of the festival that will continue late into the night, conducted with that music.
During some festivals, a special camp area is set up for the family of the young boy.
If it crosses the northern Baltic in winter, then inspect the place, because there is an extremely frightening sound to the people most affected by crossing through the ice.
The time in St. Petersburg for sightseeing is included. Visa requirements are reduced for cruise passengers (check the conditions).
Casinos generally try to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, making it difficult to know when to return.
The guests are treated with kindness and are protected within the premises, and therefore they are usually offered special food, drinks, and entertainment nearby.
He sends alcoholic beverages to a few places in the house. Although, drinking impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of remaining calm.
Anyone who drives to high altitudes and mountainous regions must consider the possibility of encountering frost, snow, and cold temperatures.
Even snow and snow friction happen in small amounts, and you cannot drive like that on an unpaved road.
During periods of heavy rain with frost, you are adequately restrained because the frost, being very light, is able to fall in a short time.
Visibility in the garden will be restricted due to falling snow, or dense fog, or the accumulation of snow.
Elsewhere, in many countries, frost and freezing conditions are common. Also, throughout the year, traffic often moves in a restricted manner.
Safari is possibly the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and will continue to attract many visitors.
In popular usage, the word safari has come to refer to trips, especially overland journeys in the savanna, to view the spectacular African wildlife.
A few animals, including an elephant and a giraffe, came near the four-wheeled vehicle and will allow a proper viewing of standard equipment.
