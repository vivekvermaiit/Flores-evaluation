One antiviral cocktail, "Zmapp", was initially promising in this area, but official studies show that it has less benefit in preventing death than expected.
In the "PALM" trial, "Zmapp" served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatment methods to it.
The U.S. Gymnastics organization supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the Olympic family's absolute necessity to ensure a safe environment for all athletes.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides information that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top with white or carotenoid colors underneath.
This finding also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a "rachis", but have other feather features - branched barbs and barbules - researchers have concluded that the "rachis" likely developed later in the course of evolution.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers assumed that, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows the plumage of an adult specimen, not downy fluff of a chick.
Researchers agreed that, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows the plumage of an adult specimen, not a chick's down.
Yesterday morning in Gaziantep, Turkey, a car was blown up at the police headquarters, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Strelnik galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon interacts with Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also interacts with the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a halo-like structure and it is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters seclude themselves in a booth, place a printed paper slip with their desired candidate indicated on it into an envelope.
After the staff checks the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
The French election law very strictly codifies the process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no other envelopes are added, except those that have been duly counted and given to the voters.
Candidates can send representatives to see every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In her second competition, the giant slalom, she achieved tenth place in the women's group with a total running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Læsch, who achieved first place, and 1:09.02 slower than the ninth-place finisher Genghi Dani from Hungary.
In the women's group, four skiers did not finish their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 giant slalom skiers did not qualify for the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kandžars, Buta Kandžars, Rampro Kandžars, Gaza Kandžars and Višnu Kandžars.
Police inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused arrived in court with covered faces.
Even though the car crashed into the house, there were three people inside, none of whom were injured.
However, the driver had serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT car.
Initially, he was hospitalized in James Paget Hospital in the Great Yarmouth state.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoja is found in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of the murder of her son.
She is in custody, awaiting indictment and trial, but all eyewitness evidence may be tainted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a widespread practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish legal system works differently, and the courts have considered that publishing photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists, by publishing photos of suspects, etc., are walking a dangerous path".
The Crown Prosecution Office, which is generally responsible for criminal prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be provided at least until charges are brought.
The document, in connection with the information leak, refers to the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants, based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other discussed topics, as reported, include the future Jerusalem state, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel proposes a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, but Palestine agrees to such a presence only for five years.
The subjects of the additional pest control experiment had to be strictly supervised by foresters, because they monitored the experiment and evaluated its effectiveness afterwards.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were employed in the hunting program.
According to what NPWS Park Protection and Heritage Director's duties fulfiller Mika O'Flin said, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelejs yesterday took the oath in the new Provisional Election Council (CEP), which has nine members.
This is Marteleja's fifth Provisional Election Council in four years.
Last month, the president's commission recommended the resignation of the previous Interim Election Council as part of a set of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Marteleja's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Other times, violent protests were triggered by the failure to organize elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
It has been reported about approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating, caused by improper operation, in total causing six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded, calling Apple's postponement of the message "truly regrettable."
An earthquake shook the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management reported that no reports of damage have been received in the state.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there had been no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has detained Hong Kong tourists, stealing their bus in Manila - the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several detainees were rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six detainees, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographer later took the old lady's place because she needed to attend charity. Mendoza nodded.
Liginss followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He studied to be an obstetrician and started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liginss started researching premature births in his free time.
His research showed that if the hormone were introduced, it would accelerate the maturation of the child's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black box" flight recorders.
The moon was also honored by wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager. Luna died on a two-moon night. Pretty unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dastins "Goldasts" Ranels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as I am... Maybe even more so... I loved her, and I miss her.. Hopefully, she is in a better place now."
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who support Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents agree with this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the final results of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim the 100 and 200 m freestyle and three relays at the Friendship Games, but complaints about his physical fitness have raised concerns.
He couldn't use the medicine that was needed to overcome the pain, because it is prohibited in competitions.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
By the beginning of February, several people confirmed the discovery, using various equipment and software, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Possibly, comets were a source of water supply to Earth along with organic substances that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets have long collided with Earth.
The 53-year-old began his duties as Governor of Como at the beginning of this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called these rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
They say that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technologies, so that air traffic controllers can more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transport will not be added, overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no access to car parking spaces and parking or driving opportunities on the ground.
Fears about the lack of transport created the possibility that the game would have to be forcibly held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal "Science" on Thursday reports the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed in only two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, because the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, interbred.
Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn out into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be flattened or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that at one time it was used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen (H and pH) ions in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then, with clean, damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The cream on your hands will react with the outer layers, this will create a strange sensation and form a kind of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and the settlements of Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women found themselves together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and almost immediately reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and visibility.
To deliver a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket is needed, the height of which exceeds 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in unbelievable ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is much simpler and faster transportation.
This has brought us trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Underneath them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and seals.
Finally, there are many small cats (including cats that live both indoors and outdoors) that eat many more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Your secret to success is a niche concept — every cat has a specific job that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, who live in large groups called prides.
The family consists of one to three closely related adult females, as well as up to thirty mothers with young.
Mothers are usually very connected to each other, forming a large sister and daughter family.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf and dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are very deadly to their prey.
A well-prepared athlete, a tiger, can climb (even if not very well), swim, run long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar, but rather more like a growling and screaming sentence of words.
Ocelots gladly eat small animals. If they can, they hunt lizards, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists think that ocelots track the animals they eat (prey) and find them by scent, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island, so that it is not so easy to move back), they will often end up in a different group than they were before.
This new environment has all kinds of resources and all kinds of competitors, therefore the new inhabitants will need other functions or adaptations in order to be strong competitors.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as new inhabitants begin to adapt to the new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will look so different that they will not even be able to be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which usually means the formation of new species. Speciation is like an inevitable consequence and a very important component of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the main predator of that time, therefore he was not afraid of anyone, except for his own species' brethren.
In its long jaw, it had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an extra set in the upper part of its mouth, meaning there was no salvation for anyone who crossed its path.
It is not exactly known, but it may have had a sharp tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, other small reptiles, and it possibly could have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anyone who entered the water, even a huge dinosaur like T. rex wouldn't bother it.
Although most of your food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, shellfish, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate food sitting in chairs, rich men liked to organize banquets together, where they ate lying on their sides.
In ancient Roman meals, there could not have been included foodstuffs that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which they considered to be the god's home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard, and after that, the inner sanctuary, which only priests could access.
Other times, especially pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of a temple.
The tower's summit was like a special god's sanctuary.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, shelter was not so important.
The biggest part of Jewish family life took place in the open air.
The women were cooking in the yard, the shops were just open stalls turned towards the street. Stone was used for house construction.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Scandinavian sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, a tribe of Eskimos already lived there at that time.

If you have seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was an inscription: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although nobody knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (its dimensions are 29¾ x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, most likely, the designation was simply attached as a label.
D-Day's landing and the following battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
Those were the "Vichy" French in power. They were French people who had concluded peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders, rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, calling the invasion "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means "civil," related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and this also, to a certain extent, determines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilization's culture signifies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, the presence of a lasting cultural imprint, and their honorable dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear, leaving behind no relevant historical evidence, and they are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government — whose only component was the Congress — according to the articles of confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, since there was no state executive or judicial power, the implementation of acts was entrusted to state institutions, which often did not cooperate.
He also didn't have the right to ignore tax laws and duties between states.
The amendments required the unanimous consent of all states to be amended, and the states treated the central government so carelessly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup title in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern regions, Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because of the group of islands located in Japan, Japan is often geographically called an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by called the island "Ilha Formosa" or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration has continued to this day.
For example, the world's most widespread still image photography format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue cinema era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio is adapted to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Actually, the 35 mm format is a bit confusing, being 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family) have the same aspect ratio or are close to it.
The heavily misused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while preserving the order of the image.
It says there that the most effective location for the main object is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had remained wealthy and powerful, was examined in detail.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound European states together, even though they differ in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power influenced everyone – from kings to ordinary inhabitants.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are intended precisely for this purpose.
The church's central power was in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised many questions about whether this principle was being observed.
Soon after the start of hostilities, Great Britain began a blockade of the German fleet.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off important military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified in several international treaties concluded over the last two centuries.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering healthy ocean areas, creating dangers even for neutral ships.
Since this tactic had a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism prevailed in the attitudes of most citizens and states.
After the horrors and mercilessness of the First World War, countries wanted to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America and accepted a job at Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in America with four cents, a hymn book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showcasing different time periods; each Chinese phase or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty reigned an unstable era of divided provinces. The most recognizable of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce battles took place between many nobles, who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying while fighting for the highest position in the great Sian palace.
There are many social and political effects, for example, the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, job positions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military sphere; instead of the army rank being based on classes, it was based on "caliber".
The French Revolution also inspired many people from the repressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond worldly life. He often visited a cave to contemplate, which became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light).
he himself lived in a cave, which having survived the ages, provides a very vivid insight into Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
Located on one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, it's not so easy to find at all, even if someone knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it's complete isolation.
You can't see anything else, only the clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding hills. Inside the cave, you can see and hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that has survived.
The Great Pyramid, which the Egyptians built in the third century BC, is one of the large pyramid structures that was built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "up" mark looks like a V, and the "down" mark looks like a bracket or a square with the bottom side missing.
Upward means that you have to start from the tip and close the bow, downward means that you have to start from the "frog" (that is the place where the hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a gentler sound, while a down-bow makes it stronger, more assertive.
Feel free to write your notes with a pencil, but remember that the printed symbols are there for musical reasons, therefore they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1786.
In a carriage, they went back to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and voiced threats against the king and queen.
The crowd urged the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a member of the royal guard, who was murdered in Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the majority of expenses, and interest on the bonds was transferred in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profit received from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main gain of US imperialism.
To understand the temples, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and after them came the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the promotion of technology or technological necessity to a specific idea that human destiny is determined by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in the field of technology.
The largest part of technological determinism interpretations are connected to two main ideas: that technological development is largely outside of cultural or political influence and that technology, in turn, "influences" society in a way that is inherent, not socially determined.
For example, one could say that cars definitely contribute to road development.
However, the state-scale road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce car owners' costs.
A massive number of cars also causes a larger number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the rehabilitation of those who have suffered injuries.
In Romanticism, there was a large element of cultural determinism, acquired from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time traditions and culture arose that were connected to this geography, which, being in harmony with the place in society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of our days, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its recognition as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status decreased during the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were much more valuable than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
At this moment, the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style reached its culmination in the period from the 10th-11th century to the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to slow communication in the countryside, styles in the west might be lagging behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest events of that time as a result of the Crusades – people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is practiced to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds that are in the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to increase yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this still occurs in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel left out and rejected by society's standards, and they allow developing a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of various factors.
Subculture members often indicate their affiliation by using a specific and symbolic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most widespread methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use some unfortunate cases where children who were left neglected due to misfortune or direct violence were not socialized while they grew up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been isolated by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child occurred because the parents did not accept the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Street children have likely experienced severe violence or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is claimed that some were raised by animals, but some are said to live in the wild all alone.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child behaves (within physical limits) almost identically to the specific animal caregiver, for example, being fearful or indifferent towards humans.
Even though project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the support system goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that provides support for individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of support, but so is the little Clippy from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is included in the software; it is designed to question, prompt, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster families for various reasons, ranging from neglect to violence and even exploitation.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We understand the foster family system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster families must provide all those things that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication elements.
The unique properties of the internet encourage the addition of new dimensions to the conditions of usage and satisfaction methods.
For example, "entertainment" and "socialization" are offered as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
When Eimejs and Makkorda (1998) researched auditor reactions to websites, they also identified "personal involvement" and "relationship continuation" as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It is especially asserted that, by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to determine whether a person is lying.
In his work "Presidential Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who are unable to understand the content of a speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such an ability to interpret human behavior may be common to animals, for example, dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection then removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle two variations forward and backward between two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive system like a human finds it difficult to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, if this is not done, there are serious consequences: suppressed growth, inadequate nutrition, and ultimately, death.
Easier to obtain plant resources would have been proteins, which are obtainable in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are thermally processed.
In contrast, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep fragmentation is characterized by frequent arousals or awakenings during one's normal sleep period followed by a relatively quick return to sleep (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm, so that you are aware of what is happening without fully waking up.
If you turn off the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Every person has the ability to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that prevents achieving this goal is our own stubbornness and negativism.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened by using yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany in World War II was a common enemy, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures caused the countries to disintegrate.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
This lasted the next 40 years, with empowered armies, it was fought from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland was already destroyed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize to the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete in just one night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after conquering the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the ocean.
The task of naval forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and supplies, while at the same time hindering your enemy's ability to move their people and supplies.
One of the most noteworthy and recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, Germany, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the allies had suffered failure, Germany might have been able to conquer Great Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them to easily access milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Traditionally, domestic goats were kept in large herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often looked after by goat herders, who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known sheep herders. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and haul larger loads than on much more uneven roads.
The foundation of the railway track was introduced very early to keep the rails in place. But gradually it was understood that the rails would be more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first exclusively iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of locomotion was walking, humans started walking upright around two million years ago, when Homo Erectus appeared (which means upright man).
Your predecessors, the australopithecines, usually didn't walk upright.
Bipedalism specialization is found in australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement and even be activists, in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it's like treating the symptoms. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological achievements, and the problems have become bigger because of overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption in Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks further to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, they were made for 150 to 200 kopecks, which are now known as "Danlapa one-pagers".
John Nixon performed the first public reading of the document on July 8th in the Independence Hall courtyard.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his army in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
Currently, the 25 known Dunlop leaflets are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and exists even today. We call them birds.
Many people don't perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Still, birds have many features that still seem like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all modern computers are based on manipulations with information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these are called binary digits or bits, using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious causes. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general, therefore it is impossible to diagnose the cause.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to find specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This term originates from an ancient association with bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to being human parasites.
Like a robber fly, so too is the bed bug a shameless species that adapts to living in its host's nest or dwelling.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have revealed that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
Some might decide that raising a child is not in their or the child's best interests.
Such couples may decide to create an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works, using the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
However, an experiment is not just one thing, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations, which also drives scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the Western world discovered that it was separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation using biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only a reaction to external periodic signals, are documented for the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue free cyclic movement, even if there are no external signals.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading arguments that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children; otherwise, mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of activities carried out in a specific location include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and research on the ecosystem.
Examples include travelling, photography, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people in cars leave the small rural towns to go to their workplaces, and others drive past them, whose destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport route, everyone is somehow connected and supports the transport system, which is based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In atheistic countries, you rarely hear similar level complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why does the transport system create such complaints, why does it not work daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more significant happening?
Traffic flow is the study of individual driver and vehicle movement between two points and their mutual interaction.
Traffic flow research is complicated, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to maintain a sufficiently consistent speed range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonably acceptable stability and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better depict the traffic flow, a connection is created with three main characteristics: (1) flow (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in road infrastructure planning, design, and operation.
Insects were the first animals to rise into the air. Their ability to fly helped them better avoid enemies and more effectively find food and partners.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many people thought the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and also other stars).
That seems logical, because you can't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places six miles wide.
The Amazon is also the widest river, in some places six miles wide.
Fully 20% of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued until the end of the Late Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of construction.
In the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were considerably more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legal acts and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language for those who work in government jobs, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholic.
People have known about such chemical elements as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in a natural way and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is made of a mixture that consists of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This more closely resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also proposed a theory that they transform into new materials, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that contain a small proportion of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Generally, everything is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore the pencil, when it was created, was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, since new writing methods have appeared, the status and ways of using pencils have been discarded as unnecessary.
People now write messages on computer screens, never feeling the need to approach an executioner.
One can only wonder what kind of keyboard will become the standard when something newer appears.
Nuclear reactors operate on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy wheel uphill. By splitting the nucleus again, part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to decay with little or even no external influence.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
On the near side, the crust is approximately 70 km thick and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
In the nearer side there could be more liquid seas because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Attraction theories aim to create an understanding of what repels or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that are internalized when they become adults.
These theories explore what makes specific people choose the things they want to do, and what things their environment makes them do or not do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a leader starts leading their former peers, two types of behavior can appear. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Leaders of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, conduct performance appraisals, delegate responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who believes that he has to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Such behavior often causes disagreements between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than standard team members, as their teams can meet together in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The actual presence of the "Invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The invisible team" is a management team to which each team member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why does the organization want to go through a time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? One of the organization's goals in implementing learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and innovation can manifest.
As a result, the process in which an organization works together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new, innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, the management must foster a culture of innovation, as well as participate in knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angels (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method that is used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the investigation of theoretical approach insights. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it a bit more precise.
Correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in various mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, it forms a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation mechanisms.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on solving real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military field, and they are also built into various home computers and video game applications.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Quite often, teachers gladly take their students to places that are impossible to visit by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while being with their class.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to rethink the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are saved online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Even though students usually start their blog with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author starts trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Writing blogs "makes students more aware of the world around them." The need to ensure the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper blog usage "can provide students with the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to internet materials, students can define their own position within the context of other writings, as well as summarize their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravecs, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, there are various art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north, the Muskoka region and other hidden natural beauty.
All these and other things highlight what foreign people consider the most essential thing about Canadians.
Large territories further to the north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a comparison of population size that surprises many: The US has more African Americans than Canada has inhabitants.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
To date, Madagascar is the largest separate continent when it comes to wilderness.
Most small islands are independent states or associated with France and known for their luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had great success in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The northern region is bordered by the Sahel, while the south and west are bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that every female traveler claims that she is single, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a chain (but not one that looks very valuable).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they would call harassment, and it's not unusual for someone to follow, grab their hand, and so on.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for your position (cultural differences or not - that doesn't mean it's acceptable!).
The city of Casablanca as we know it today was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port, which they called Anfa.
Portugal destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casablanca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Beida, and Spanish traders, who established trading bases there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, for example, tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole variety of small items, but it's all intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Goma is relatively safe, but any excursions outside of Goma should be investigated beforehand to ascertain the combat situation that continues in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base from which to climb the Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also one of the cheapest places in Africa for mountain gorilla trekking.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, remote lands.
Today's Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it an interesting place for tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1900, it was included in the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stopping points during the creation of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Africa's Great Civilizations".
The city is in great contrast to other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic, rather than African, atmosphere.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border in the east, the Zimbabwe border in the north, and the Crocodile River is the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports different species of wildlife.
This is one of the main tourist attractions of South Africa and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there is a daily conservation and entrance fee in the park.
It might be advantageous to acquire a Wild Card, which ensures entry to separately selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory the name Hong Kong, and it is the place where many tourists primarily focus.
The building parade, which forms the Hong Kong panorama, is compared to a sparkling bar graph, clearly reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon promenade, which is located opposite.
Most of Hong Kong's island city development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This place was taken over by British colonists as their own, and if you're asking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast into the territory of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove thickets - they contain some of the last remaining patches of mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans occupy an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife nature reserve; it is estimated that this area has 400 royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses arrive all day from the intercity bus station (across the river), the majority, especially those heading east and to Dhaka/Bumthang, arrive from 06:30 to 07:30.
As intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a couple of days in advance.
Small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable, serve most of the area.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, for example, Paro (From 150) and Punakha (From 200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapok River and connects the city of Oyapok in Brazil and the city of Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
Both towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long with two 3.5 meter wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational in 2017, when it is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group who inhabited Eastern Paraguay and lived partly as nomadic hunters who practiced subsistence agriculture.
In the Chaco region, other groups of indigenous peoples lived, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering natural resources, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as the "Province of the Giants of the Indies," emerged from the meeting of Spanish conquistadors with local indigenous groups.
Spain began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a large part of the character and identity of its indigenous population.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament takes place in December at the Las Canitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched at other times of the year.
To find out news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets, search for the "Argentina de Polo" association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which has the same value as one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in the village, which is located in Stenlija, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
In remote villages, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and US currency might be; contact the owners beforehand to specify the most suitable payment method.
Exchanging foreign currency outside the islands is almost impossible, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is located to the south of the Equator, therefore, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, the temperature is usually above +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold; the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates the feeling that it is colder than the thermometer shows.
There aren't specific "rainy" or "dry" periods: the amount of rain stays approximately the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild animals, and you shouldn't feed or disturb them.
According to the park administration's statement, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
Regardless of how docile they appear, beavers, elk, deer, bears and almost all other large animals can attack.
Every year, several tens of visitors are injured because they did not observe a suitable distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so don't get too close to them.
Also, keep in mind that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so avoid carrying or preparing smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of slightly less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a tragic division of the Slavic fleet took place in the port, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Peaceful gatherings in the city organised by the Mau movement during the independence struggle led to the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is surrounded by two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular are in three locations.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the area of the North Harbour) are in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where you can safely swim, and many shady pohutukawa trees provide shade.
Tamaki Drive beaches are in the Waitemata Harbour, in the high-class Mission Bay and St Heliers suburbs in central Auckland.
Those are sometimes overcrowded family beaches with a large selection of coastal shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines might have an easier time surviving the journey.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A small black coffee is an "espresso", cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but wonderful.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries are rare on the reef for this reason.
Follow the recommendations of government authorities, observe all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
North of the city, from October to April, jellyfish can be found on beaches and near river mouths. Sometimes they can also be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they very rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away quickly.
Saltwater crocodiles do not exclusively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in riverbeds north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that after arriving at their destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation services to and from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel deals.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or prepare other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
All bookings and requests must first be submitted to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most of the music festival participants decide to camp on site, and the majority of visitors consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may be over, there may be festival sections where music will be played until late at night.
In some festivals, there are special tent areas for families with small children.
When crossing the Baltics in winter, check the location of your skates, because when driving through the ice, it is most often the skates that create a terrible noise.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the space.
In some places at the event, alcoholic beverages are offered. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone preparing to travel in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is low, and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to get stuck can fall in a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow or condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic generally flows continuously throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in its popular meaning refers to traveling overland to observe the stunning African wildlife, especially the savanna.
Some animals, for example, elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment will allow good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will better see them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush safari", "hiking safari" or going "on foot") consists of a hike lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, because it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020, before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies differ, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies from the end of March do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that the majority of the event tickets will cost between 2500 and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost around 7000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels offer the possibility to rent an iron and ironing board, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron isn't available or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (this can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different water purification methods, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it's enough to boil water for one minute, in others, several minutes are needed.
Filter effectiveness varies, and if doubts arise, you might consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they do not know from their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case – cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are usually not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont creates the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often going through isolated forest territory.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, keep in mind that steep slopes, narrow shoulders and sharp turns dominate.
The speed limits in place are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is more important than usual.
Interestingly, mobile phone services are much stronger here than in many other sections of the route, e.g., Pennsylvania Wilds.
German confectionery products are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and diverse, similar to your southern neighbors in Austria.
Fruit confectionery is widespread, with apples being baked all year round, but cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German confectionery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich confectionery products, try those which, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on spices and herbs together with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a great diversity of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, when used without additional qualification, this term usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and it offers incredibly delicious food, the dominant flavors being Javanese-favored peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet, hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but can create concerns about safety, because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his foot is stuck in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if a falling rider is dragging it.
Cochamó Valley is Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a large granite wall and diverse rock formations.
Breathtaking views open from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes among its endless wall potential.
Mountain snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan all their holidays based on skiing in a specific place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers have been dated to 5000 years before our era!
Alpine skiing as a sport originated at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Skiing: this activity is also called ski tourism or ski touring.
This is related to alpinism or mountain climbing, but usually it doesn't include it; the latter is done in a steep environment, and requires stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski route similarly to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than walking – but only very rarely will you manage to reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
In this regard, the Schengen area functions as one country.
While you are staying in this zone, you can usually cross borders repeatedly without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas to each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money, and work with documents.
There is no universal definition of what exactly constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies consider items older than 100 years to be antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit in North America may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sami, and trade culture is also important for representatives of many other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami have been engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer mainly as working animals.
Nowadays, many Sami work in modern jobs. Tourism is a significant source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Even though it is widely used, especially among those who are not Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel warnings, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also take into account the advice of other countries' governments, not just your own, but they are intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Warnings are only a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The views offered are often superficial, general and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Hazardous weather is a general term that describes any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious disruptions of communication, or loss of human life.
Dangerous weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they have various forms that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, excessive amounts of precipitation, wildfires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, and waterspouts are forms and consequences of dangerous weather conditions.
Regionally and seasonally dangerous weather conditions are blizzards, snowstorms, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any dangerous weather risks that may affect their region, as these may affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Searching the internet for "Hostile environment courses" will likely display the address of a local business.
In courses, all the questions discussed here are usually examined in much more detail, supplemented with practical experience.
The courses usually last from 2 to 5 days and include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes also weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the desert are common, but publications about war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for the return trip.
The government wants to issue passports that don't indicate sex (X), or documents that have been renewed, so that they match the desired name and sex, separately.
Just as strongly, the will of foreign governments to observe these documents is different.
Screening at security checkpoints has also become much more intrusive in the era after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people should not have to expect that they will go through scanners with untouched privacy and dignity before surgery.
Backwash is the return flow of water from waves that break on the beach, often near a reef or similar.
Due to submarine topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid current towards the deep sea can form there.
The biggest part of death cases happen because of fatigue, trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim where you haven't been burned yet, or depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
Return shock comes sooner than culture shock (there's a smaller honeymoon phase), is longer and can be harder.
For travelers who easily adapt to a new culture, it is sometimes more difficult to readjust to their own native culture.
Having returned home from living abroad, you are accustomed to the new culture and have forgotten some customs of your native culture.
People were probably patient and understanding when you first traveled abroad, because they understood that travelers need to get used to the new country.
People might not think that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the silence before the show begins.
Usually, you can always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors here. The story of sound and light is almost like a storybook.
The Sphinx is the background and narrator of the long story.
Images are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases there - in 2020, sixteen are active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the still active volcano's flooded caldera provides an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region to the south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The subglacial mountains here merge with the plateau, then reappear again, forming the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or the Sentinel Range are located Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, whose peak is located at an altitude of 4892 m on Vinson Mountain.
In remote locations without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
Satellite phones usually don't replace mobile phones because to make a phone call you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite.
Shipping often uses the service, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
The local telephone service provider should have the ability to provide more information about establishing a connection with this service.
Arvi's popular solution for those planning a break is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, registering for gap year courses abroad can actually improve your chances of obtaining higher education in your home country.
Usually, in order to register for these educational programs, a tuition fee must be paid.
Finland is a good destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has many islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, a yacht is not really necessary.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are directly large enough for any yacht, using a smaller boat or even a kayak can provide a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven to eight people.
It's the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, otherwise this pastime is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands there is one boat for every 40 people).
The majority of the various Baltic cruises have a long stay planned in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with ship excursions, a separate visa will not be required (from 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and experience levels, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's no need to be ashamed of that: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things that are very common among people.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fears that are based on the unknown or a lack of control over the situation.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of goods. Often time is very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but other routes and smaller firms have a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, unloading and securing the goods on some routes could have taken several days.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as registered baggage. The airline's regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly business class is to pay a pile of money for that privilege (or, even better, arrange for your workplace to do it for you).
However, that's not cheap at all: you have to keep in mind that a business class ticket will cost up to four times more than a regular ticket, while a first-class ticket costs up to 11 times more!
Mostly, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know that there is a specific group of people who are willing to pay a lot of money for the priority of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, therefore they set appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, as a result of this conflict, the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic was created in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failures in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once it was the ancient city of Smyrna, now it is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Alongside the wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers, there are traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
From the village of Haldarsvík, there is a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and there is an unusual octagonal church there.
In the churchyard, above some of the graves, are interesting marble dove sculptures.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk through the intriguing village.
In the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron's vividly written story about its splendor.

Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a place of almost invaluable importance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still alive many men and women who survived here, and many others whose relatives – both Jews and non-Jews – were murdered or worked to death there.
Please treat this place with all due respect, seriousness, and regard. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface property by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak in Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only indicated in Catalan, because it is legally established as the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, impudent, and sophisticated.
Even though it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still to behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will significantly ease your trip.
The Parisian's stubborn pride will quickly disappear if you show a little, simple politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded, mostly with beeches, spruces and firs, and it has a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a very large diversity of plant communities, which is ensured by the diversity of its microclimate, different soils and different altitude levels.
The territory is also home to a great many animal and bird species.
Rare fauna can be found there, for example, the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, lynx, badger, wildcat, capercaillie, as well as many other widespread species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees, as well as cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries, women who arrive unprepared are provided with accommodation, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Likewise, men wear trousers that reach the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the storage at the entrance, but this garment is not washed after every user, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing these overalls. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in it.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available topping, for example, cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns next to the word "Sie" always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and prefixes.
This undoubtedly also eases reading, even though the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form slightly complicates writing.
In Italian, the pronunciation is relatively simple, because the majority of words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters from which to start are c and g, because their pronunciation differs depending on the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means dear, but carro means cart.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It's pointless to say that knowing a Romance language will make it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish might surprisingly conclude that Portuguese is close enough, therefore it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated nowadays and remain as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution wasn't such a problem in those days as it is nowadays, and they are usually found in cities or on campuses, they are easier to reach than those built in our time.
The largest part of our modern research telescopes are huge devices in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the emperor only for himself and other representatives of the emperor's court aristocracy.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so don't give in to the temptation to take even "just one" specimen.
If, while visiting an officially arranged garden, you collect "samples", you will be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is usually a very safe place to be, and it is very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost everything after arrival.
But, finding yourself in high tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also some buses that run north, to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take goes to Hebron, and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday theme.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting places on the Danube, or boating on the Erie Canal.

Many traditions associated with holidays have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night awake in some open place, to see the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has Christian theological explanations, but it may be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In more traditional churches, the Easter Vigil often takes place on Saturday evening of Easter week, and congregations often begin the celebrations at midnight to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on the islands came here swimming or flying.
The great distance from the continent prevented mammals from making the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you are visiting Arctic or Antarctic territories in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be more or less dark all day and night.
Since the territories are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last names or by job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is very important, emphasizing the efforts of the group, not praising individual achievements.
Employees often need their supervisor's approval for every decision they make, and they are expected to follow their supervisor's instructions without question.
