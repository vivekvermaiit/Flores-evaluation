This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread; furthermore, it also provides details not found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional distribution.
Scientists believe that the plumage of this animal was dark brown on top and carotenoid on the bottom.
The discovery also helps to understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur does not have a well-developed shaft or rachis, but does have other characteristics such as feathery and plumose barbs, the researchers concluded that it is likely that the rachis developed later than the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers suggest that, even if this is the plumage of a young dinosaur, the sample is of adult plumage and not that of a hatchling.
Scientists suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not that of a hatchling.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate the observations that were made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by the tidal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the earth, causing the tides, the Camino de Santiago exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a halo, and is composed of numerous particles.

In France, voting is generally an experience that involves little technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their preferences in an envelope.
After the electoral table verifies the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.

Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although the house was occupied by three people when the car crashed, they weren't injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the emergency services extricated the driver from the Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of killing her son.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness will be under suspicion due to the public dissemination of their image.
It is a common practice there in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have viewed publishing photos as something potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, emphasizes that "journalists may be taking a risk if they publicize photos and information of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, told reporters that no comment would be made, at least until the charges were presented.
The document, according to the leak, refers to the border dispute, which the Palestinians want to be established with the borders that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other issues discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands ten years of permanent military presence in the valley after signing the agreement, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control program were to be closely supervised by the guards, while the program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Together, the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc selected qualified volunteers from within the sporting shooters association's hunting program.
In agreement with Mick O'Flynn, interim Director of Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first cull had complete safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday at the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the provisional electoral council (CEP) as part of a set of measures aimed at leading the country to new elections.
The commission was the response that Martelly gave to the thousands of protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the inability to organize elections, some of which should have been held in 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that they had been sent 27 cases of accidents involving the devices.
A week ago, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report postponement "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:10 p.m. Friday GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office said there were no reports of damage in the nation.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat.
A former Philippine police officer held several Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several people held captive were rescued, and there are at least six confirmed victims.
Six hostages were released, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an old woman while she went to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynaecologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he was working at Liggins Hospital, he began researching premature birth in his free time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, fetal lung maturation could be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Her fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Very unique like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as weird as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic have increased by eight percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic with the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the people in the survey share this point of view, wanting Elizabeth II of England to be the last monarch of Australia.
As extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those consulted believe that Australia should be a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never be one.
The Olympic gold medalist was going to swim in the 100 and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is in doubt.
He couldn't take the necessary medicines to overcome the pain because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery with different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of bringing water to Earth along with organic material that could form proteins that support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term at the beginning of this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says would allow aircraft to make shorter flights, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the old technology based on terrestrial radar technology. This aims to allow air traffic controllers to establish the position of aircraft more precisely and give pilots more accurate information.
There is no special transport, and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and surface parking and short-stay parking are not available.
The fear of lack of transportation opened the possibility that the match would be played behind closed doors without the presence of the teams' fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer, due to breeding between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be given many forms. It can be rolled into fine shapes.
It can be made into fine wire, to handle and braid it. It can be forged or made into sheets with it.
It can be made very thin and inlaid into another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the miniatures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two kinds of dry powder and then, with clean and wet hands, press it into a ball shape.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers. You'll feel something strange as a kind of crust forms.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in practically every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere alters some of the light and vision.
It is necessary to have a rocket 100 feet tall to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the invention did for us was to provide us with easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car, and many other transports brought us.
Below them are mid-sized felines that eat mid-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including common cats) that eat smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to success is the concept of niche, a special job that each of the cats has and that prevents them from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three related males along with up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually related to each other, forming a large family of daughters and sisters.
Lion prides function similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are very similar to lions (although not to other big cats) in their behavior and are also very damaging to their prey.
The tiger is a complete athlete: it can climb (although not very well), swim, jump good distances, and exert five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the lion's powerful roar; it's like a phrase of hoarse words shouted.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt and find animals to eat by smell, sniffing their tracks on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move very slowly. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the original population (if they go to live in the mountains or the river, or move to an island, from which they cannot easily return), they usually find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they were before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapted to its new environment, they started to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence that is very important for evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, that they expel).
Plants make their food by photosynthesizing the sun. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its large jaws have more than 70 teeth, sharp as knives, with an extra set on the roof of its mouth, which means there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We're not entirely certain, but it could have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
It would attack anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex was a match for it.
While most of their food would seem familiar to us, the Romans had a good portion of strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women eat food sitting in chairs, rich men feast together where they will be lying on their side while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa. And no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's house.
The people made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests strived to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and in it an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Sometimes special towers with a pyramid shape, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The highest point of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Much of the Hebrew family's life was outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were counters that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, came across Greenland and named it so.
But without taking this discovery into account, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each of the countries is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning, the parchment (of 29.75 by 24.50 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Then, it seems likely that the notation was only added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, which were the French who became allies of the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American forces and the Free French Forces liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a representative group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which, in some way, defines the greatness of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilizational culture implies passing on knowledge across many generations, a cultural footprint that is maintained, and a significant spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving historically relevant traces and are not properly recognized as civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government – with Congress as the only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress had no power to levy taxes, and as there was no national executive or judicial power, it depended on the state authorities, who were not usually cooperative, to approve all laws.
Nor did he have the authority to annul fiscal legislation or tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little into account that representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and was the world champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, and there are Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world.
Due to the grouping of islands that the country has, Japan is, in geographical terms, an archipelago.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1627, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the grain production practices of the aborigines and employing Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan; they declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a more reliable idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the era of analog films.
It is still produced today, but most importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format, paradoxically, has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by 12 to get the ratio of the simplest whole number) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (from the APS family, for example) have an equal or very similar ratio.
The rule of thirds, so overused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
He claims that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and gained power, was subjected to scrutiny.
The Christian religion had united different European states for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and culture.
His overwhelming power affects all strata of society, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church exist precisely for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led to questioning whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the mooring began, Great Britain initiated the naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law ratified by several international agreements of the previous two centuries.
The United Kingdom laid mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was poor, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the most widespread attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of war in the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States of America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the boss at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known period of these is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat of the great palace of Xi'an.
It resulted in many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to its people and not to a single leader.
Furthermore, with the Revolution, positions were opened to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and wealthy to succeed.
The same thing happens with the army because instead of basing military classifications on class, they are currently based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to go to a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca is this cave, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even knowing of its existence. Once inside the cave, you are in total isolation.
You can't see anything more than the beautiful, clear sky and the mountains that surround it. Few things of this world enter this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramidal constructions made in remembrance of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis," located in the Egyptian valley of the dead, includes several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to pay homage to the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples to pay homage to his wives and relatives.
The "bow up" indication looks like a V, and the "bow down" indication like a staple or a small square without the bottom line.
Upwards means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and downwards means you have to start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up bow generates a softer sound, while a down bow is stronger and more assertive.
You can take notes, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons and must be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (eleven-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Elisabeth of France, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of working market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people yelling and shouting threats at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open wide the windows of their carriage.
Suddenly, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard murdered in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the United States imperialism in the Philippine War were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States of America to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds advanced in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, here's the translation of the Asturian sentence: From the beginning, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos were the main gains of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events unfold is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses, in practice, a rich set of ideas, ranging from technological impetus or technological imperative to a strict sense in which human destiny is dominated by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology in itself follows a path largely removed from political or cultural influence, and that technology, for its part, has effects on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily encourages the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable with only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The possession of a large number of cars also leads to a greater number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair the damaged bodies.
Romanticism had much to do with cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time habits and cultures emerged linked to this geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is seen as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
His status declined in the 12th century, especially because the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was then that the title of Fashion Capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style emerged in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing in the east was very influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could be 25 or 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing, as a result of the crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is that which is done to have enough production to cover the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and usually ecological system that uses seeds from the ecoregion along with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers developed subsistence agriculture and this is what happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together similar individuals who feel a rejection of society's standards and help them develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic of the age, ethnicity, class, place, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine that a culture is distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
The members of a subculture usually show their belonging through the use of a distinct and symbolic style, which includes fashions, gestures, and slang.
One of the most common methods to show the importance of socialization is to point out the few and unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, bad luck, or premeditated abuse, were not socialized with adults while growing up.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some were confined (usually by their own parents and more); in some cases, this abandonment of children is due to the parents' rejection in the face of a severe physical or mental disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
It is supposed that some were raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When completely raised by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support that aids individuals who are going through a learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the Microsoft Office Clippy.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and aims to question, remind, and explain the procedures that may have been difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children go into foster care for many reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should thrive in an environment lacking care, education, and affection, but they do.
We believe that the Foster Care service is a safe environment for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education, and quality healthcare.
It is assumed that foster homes provide all the resources that were lacking in the home they were taken from.
The internet combines elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The peculiarities of the Internet encourage additional dimensions regarding the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, "to learn" and "to socialize" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and ongoing relationships were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their research on public reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is ensured that no one can detect if someone is lying through the correct interpretation of micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, indicated that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are, on the other hand, capable of evaluating sincerity with precision.
He even goes so far as to suggest that these abilities when it comes to interpreting human behavior might be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
The investigations of the twentieth century showed that there are two genetic reserves: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination generate variation between two gene pools in each generation.
There on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to be able to satisfy its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Furthermore, not doing so has serious consequences: it increases depression, leads to poor nutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest plant resources to find would be proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides proteins that contain essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep inertia is the process of voluntarily waking up during your usual sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a not-too-loud alarm that disturbs you without fully waking you up.
If you find that you're turning off the alarm while you're asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a famous diuretic) before sleeping, forcing oneself to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension they have in their body and spirit.
The less tension there is, the more positive the vital energy is. Each person has the capacity to achieve complete peace and joy.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that can prevent us from it is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with many techniques of Indian yoga.
At first, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is composed of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love and acceptance.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and conscious illumination is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which led the USSR and the United States of America to cooperate. After the war ended, the clashes between their systems, processes, and cultures led to the estrangement of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies and the Cold War began.
It was going to last the next 40 years and was going to be truly fought by subsidiary armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken, the only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, after more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transportation of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The armed forces are responsible for ensuring that your country maintains its ability to move citizens and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable nearby examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The United States was trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have conquered Great Britain and the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hide.
Domestic goats used to be kept in herds that roamed the mountains or other grazing areas, and were tended by goatherds, who were usually children or young people, in a similar way to the more well-known shepherds. These methods of care are still used today.
The first tracks were built in England in the 16th century.
Although wagonways were no more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to gain more speed and haul larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
The sleepers were introduced early on to support the tracks. Little by little, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a normal practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known form of transportation is walking. Humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Australopithecus, their predecessors, didn't walk upright so often.
Bipedal specialization has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked upright as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the ecological movement, and we can be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
It's like a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we'll need to find the root of the problems, and we'll have to deactivate it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the advances in science and technology of humanity; the problems only continue to grow due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the nearby printing press of John Dunlap.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on June 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 photos that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
There are many who don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
Although there are many things in birds that are reminiscent of dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs with spurs, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers today handle information encoded in binary system.
A binary number can only have two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits – or bits, using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general to make an early diagnosis.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medications or household chemicals.
Read the label to obtain specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bichu" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from the old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bedbugs and kissing bugs make nests, adapting to live in the nest or house of their host.
In the United States of America, there are around 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not what suits them best or what is best for them.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents lose their parental rights so that another couple can have them over the child.
The primary objective of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
However, it's not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to discard one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and observations and guiding scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions were accepted in all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed that rhythms in psychology and behavior depend greatly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their manifestation in internal clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, are documented in the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue in a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was conclusive in determining that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, some viruses, to introduce their DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, carefully labeling the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on the type, the importance of the fragment of genetic material, and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells have genetic transmission, although other types of mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the plants and fauna.
Some examples of activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks to study information about their ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and cross paths with people who work in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport launch, everyone is connected and supports a transport system based on the private car.
Science now indicates that this intensive coal economy has displaced the biosphere from one of the stable states that facilitated human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses means of transport. Almost everyone complains about these means of transport.
In developed countries, one almost never finds the same level of complaint about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints? Why do they do it daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Luckily, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably uniform manner; therefore, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be represented, approximately, mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and carry out the construction of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and reproduce in a suitable way.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a greater number of small places.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems to be what the senses perceive, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the flow of the second river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world because in some places it reaches 6 miles.
20 percent of the water that reaches the oceans from the planet's rivers does so from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gets water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or technical excellence of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which already at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and communication.
Italian is the usual language of most state workers, while Latin is also used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
Some basic chemical elements like gold, silver, or copper have been known since antiquity, and all of them can be found in nature in native metal form, being easy to extract using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, had the theory that all things are made of mixtures of one or more elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles, atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, with its invention, the pencil facilitated the lives of many people.
Sadly, with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil is relegated to a lesser status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to touch a typewriter.
One can only wonder what will happen to the Asturian language when something new appears.
A fission bomb uses the principle that energy is required to join a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no encouragement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is around 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner in the seas and larger in the highlands.
Perhaps there were more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have several needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what it is in certain people that makes them want the things they want, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs or Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors arise when managers start to direct their former colleagues. One extreme is to continue being "one of them."
This type of boss has a hard time making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning positions, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one mutates and becomes an unknown individual who believes that everything the team has done should be changed and made their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior usually causes rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups have the same standards of excellence as conventional ones, but there are slight differences.
The members of the virtual team usually function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than conventional team members since they can meet according to different time zones, something that may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for its members.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization? One of the methods for introducing learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome an obstacle on the part of an organization can encourage a new, innovative process that is available to the needs of the client.
Before the organization can innovate, leadership must generate a culture of innovation and common knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous perspective as a method used for organizations to reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data shows physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, the area of research narrows and becomes much more exact.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for some time that brain damage of various types, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect our behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that had never been seen before.
That gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI sounds like something out of science fiction, it is a very important part of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in Artificial Intelligence allows machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voices and faces.
These themes have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The AI system is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and has been built into many personal computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any class. Usually, the teacher would like to take the students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology provides a solution with virtual tours. Students can see museum objects, visit an aquarium, or engage with works of art while in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion is also a very good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website of their trip to Ciudad Capital; they remodel the previous one, but keep the versions so that they serve as a template.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students start blogging with careless grammar and spelling, audience pressure usually changes this.
As students tend to be the most critical audience, the blog writer strives to improve their writing to avoid those criticisms.
Participating in a blog also "makes students achieve greater knowledge of the world around them." The need to fuel the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is an activity that encourages collaboration and motivates students to learn outside of schools as well.
The good use of blogs "motivates students to critical analysis; with active exposure to online content, students define their opinions with the texts of other people and form their position on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the Canadian capital of charm and bilingualism, with a multitude of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka area and beyond.
All that and more makes Ontario the Canadian staple for foreigners.
There are large areas in the north with low population, some are practically uninhabited wildlands.
To make a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The eastern islands of Africa are in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself when it comes to animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts and beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, with a special focus on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that women say they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It helps a lot to wear a ring (although not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment, and it's not uncommon for us to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it's not admissible).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a string of trinkets, all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the easternmost part, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, to make any visits outside of Goma it is necessary to be informed about the state of the fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as one of the cheapest places in all of Africa to take excursions to see mountain gorillas.
You can take a boda-boda (mototaxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic and faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an improvised city, although its reputation makes it a tourist city. It has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage monuments in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops for Henry Louis Gates in the special "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city has a clear contrast with the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab than African feel.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a different type of life.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Regarding South Africa's national parks, they have conservation fees and park entrance fees.
It can be good to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the place that many tourists see as the main attraction.
The row of buildings that makes up Hong Kong's urban landscape has been compared to a bright bar graph, aided by the presence of the water of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront, which is right opposite.
The great majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is located on land reclaimed from the sea along the north coast.
This is the place that British settlers seized as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, reaching 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian inland territories.
The Sundarbans was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The area of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not of the mangrove type, but preserve remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plains.
The Sundarbans stretch over an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third corresponds to aquatic or swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been an animal sanctuary; currently there are about 400 Bengal tigers and about 40,000 chital deer in the area.
The buses leave from the intermodal station (on the other side of the river) during the day, perhaps most of them, especially those going east or to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses between districts are usually full, it is recommended to buy the ticket days in advance.
The small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy, reach most of the districts.
Shared taxis are fast and convenient means to go to nearby areas such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is estimated that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, the date by which the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani people were the most important indigenous group living in what is today eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, known as "the giant province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the colonial period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest annual competition is held in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
Here you can see more modest tournaments or matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), a value equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
The money can only be exchanged at the islands' bank, in the town of Stanley (opposite the FIC West store).
Pound sterling is generally accepted in the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted in Stanley.
In remote islands, it's easy for credit cards not to be accepted, although British or United States currency is. Check with the owners in advance to find out what method of payment is accepted.
It is practically impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures above 30ºC are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combined air and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There isn't a specific "rainy" or "dry" season: the rain remains practically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the animals are wild and should not be disturbed or fed.
According to park authorities, a distance of at least 100 yards/meters must be maintained from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
However docile they may seem, bison, formerly elk, bears and other large animals can attack you.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so you have to respect their space.
Keep in mind that smells attract bears and other types of animals; it's best to avoid bringing food or cooking smelly dishes and leave the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the scene of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven German, British, and United States ships refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three zones.
The beaches of the north coast (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean; they run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are safe sandy beaches and most have areas with pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are usually beaches full of families with a variety of shops on the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One", which isn't complex but pleasant and fresh. The other local beer is "Manta".
There are many kinds of French wine to taste, but the ones from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The tap water in this area is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A single coffee is an "espresso", cappuccino comes with cream to the top (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is on par with the Belgians. The juice is expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the coral reef throughout the year, and injuries from these causes there are rare.
However, follow the recommendations, respect the signs, and be alert to safety measures.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and rivers from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of these dates.
Sharks exist, however, it is rare for them to attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and leave if they see them.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live entirely in the sea. Their primary habitat is the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Making a reservation in advance gives the traveler peace of mind and ensures a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible that you can find other ways to stay, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any change or request must be handled with the travel agency first, not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most attendees decide to camp, and for many it's an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the stages you have to go early to camp near the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music ends on the main stages, there will be sections of the festival that will continue playing music until very late at night.
Some festivals have camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check where your cabin is: if you're sailing through ice, there's a lot of noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers generally don't need a visa (check the terms).
Casinos strive to maximize the time and money that customers spend. There are usually no windows or clocks and the exits are difficult to find.
They generally have special food, drinks and entertainment offers to keep guests in good spirits and keep them on the premises.
Some houses offer free alcoholic beverages. However, being drunk is being out of your mind, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone who is going to drive in high latitudes or in mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, the grip is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall to block you in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blizzards, or by the condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic flows without interruption all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a meaningful experience for visitors.
The term "safari", in popular use, is used to refer to overland trips to observe the beautiful African fauna, especially that of the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, often approach the cars, and the standard equipment allows for good views.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be cowardly, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or "going on foot") consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having already hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before it was postponed, you may be in a complicated situation.
Policies vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus cancellations do not cover July 2020, the dates of the Games.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average price of ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron or if you don't like having to iron even your socks, you can try using a dryer (if you have one).
Be careful that the fabrics do not reach high temperatures (which can cause them to shrink or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are different ways to filter water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is enough, in others, several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you had a boil water advisory, you should consider buying bottled water from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not accustomed to in their countries of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not generally considered pests.
Shopping in duty-free stores is the way to buy goods exempt from direct and indirect taxes in certain places.
Travelers who go to countries with high taxes can save a good amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated terrain and forests.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, you have to be careful: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves abound.
The speed limits on the signs are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections—usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h)—and it is very important to stay within them.
Oddly, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apple as an ingredient year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes usually pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to try delicious bollinos, try the ones that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is generally used with curry; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is the term that encompasses the enormous variety of regional cuisines of the country.
However, if no more adjectives are used, the term refers to the food originally from the center and east of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a wealth of simple dishes. The predominant flavors are peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on each side of the saddle.
They give more stability to the rider but can compromise their safety due to the risk of their feet getting caught.
If a rider falls from a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, they can end up being dragged if the horse runs. To reduce this risk, some safety precautions must be taken.
