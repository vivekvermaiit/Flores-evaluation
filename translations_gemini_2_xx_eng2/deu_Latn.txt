This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side and light or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central stalk called a rachis, but possess other features of feathers—barbs and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not chick fluff.
A car bomb detonated in the police headquarters of Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty other people.
According to the governor's office, nineteen of the injured are police officers.
The police said they suspect a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) is behind the attack.
They discovered that the Sun works based on the same fundamental principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
To determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow, luminosity and rotation are considered together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic field reversals.

The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes the tides, so too does the Milky Way exert gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory posits that the majority of dark matter resides in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "extremely worrying and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the pathogen in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital medical staff.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of XDR-TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis is apparently still small; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people who are infected in South Africa at any given time.

"Their thermal behavior isn't as uniform as that of large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper, on which their candidate of choice is listed, into an envelope.
After the officers have confirmed the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter register.
The French electoral law establishes a fairly strict procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes present at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes are inserted except those of properly counted and authorized voters.
The candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Four female skiers using outriggers did not finish, and 45 of the total 117 female skiers in the giant slalom were unable to place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and secured her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained significant head injuries.
The road where the accident had occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has meanwhile been charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but eyewitness accounts may be distorted, as her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office, which leads criminal prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians are demanding a return of the borders to the pre-Six-Day War state of 1967.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The shooters involved in the accompanying plague suppression trial should be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was being monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests critical of the regime that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods have been reported. In total, this has caused six fires and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of over 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry reacted by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and there are at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
The photographers took an elderly lady's seat while she went to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as crazy as I am... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents stated that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as three medley relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his numerous complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain because it is banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous individuals confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Because comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists hope for insights into how planets, especially Earth, are formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political drivel and nonsense."
There is speculation that he might run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while also reducing carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transportation provided, and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley. No parking or park-and-ride facilities are available on site.
As concerns about a lack of transport options grew, so did the likelihood that the match would have to be played behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although it was previously thought that this process would take much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a wide variety of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images, called illuminated manuscripts, in books.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then use clean, wet hands to form them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
If you're calling someone who is thousands of miles away, then you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was carried into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view somewhat.
It takes a gigantic rocket, taller than 100 feet, to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest service the wheel has given us is much simpler and faster transportation.
It brought us the railway, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are also many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special task that each cat has, ensuring they don't compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides operate similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions in behavior (but not other big cats) and are just as deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger doesn't sound like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence made of growling, roared words.
Ocelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and locate animals to eat (prey). They sniff for where the animals have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by visually blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population it originated from (e.g., if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they resettle on a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations then look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, breathe out).
Plants produce their food through photosynthesis using the sun. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothing from plants. We mainly nourish ourselves with plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, thus it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
He would attack anything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for him.
While the majority of their diet may seem familiar to us, the Romans certainly had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs. In contrast, rich men preferred to hold communal banquets where they reclined while eating their meals.
Dishes from ancient Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was regarded as the god's house.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were erected as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
The greater part of the Hebrew family's life took place in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard. Shops simply consisted of counters open to the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Old Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. As he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not true, though. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4th July 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
So, it is possible that the note was simply added as an identifier.
The D-Day landing and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
He was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the conquerors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and adequate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states, based on the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government that consisted only of the Congress.
The Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the authorities of the states, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
Furthermore, he had no authority to invalidate tax laws and customs duties between federal states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh-largest island country in the world.
Due to its cluster/group of islands, Japan is geographically often referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, thereby initiating a change in the grain cultivation methods of the indigenous people and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty's forces (1644-1912) take control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions, and in 1885, Taiwan is declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu mainly consists of three structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widespread still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its image format was adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strictly speaking, the so-called 35mm format confusingly measures 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have the exact same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It states that the intersection point of the lines that divide an image vertically and horizontally into thirds is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was being put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together, despite their different languages and customs.
His omnipotence controlled everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the important Christian tenets states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the churches' funds exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being upheld.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective as it cut the country off from vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different eras. Each period in China and each family that was in power was its own dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties, there were also unstable periods of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times, bitter wars raged among many nobles vying for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applied to the military, as army ranks were now based on caliber rather than class affiliation.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has endured through the ages and offers a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, she is not at all easy to find, even if you know she exists. Once you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
You see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to venerate deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead encompasses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The "smear" symbol looks like a V, and the "streak" symbol looks like a parenthesis or a square with the bottom line missing.
Upbow means you should start at the tip and push the bow. Downbow means you should start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Up-bowing typically generates a softer sound, while down-bowing is more powerful and expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; however, please remember that the printed bowing markings are there for musical reasons and should normally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789, in Versailles to return to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who hurled threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the enraged mob brandished the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the horrified Queen's eyes.
The war expenses of the US imperialists during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of the expenses, and interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits stemming from the ongoing exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the fundamental profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the order's founding.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an age in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general notions. Firstly, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and secondly, that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
One could argue that the automobile inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures arose in relation to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
His status declined over the course of the twelfth century, mainly due to the crusaders returning with gifts such as silk and spices that were considered more valuable than what the Byzantine markets had to offer.
Around this time, the title of world's fashion capital also migrated from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
Initially, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, Western styles lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic method of cultivation that uses saved, locally sourced seeds from the ecoregion and combines them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differentiate themselves from others based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style, encompassing fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child's neglect was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations.
Feral children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If raised completely by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of its physical capabilities) that are almost entirely consistent with those of its specific caregiver animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning aims to make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that assists individuals in a novel learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little Clippy paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is integrated into the software and is designed to question, suggest, and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to coercion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, loving, and educationally focused, but many are.
For us, the foster care system is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster home should meet all the needs they weren't getting in the home they were taken from.
The internet connects elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions with regard to the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who can no longer understand language due to brain damage can still accurately assess the honesty of others.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variations, and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Out in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Furthermore, there are serious consequences if you fail to do it: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep periods and falling back asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you're someone who snoozes the alarm in their sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another possibility based on biorhythms is to drink a lot of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea known for its diuretic effect) so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the available life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded to include the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga awakens Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation lies Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras opened, and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, the clash of systems, trajectories, and cultures led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was expected to last for the next 40 years and, in reality, would be fought through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed, and the only hope lay in a retreat and regrouping along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost overnight obsolete when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army penetrated the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient method for transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of a navy was to ensure that a country remains capable of transporting people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to transport personnel and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pasture areas. The goats were looked after by goat herders, very similar to the more well-known sheep herders; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing practices are still used today.
Even in the 16th century, mine railways were built in England.
Although the mine rails consisted merely of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to achieve higher speeds and haul larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Quite early on, sleepers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, the realization emerged that rails carrying a strip of iron were more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "Upright Man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
That's often just like treating the symptoms. However, if you want more than just temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed a great deal due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles have become more serious.
Following its approval by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known today as "Dunlap broadsides."
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap Broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, many things about birds still look like they came from a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of poisoning by ingestion may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the age-old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adept at parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their own best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can opt for an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to assume parenthood.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works by using the scientific method. This method is, in fact, the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it's not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and carrying out observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, paying particular attention to the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often substantially based on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclically determined behaviors, which are not just reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that execute free-running cycles for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the cells involved are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to drive to their jobs, and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic commuting system, everyone is, in some way, connected to and supports a transportation system based on the private car.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has driven the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave somewhat consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist with the planning, design, and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider selection of small shelters where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system's movements.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, as it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the largest river in the world by water volume. It carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans via the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were already a good thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work in the state, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to humankind since antiquity because they can all be found in their native form in nature and extracted using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more closely to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe in its entirety is composed of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Consequently, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, with the rise of newer writing methods, the pencil has faded into the background, resulting in a decline in its status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can be curious to see what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Roughly like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. If the nucleus is split again, some of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they decay even with little or no external influence.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Substantive theories focus on identifying what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want to do the exact things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, conduct performance reviews, assign responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and appropriates everything.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to discord between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed according to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which local management may not take into account.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of implementing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Ultimately, the collaborative work of an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process to address customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it significantly more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injuries, and tumors, influence behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
Newly emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head.
While AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI encompasses the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include controlling, creating strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-world problems.
Today, AI systems are frequently used in fields like business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and they have also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important component for every school class. It's not uncommon for a teacher to want to take her students to places where a bus ride isn't feasible.
Virtual excursions represent a technological solution. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is rebuilt each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author takes pains to improve their writing style in order to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also 'forces students to learn more about the world around them.' The need to pique the audience's interest inspires students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and present their own perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, characterized by a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, the unspoiled beauty of nature unfolds in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as what is seen by outsiders as typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of its wildlife, practically its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider assault and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay consistent when you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences aside; that certainly doesn't mean it's okay!).
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida, and it was called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of knick-knacks, but it's all just for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the status of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Although Timbuktu has a reputation as a tourist attraction and possesses an airport, it is nowadays an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops on Louis Gates' PBS special, "Wonders of the African World."
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arabic than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports different wildlife.
He is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park levies daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the Hong Kong territory and is the focus for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a dazzling bar graph, made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists adopted as their own. If you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km inland from the Bangladeshi and Indian coastlines.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest that lies within Indian territory is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also encompass some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that they are now home to 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6:30 am and 7:30 am.
As buses between districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017. The Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed by then.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of the West Indies, originated in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for its polo team and players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December on the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
You can find information about competitions and points of sale for polo game tickets at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is fixed in line with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and by Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the remote islands, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to see which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. Temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct wet or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, visitors must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, elk, moose, bears, and practically all large animals may seem, they can still attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them plenty of space.
Also, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife. Therefore, avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of an ignominious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland stretches across two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most offer shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family-friendly beaches, which are sometimes crowded, with a lovely shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might be easier to tolerate.
The local tap water is safe to drink without hesitation, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water as well.
For Australians, the idea of the coffee "Flat White" is foreign. A small black coffee is an "Espresso," a cappuccino is topped high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs, and especially heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. They can occasionally occur outside of this period as well.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the open ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the certainty that they will have a place to stay after arriving at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you might also be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also put your reservation on hold if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visas).
However, any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Bear in mind that music will continue to be played in some areas of the festival late into the night, even after the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as icebreaking creates a pretty terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a great effort to keep guests on the premises for as long as possible and encourage them to spend a lot of money. As a rule, there are neither windows nor clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special selection of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and ensure they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice, and below-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is low, and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In common usage, the term safari refers to a land journey to observe the magnificent African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and the standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often shy, and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but from the end of March, most cancellation policies did not apply due to the coronavirus until July 2020, for which the Olympic Games were planned.
It is assumed that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average ticket costing approximately ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels lend out irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If an iron isn't available or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric doesn't get too hot (this can shrink it or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various methods for purifying water. Some of these prove to be more effective in counteracting specific hazards.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritations, or, in the worst case, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people, are not usually classified as vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from duties and excise taxes in specific locations.
Travelers whose destination country has high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway between Point Marion and Fairmount is arguably the greatest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow lanes and sharp curves are prevalent here.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, the cell service here is much better than in many other areas along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite delicious. In Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, as they are in neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruit pastries are widespread, with apples being cooked into pastries year-round, and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts, or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, then try what is known, depending on the region, as a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when the term is used without further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes. Javanese people prefer peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut palm sugar), and a number of aromatic spices as flavor enhancers.
Stirrups are aids for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet could potentially get caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse bolts. A number of safety precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to fall away from the saddle when pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The summits offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities for this.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular activities where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and ride down a slope over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport date back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski touring with a backpack: This activity is also called ski mountaineering or ski touring.
It resembles alpine ski touring or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include them, as the latter are carried out in steep terrain and require much sturdier skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover somewhat greater distances than when hiking – you'll only very rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through several passport controls if you wanted to travel through multiple countries.
However, the Schengen area functions a bit like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa individually for each of the Schengen member countries, which saves time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of which manufactured objects qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition exhibits geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in regions like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be considered "antique" even if they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also significant for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi raised reindeer on a large scale; instead, they lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities. They mainly kept reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Even though the term "Zigeuner" is primarily used by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If a travel warning is issued for the country you are planning to visit, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than your own. However, their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather events can occur anywhere in the world, and there are various types of these events, depending on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any type of inclement weather affecting their area, as this may impact all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
An internet search for "hostile environment course" will likely show the address of a local company.
A course typically covers all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on wilderness survival, but few publications on war zones.
Travelers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid identification documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies greatly.
Moreover, searches at security checkpoints have become far more intrusive in the time after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people prior to surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when going through scanners.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves broken on the beach, often found near reefs or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow concentrates in a few deeper areas, and a rapid current extending to deep water can form there.
Most fatalities occur due to exhaustion when trying to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back isn't harder than normal.
Try to get somewhere you won't be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you were noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock hits sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is less pronounced), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their culture of origin.
When you return home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and shed some of the behaviors of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need time to adjust to a new country.
One might not expect that patience and understanding are also required towards returning travelers.
The Sound and Light Show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is quiet, before the show begins.
Normally, you constantly hear the noises of tourists and vendors. The story of the sounds and the light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations; in 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Further islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the peninsula's mountains transition into a plateau, then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak, at 4892 m high, is Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to a satellite in order to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that require data and voice telecommunications.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
Study and course offerings abroad are an increasingly popular option for people planning to take a gap year.
This is especially popular with high school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting a higher education in your home country.
Usually, a tuition fee is charged for registration in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland; one in six or eight people owns a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several full days, while returning in the evenings to sleep on the ship.
If you only go ashore as part of the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There's no need to be ashamed of it: it's nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and the processes involved during a flight can help some people overcome the fear associated with the unknown or the feeling of being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Often, time is a very important factor with company documents, commercial goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies, difficulties arose.
If they shipped things via air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow sending baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a hefty sum for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to foot the bill).
However, that's not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it's pointless to even look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there's a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving at their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were able to be restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive, and bustling commercial center located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings, and modern shopping centers are characterized by classic red tile roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city exudes more of an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some of the graves.
It's worth taking a half-hour stroll through the fascinating village.
To the north and in the immediate vicinity lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendor in glowing colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly via Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Also, in the north, visit the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage site) – a place world-renowned for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave as well as a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered there or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by applying or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the primary official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely spoken in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even if this is often just an inaccurate cliché, you'll find it easiest to get around in Paris if you put your best foot forward and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make getting along considerably easier.
The brusque exterior of Parisians quickly disappears if you show basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, diverse soils, and varying altitudes, it boasts a remarkably large variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
There, you can find rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and capercaillies, as well as many more commonly occurring species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach below the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do have wrap-around skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear pants that reach past the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothing is not washed after every user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. There is a one-size-fits-all option for all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and whatever ingredients are readily available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns are always capitalized, in addition to the word "Sie" for "you," even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It probably makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used as a noun.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure you pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means "dear," whereas "carro" means "chariot."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand formulations better.
If you speak a Romance language, it is naturally easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not the problem during their heyday that it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses, which are easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the Emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility in the vicinity of the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formal garden and collect "samples," you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where it's easy to get around and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
Being located in the extreme tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to be prepared for both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for planning a vacation.
For example, visits to castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Eire Canal.
They also represent popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been adopted worldwide by both believers and non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There's a tradition of spending Easter Vigil awake at some open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with congregational celebrations often beginning around midnight, celebrating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or being washed ashore.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the regions are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with the focus being more on group performance than on praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees must obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their bosses' instructions unconditionally.
