"We have four-month-old mice that were previously diabetic and are now no longer so," he added.
The study is still in its early stages, as cautiously stated by Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and director of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association.
Like other experts, he is skeptical about the possibility of curing diabetes, pointing out that these results are not relevant for those already affected by type 1 diabetes.

Siminoff appeared on the commercial television channel QVC in late 2017.
Ring also reached a settlement agreement with the competing security services company, ADT Corporation.
While there appears to be an experimental vaccine capable of reducing mortality from Ebola, on the other hand, no drug has yet been found that has clearly proven suitable for treating existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies revealed it was less effective than hoped in preventing deaths.
In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a reference and compared it to the other three therapies.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic community to work towards creating a safe environment for all of its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC stated, which is that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by pursuing significant change within our organization, and not through decertification.
USA Gymnastics has commissioned an independent investigation to understand how abuse of the scale described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have remained hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive, and empowered environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski was an advisor to John F. Kennedy and subsequently to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely accepted theory, but also provides greater detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the lower part.
The discovery also allows us to obtain detailed information regarding the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage lacks the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead possesses other characteristics typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. Researchers hypothesize that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows adult plumage and not downy fluff.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals plumage of an adult individual and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and injuring over twenty people.

They discovered that the Sun's functioning is based on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the solar system is determined by nothing more than their luminosity and rotation.
Luminosity is used in conjunction with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less stellar activity there is related to magnetic reversals.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys performed of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was seeking was supposed to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth that generates tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to infer that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory posits that much of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is gathered in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.
Television reports show white smoke billowing out of the plant.

Doctor Tony Moll identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement given in an interview, this new variant was "highly concerning and alarming, due to the high mortality rate."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the microbe within the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers at the hospital itself.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire group of people affected by tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images show thermal oscillations between day and night, demonstrating that these are likely caves.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, stated: "Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter a private booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify their identity, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral law codifies procedures in a rather rigorous manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that at the beginning of the voting process there are no envelopes present and that no others are inserted besides those of the voters, who have been duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send their representatives to observe every stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will require reconstructive facial surgery.
Uka's gun didn't go off when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider is in constant pain, blind in one eye, missing a section of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the Championships.
She was first in the slalom, where she registered a DNF (Did Not Finish) in the first run. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the run.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's "sitting" category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Hungarian GyÃ¶ngyi Dani.
Four skiers from the women's group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
The Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced, "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that moment, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with killing his own son.
She is being held pending indictment and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system has different parameters. Scottish courts have, in fact, deemed the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspected individuals are treading on dangerous ground."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the formal indictment.
According to leaked information, the document will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Reportedly, the other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to relinquish such presence for only five years.
The shooters in the experimental pest control program had to be closely supervised by the rangers, as the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four marksmen chosen for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP (Provisional Electoral Council).
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests, which began in October and challenged the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as far back as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
In its response, the ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as "absolutely deplorable."
The earthquake in the Mariana Islands was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management, no damage has been reported in the nation.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued, but at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were immediately released together with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was fatally shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
After completing her training in obstetrics, she began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began to study cases of premature labor in his free time.
His/Her research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' containing flight recordings.
Even her wrestling colleagues wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was weird like meâ€¦ Maybe even more soâ€¦ I love her and I'll miss herâ€¦ Let's hope she's in a better place," was the comment from Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to a survey conducted on 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of survey participants, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At opposite ends of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% are of the opinion that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but she experienced several ailments that raised doubts about her fitness.
He couldn't take the medications he needed to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, that is, matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office as governor since the beginning of this year; last month he signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
According to him, the speculations are nothing more than "political chatter and idiocy."
A presidential run in 2016 is hypothesized.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of the obsolete ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being provided, and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there is no parking available on site for cars or park and ride.
Fears related to the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of forcing the match to be played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird is believed to have emerged in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, United States, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much longer; this was due to mating between a Darwin's finch endemic to the island, *Geospiza fortis*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled to create minuscule forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because it could be made so thin.
This refers to the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice, it is possible to create a pH indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical element is.
The pH level of the analyzed chemical substance is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, roll them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will occur that will cause a strange sensation and form a sort of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, remains of sewage systems have been discovered in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, they were sometimes incorporated into public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and the view.
To transport a satellite or a telescope into space, a rocket taller than 100 feet is necessary.
The wheel has enormously changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile, and various other means of transportation made their appearance.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-ranging domestic cats) that feed on small prey, which are considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret to their success, a specific target that each feline has and that allows it to avoid competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The packs are made up of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and pups that can reach up to 30.
Usually, the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pride of lions acts very similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly analogous to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), also with regard to the deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not very well), swim, make very long jumps, and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't as powerful as the lion's, but it's more like a phrase of shouted, angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. When possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
Thanks to night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots camouflage themselves with their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, making a return difficult), it will likely find itself in a different environment than it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, therefore, to establish itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations compared to those previously required.
The original population hasn't changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and the new population adapts to its new environment, it resembles the other population less and less.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by them (through exhalation).
Plants produce their own food with the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses starting with plants, and we produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its era, and for that reason, it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws sprouted more than 70 teeth as sharp as razors, plus a further row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed its path there was no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that it was a cannibal.
It would attack anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex wouldn't have been able to compete with it.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference lay in the fact that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men loved to feast together lying on their side as they consumed their meal.
Naturally, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the god's dwelling.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, particular towers in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, a house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas recount that Erik the Red gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Despite all being "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Anyway, that's false. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is well known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had brought liberation to the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French people who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was called "Operation Dragoon."
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis," which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and in a certain way, therefore, also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the first entities to anticipate the idea of a nation. The culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge across generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and are thus not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and Congress was its only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes and, in the absence of a national executive or judiciary, relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between the states.
To amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all the states was necessary. These, for their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japanese consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago," given the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan came into being in the 15th century, when European sailors passing through the area recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation that affected the grain production systems of the indigenous people and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
A large part of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most widely used film at the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today, and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35mm format is 24mm and its width is 36mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to place the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
Christian religion had acted as a glue between the European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it involved the cessation of all essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law commonly accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of much of the citizenry and the nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division among the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these times, fierce wars broke out among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, among which we can cite the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism, and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave rests on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not at all easy to find, even if you knew it existed. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of the world outside.
Of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to the present day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the grand pyramidal structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
The "arcata in su" (arch up) indication resembles a V, and the "arcata in giÃ¹" (arch down) indication resembles a staple or a square without its bottom side.
Upwards means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and downwards means that you should start at the frog (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An up bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down bow results in a louder and more assertive sound.
You can choose to add your own personalized markings in pencil, but keep in mind that the bowing marks you find printed have a musical significance, so generally speaking, they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se, 11, and Louis Charles, 4), and Elisabeth, the king's sister.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the monarchs.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The costs of the U.S. imperialism's war to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime to cover a good portion of the expenses, and the interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits at the foundation of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the strict sense according to which the fate of humanity is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
A large part of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can state that the automobile necessarily entails the development of the road network.
However, a national road network only for a few cars is not economically sustainable, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently, the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a significant component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, traditions, and culture arose linked to that geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, proved to be more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its prestige diminished, especially due to the fact that the crusaders returned bringing gifts like silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style was reached between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But the slow speed of communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era, a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence farming when it is practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses saved seeds originating from the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing yields.
Historically, a large proportion of farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with shared views who do not feel represented by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Often, members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases, the abandonment is motivated by the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others appear to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, they exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not so much a learning modality, but rather an aid for those embarking on a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the little paperclip assistant from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to question, prompt, and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, or even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that doesn't guarantee them nourishment, care, and education, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care represents a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to meet all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study on audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "lasting relationships."
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that one can discover if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, new genetic variability is added; with selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to satisfy their amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savanna.
Furthermore, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and, ultimately, even death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless cooked.
Animal-based foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, eggs), are not only easy to digest, but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way somewhat similar to how savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10â€“60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of awareness without fully waking you up.
If you decide to reset your alarm while sleepy, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options involve consuming a lot of liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace in inverse proportion to the tension existing in their body and spirit.
The less the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each of us has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is hindered only by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
Generally speaking, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts caused the breakdown between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies; thus began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, immediately proved obsolete, the moment more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transportation of goods is definitely the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The historical task of navies has always been to safeguard a nation's ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the same ability of its enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples supporting this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, attempted to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Great Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be raised by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have easy access to milk, fleece, meat, and hide.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds left free to roam the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Despite being simply made of parallel wooden planks, wagonways, when compared to the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed the horses that traversed them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early on to keep the rails in position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, even though the iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails made their appearance.
The first means of transport that man knew was his legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also engage in activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If, instead, we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and deactivate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a great deal due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, while problems have increased due to overpopulation and humans' extravagant lifestyles.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, today known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall, and John Nixon was entrusted with the task.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9th, while a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that they share with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have scaly feet with claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the foundation of all computers used today.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and in technical computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately obvious. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of medication or harmful chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to that poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become human parasites.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for approximately 400,000 known cases, ranking it first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely as males to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or in their child's best interest.
These couples have the possibility to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method effectively guides the majority of scientific inquiry.
But it's not just about experimentation, given that an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also helps guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are critically dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not merely reactions to external periodic signals, in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators whose free-running cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, that is, viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, highlighting the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
The mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural villages to drive to work, passing other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth, everyone is somehow connected to and simultaneously supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transportation systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it's rare to hear similar levels of complaints regarding water quality or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why are they failed every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper reasons?
"Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to exhibit reasonable consistency and can be generically represented mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing, and managing road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
A large proportion of insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small nooks and crannies to hide from predators.
Of all the insects existing today, the only ones that are unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
For some, he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on Earth. It carries a volume of water equal to 8 times that of the second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that reaches six miles in some places.
20% of all the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of grandeur and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted, admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City consists of approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people who work within the State, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholic.
Humans began to understand basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper in ancient times: these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These actually resemble more the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Obviously, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of minimal quantities of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil thus proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and is used less and less.
Today, everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to go near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what fate awaits the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis for how a fission bomb works.
In practice, it's like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Therefore, by further splitting the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no stimulus.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The maria might be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites certain people and drives them to want to do what they do, and what the contextual factors are in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, and define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager transforms into a completely different person, who feels they have to change the entire operation of the team and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often creates disagreement between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their nearby physical team.
They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings may occur depending on various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of an actual "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The management team that each member reports to, and which sets the standards for each member, is referred to as the "invisible team."
Why should an organization be willing to undertake the long process of building a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts may be innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, a collaborative approach within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new and innovative process for meeting customer needs.
For an organization to define itself as innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological findings have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The area of research becomes more narrow and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is at the core of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect behavior and alter specific mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never observed before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
AI research includes building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of applications are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, speech, and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also an excellent pretext for sharing travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned each year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by poor grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, the blog author strives to improve their writing in order to avoid negative reviews.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment that surrounds them." The need to fuel public interest motivates students to be resourceful and engaging (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool designed to encourage collaboration and foster student learning far beyond the normal school day.
"The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the story of the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, you can admire the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka region, and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in the opinion of foreigners.
The vast northernmost areas are sparsely populated, and some of these are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
If you compare the populations, the result may be surprising to many: in the United States, the number of African American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In those lands, the Arabs also brought Islam, which embarked on a long journey towards the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travelers: all are advised to declare themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they themselves consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the strength to refuse men, and don't be afraid to object (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city, which was called Daru l-Badya and later named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who chose these places for their trading posts.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the area around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and lots of trinkets, but all of this is only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying a large part of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to research thoroughly before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to properly assess the state of the clashes that still persist in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
It is possible to use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it even has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
With its touch that is more Moorish than African, the city distinctly stands out from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, borders Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 kmÂ², the park encompasses 14 different ecozones, each of which provides sustenance to a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and park entrance fees apply.
Purchasing a Wild Card could also be useful, as it grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar graph, made all the more striking because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has concentrated on the densely populated reclaimed land of the northern coast.
This is the place that English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of this land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world. It extends 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest included in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not just made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the impressive jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 kmÂ², of which about one-third is made up of marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary; the area is estimated to be home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it would be wise to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, in Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
Its two pylons are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it only opened to traffic in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints will probably be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the PayaguÃ¡, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas.
Here, you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year as well.
For information on tournaments and purchasing tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their own official currency, the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars as well.
It is likely that credit cards are not accepted on the outlying islands, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures above 30Â°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer reading.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a safe distance. It is necessary to give these animals adequate space as they are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with very strong smells, and try to keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port occurred the infamous naval standoff of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the paramount chief.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are divided into three areas.
The beaches facing the Pacific Ocean on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide selection of shops. It is safe to swim here.
The most well-known local beer is a simple, pleasant, and refreshing beer called "Number One." The other local beer is called "Manta."
You can have many French wines, but the Australian and New Zealand ones might handle the journey better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the 'flat white' coffee originates from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is a short black coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on par with the Belgian one. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions are made to the coral reef, and injuries due to these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, adhere to the instructions, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear from October to April near beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period, they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles primarily consists of river estuaries north of Rockhampton, as they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can still book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even flight+hotel deals.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted to the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
During some music festivals, the majority of participants decide to camp on-site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, it's necessary to arrive early and secure a spot near the music.
Remember that once the music on the main stages is finished, there may be sections of the festival where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as traversing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are more exposed to it.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time dedicated to exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa-free entry (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything they can to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer food, drinks, and exclusive entertainment to keep the guests' spirits high and encourage them to stay longer.
In some establishments, alcoholic drinks are offered on the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone deciding to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or near-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced, and you can't drive as you would on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Precipitation and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle's windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of many visitors' vacations.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to overland journeys, particularly in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is sufficient to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid, and for this reason, it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations scattered throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held there in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies as of late March 2020 do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most event tickets is expected to be between Â¥2,500 and Â¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost approximately Â¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one available.
Be careful not to expose the fabrics to excessively high temperatures to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water, and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, many minutes are required.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if in doubt, it is advisable to consider purchasing bottled water in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst cases, trigger allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions, as it frequently passes through isolated areas amidst vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and tight curves predominate.
The speed limits posted are significantly lower than those enforced on the preceding and following sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Strict adherence to them is extremely important.
Oddly enough, however, in this area the mobile phone service coverage is much higher than in other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rather flavorful and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who wish to taste small but flavorful pastries can opt for those which, depending on the region, are called Berliners, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be presented as either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is typically used for curries in the inland regions; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern areas of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a range of simple dishes; its predominant flavors come from the use of peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on either side of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability for the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck.
If a jockey is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged by the escaping horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially English ones, have incorporated safety bars, which ensure that a leather stirrup detaches from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it backward.
CochamÃ³ Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of enormous granite walls and cliffs are found.
The peaks of the summits include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly charting new routes on its potentially infinite walls.
Downhill snow sports like skiing and snowboarding are very popular and involve gliding on snow using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes even referred to as "ski bums," who dedicate entire vacation periods to skiing in a particular ski area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski trekking.
It is related, although it doesn't usually include them, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a path similar to a hiking trail.
If conditions are good, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than when walking, but you will only very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries, one would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, with regard to this aspect, the Schengen area functions more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can usually go from one border to another without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money, and bureaucracy.
There isn't a universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider an object to be an antique if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition shows geographical differences regarding the age limit, which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts could be defined as antiques, even if more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the SÃ¡mi, and the culture upon which this trade rests also underpins many other professions.
Even over time, not all SÃ¡mi have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry; some lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Today, many SÃ¡mi people hold modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in SÃ¡pmi, the territory of the SÃ¡mi.
Even though widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word "zingaro" (gypsy) is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a mistaken perception of Roma people.
If a travel advisory is issued for the destination you will be visiting, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
You might also be interested in the opinions of governments different from your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
To give an example, American citizens in the Middle East might encounter different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The notices simply constitute a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, generic, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to indicate any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in any part of the world, and there are different types, depending on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, above-average rainfall, and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similarly to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal high-intensity meteorological phenomena are blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as these may impact travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely lead you to the address of a local company.
A course would normally cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A course typically lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, as well as plenty of first aid training activities and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, while publications focusing on war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return trip.
The intention of governments to issue passports without gender markers (X) or updated documents to reflect a desired name and gender varies.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Even security screening inspections have become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to pass through security screenings without their privacy and dignity being impacted.
Rip currents are formed by the return flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topography, backflow concentrates in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back won't be any more difficult than usual.
Try to identify an area where you won't risk being trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue, based on your abilities and whether you have been spotted.
Reverse culture shock manifests in a shorter time than culture shock (as the "honeymoon phase" is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to their own culture of origin.
Returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your original culture.
In your first experience abroad, you likely encountered patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people didn't imagine that patience and awareness would also be necessary for those returning to their home country.
The pyramid's sound and light show is the most interesting thing for children in the area.
Before the show begins, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally, you can always hear the noise made by tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and the narrator of a long tale.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; on the latter, the caldera of a still-active volcano, filled with water, forms a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula and faces the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, before re-emerging and forming the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km long range bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone generally isn't a substitute for a cell phone because, to make a call, you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational boats, including yachts, as well as missions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information regarding connection to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among recent graduates, as they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to one's home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, both within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly expansive enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular occurrence (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa will not be required for going ashore (starting in 2009) when using ship excursions.
Some brochures even offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and the city visit is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's not dissimilar to the fears and personal aversions that many people display towards other things.
For some people, understanding a little about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown, or on a feeling of lack of control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often, timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would have required days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked baggage. And that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow shipping luggage without a passenger.
To fly first class or business class, the most obvious way is to shell out a good amount of money for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do it).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, one can expect to shell out up to four times the normal economy fare for Business class travel and up to eleven times the fare for those in first class!
Generally speaking, on direct flights from A to B, it's not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving at their destination quickly and comfortably, and as a result, they apply certain fares.
The capital of Moldova is ChiÈ™inÄƒu, and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the site of an ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, complete with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two regions of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is situated on a vast bay, surrounded by mountains, and now forms a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center.
Although the city has an atmosphere more akin to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with characteristic red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik, you can enjoy beautiful views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, some of the tombs feature interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north lies the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily reachable. It became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to Lord Byron's brilliant account of its splendors.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always heading north, visit the grand Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a place of worship), a site of Marian apparitions famous throughout the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is essentially a mass grave, and it has an almost incalculable significance for a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by staining the structures with marks or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, and the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the primary official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
On the subway, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service disruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, thanks to an automated system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and presumptuous.
Even though it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still to be on your best behavior, interacting like a "bien Ã©levÃ©" (well-mannered) person. This will definitely make your life easier.
The Parisians' rough exterior will quickly fade if you display some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils, and altitude levels, it presents a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a great variety of animal species and birds.
These places are home to rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie, alongside several other more common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer stoles to women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it's brightly colored, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long trousers that reach below the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple, popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the formal "you", always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is being used in a substantivized form makes the writing quite complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure you pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means beloved, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could greatly help you with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimal knowledge of Spanish may jump to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is similar enough and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Usually nowadays, pre-modern observatories are obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't a problem in their heyday like it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes intended for research are enormous structures in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants thrive when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting a few plant specimens will cost you removal from the premises, without discussion.
Generally, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around; you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their respective wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes inside Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a vacation.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to visit the interesting cities on the Danube, or sail on the Erie Canal.
Furthermore, they define the routes of well-known hiking trails and cycle paths.
Christmas represents one of the most important holidays in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
One tradition involves spending Easter night staying awake in an outdoor location to admire the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations underlying this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often celebrated on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with congregations frequently beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got there by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because the distance from the mainland was considerable, mammals were unable to make the journey. This led to the giant tortoise becoming the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of humans.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the chance to witness the aurora borealis, because the sky remains dark for almost the entire day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal compared to what Westerners tend to be used to.
Office attire typically consists of a suit and tie or a pantsuit, and colleagues are addressed by their last name or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it emphasizes team commitment rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get approval from their superiors regarding every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without questioning them.
