This not only confirms the already well-known theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils typically cannot, such as three-dimensionality and color.
Scientists say that the feathers of these animals are chestnut brown on top and have a light or carotenoid hue underneath.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Researchers speculate that the rachis is similar to later evolutionary development as other features of feathers - the barb and barbules - are present, but the dinosaur feather lacks a rachis, which is known as a well-developed axis of a feather.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were used to regulate temperature or for display, not for flight. Researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage rather than the fluffy feathers of a hatchling.
Researchers note that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not the downy feathers of a hatchling.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two people and injured twenty others.

The tasks performed were largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made in connection with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
The team suspects that what they are seeing could be the result of tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on the Earth causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter, like ordinary matter, affects other dark matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter located around a galaxy is situated around it as a halo and is composed of numerous tiny particles.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that this new variant is "very dangerous" because it "shows a very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have contracted the germ in the hospital, and Dr. Maul speculates that at least two of them are hospital health workers.
Over a year, one infected person could spread it to 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among the entire population affected by tuberculosis still appears to be very low; for instance, in South Africa, it is 6,000 out of 330,000 infected with the disease.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters enter a booth alone and place a pre-printed sheet bearing the name of their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After the officers verify the voter's identity, the voter deposits the envelope into the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
French electoral law strictly regulates campaign finance.
From 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see with their own eyes that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under close supervision, following specific procedures.

The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been recovered by the Madhya Pradesh Police.
Deputy Inspector General of Police D.K. Ariya stated, "We have arrested five rapists who assaulted the Swiss woman, and her phone and laptop have been recovered."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the suspects arrived in court with their faces covered.
When the car crashed into the house, there were three people inside, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
Emergency services temporarily closed the road where the accident occurred while extricating the driver from the Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeokoya has been sentenced by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of his son.
She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but her image has been widely publicized, which could taint eyewitness testimony.
While this is common practice elsewhere in the UK, Scots law operates differently and the publication of photographs is often viewed prejudicially by the courts.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it appears journalists are placed in a dangerous situation if suspects' photos are publicised."
The Office of the Attorney General has informed journalists that no statement will be issued regarding the overall indictment charge, at least until the indictment.
According to the information released, the document relates to the border dispute, specifically the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war, as Palestine requires.
Other topics covered included a future Jerusalem state that would be pure to both countries and the crisis in the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after a treaty is signed, while the PA is agreeing to allow that presence for only up to five years.
Because the supplementary pest control test was supervised and its effectiveness was appreciated, its shooters had to be closely monitored by the rangers.
In conjunction with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received extensive safety training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in by a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP).
It is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
As part of a package of measures to take the country to new elections, a presidential commission last month recommended the resignation of the former CEP.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the authorities in October.
The sometimes-violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due in 2011.
Approximately 60 defective iPods, which overheated, have been reported, including six fires in total, causing minor burn injuries to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 emergency accidents related to devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded to Apple's report being postponed by saying "Truly tragic".
An earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Marianas said that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by seizing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and it has been confirmed that at least six people have died.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released earlier, similar to the Philippine photographers.
The photographers later took her place because the old woman needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the Liggins Hospital, she began to investigate premature births during her free time.
His research showed that the maturity of the fetal lungs in the infant accelerates when a hormone is administered.
Xinhua reported that government inspectors found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestling heroes also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna is the ultimate queen. My first manager. She died on a night of two moons. She was that unique. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as mysterious as me... maybe even more so... We love her and will miss her... She's in a good place."
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay swimming events at the Commonwealth Games, but he claims his physical fitness is questionable.
Because the necessary medicine to alleviate his pain is banned at the Olympics, he has been unable to take it.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever found on January 25.
By the first half of February, several individuals, using various hardware and software, had confirmed this discovery, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source that brought water and, at the same time, organic matter capable of producing proteins that support life to Earth.
Scientists believe that understanding how planets form, especially how Earth formed, may be possible because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo began his governorship earlier this year and last month signed into law the bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called those rumors "political babble and idiocy."
He made a significant investment in the 2016 presidential election.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional transportation facilities, and surface trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking or park-and-ride facilities at the grounds.
The lack of transportation created a situation where the game might have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters, due to fear.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
According to researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, this new species has evolved in just two generations. This process was believed to take much longer, as it resulted from breeding between the native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be turned into almost any shape. It can be rolled into a small shape.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, and it can be twisted and knitted. It can be hammered into sheets and wrapped.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was used to decorate books, sometimes with hand-painted pictures, known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called pH in chemistry. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical is.
pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen in the chemical being tested (H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electron (because a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Grind both types of dry powders together and then squeeze them with clean, damp hands until they form a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, providing amusement and creating a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house was equipped with a flush toilet system connected to a modern drainage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets also existed. In Roman civilization, toilets existed as part of public baths, where men and women sometimes mingled together.
When you talk to someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call, after which it immediately reflects downwards.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is required to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in unbelievable ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to provide easier and faster transportation.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
They are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized game, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that prey on small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of a unique task being undertaken by each individual, preventing them from competing with one another.
The most social cats are lions, who live in large groups called prides.
Prides are made up of 1 to 3 related adult male lions and about 30 females and cubs.
Female animals in a large family, being sisters and daughters, are usually closely related to each other.
Lion prides operate with a behavior surprisingly similar to wolf or dog packs (but not other big cats), and are extremely deadly to their prey in their behavior.
A well-built tiger can climb trees (though not perfectly), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these 4 cats have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar, unlike the lion's full-throated roar, is like a sentence composed of rough, screaming words.
The American wildcat prefers to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, mice, and even birds if possible. Most of the animals the American wildcat hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that American bobcats hunt for food (prey) by stalking and then using their sense of smell to identify where the animals have been on the ground.
They have excellent night vision, allowing them to see well in the dark, and they can walk very quietly and stealthily. American bobcats blend in with their surroundings, stalk their prey, and pounce on it.
A small group of organisms (a small population), when separated from the main population from which they came (whether they cross a mountain range or a river, or arrive on a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return), often faces a different environment than they previously experienced.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population requires different features or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than they needed to be before.
Remaining completely unchanged in their original habitat, they still require the same adaptations they had before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look increasingly different from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this speciation, that is, the generation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (that is, exhale).
Plants produce the food they need from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Much of what we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mesosaurus was the apex predator of its time, fearing nothing but another Mesosaurus.
Its jaws were lined with over 70 sharp and pointed teeth, and the upper part of its mouth was packed with an extra set of teeth, meaning that nothing caught in it could escape.
Although we don't know for sure, it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mesosaurs, and it may have also been cannibalistic.
It attacked anything that entered the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. Rex couldn't face it.
While much of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual food habits, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and mice known as dormice.
Another thing is, poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, while rich men preferred to feast, gathering together and reclining to eat.
Roman's past meals may not have contained food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which they considered the god's home.
People brought offerings for the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the gods' needs through rituals and ceremonies.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctum that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, there were special pyramid-shaped towers, known as "sigurats," built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the gods.
In the hot Middle Eastern climate, the house wasn't very useful.
The Jewish family spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; there were only open windows facing the road towards the shops. Stone was used to build the houses.
Since the land of Canaan did not have large forests, the price of wood was very high.
Human settlements were very sparse in Greenland. According to Norse mythology, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and upon traveling further west, discovered Greenland and named it so.
But whatever his discovery was, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though each of those countries is 'Scandinavian,' there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something was written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." This text appears upside down on the back of the document.
Although no one knows who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (measuring 29 3/4 and 24 1/2 inches) was rolled up for storage in its early days.
Therefore, it can be assumed that the marking was simply added as a label.
Although the D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the northern part of France, the south was still not free.
It was controlled by the "Vichy" French. They were the French people who, having made peace with the Germans in 1940, worked with them instead of fighting against the invaders.
The Allied forces invaded Southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was known as "Operation Dragoon."
Within a mere two weeks, Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unified culture and society enjoyed by a significantly large group of people who live and work together cooperatively.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin words "civilis," meaning civil, "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and somehow implies the size of the society.
The city-state predates nations. A civilization implies knowledge passed down through generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable propagation.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving behind any relevant historical evidence, failing to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states united and established the first weak central government with a common constitution - its only component being the Congress.
Because there was no national executive or judiciary, Congress had no power to levy taxes and had to rely on federal authorities who often did not cooperate in enforcing its acts.
It also did not have the power to override interstate tax laws and customs duties.
To amend the constitution, the unanimous approval of all states was required according to the constitution, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often did not attend.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Football, basketball, netball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing are among the popular sports.
Italians compete in international sports and Olympic events, and winter sports are most popular in the northern regions.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (the largest island being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands in Japan, geographically Japan is almost always referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins are marked in the 15th century, with European sailors passing by and reporting on it under the name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established itself in southwestern Taiwan and transformed indigenous grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, thereby ceding control of Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings on the complex's boundaries have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how the buildings originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this is still ongoing.
For example, the most widely used still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the predominant film size during the analog film era.

The 35mm format is actually quite confusing, as it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format is said to be 3:2 (obtained by dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g., APS family formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The Rule of Thirds, often criticized and ridiculed, is a simple guideline for maintaining order in the proportions of an image and creating dynamism.
This means that the most suitable location for the main object is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
The wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under intense scrutiny during this period in European history.
Despite differences in language and customs, European states have been bound together by Christianity for over a thousand years.
Its pervasive influence affected everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main teachings of Christianity is that wealth should be used to eradicate poverty and suffering, and the church's financial resources exist for that specific reason.
The central authority of the Church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and questions arose as to whether this concentration of power and wealth fulfilled its discipline.
Following the emergence of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
Even though it violated commonly accepted international law, formulated by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries, this strategy of cutting off essential military and civilian supplies proved effective.
To prevent ships from accessing that entire section of the sea, the British laid mines in international waters, which also posed a danger to ordinary ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare as well.
Peacefulness and isolation were the main attitudes of many citizens and nations in the 1920s.
Having witnessed the horror and brutality of World War I, nations were eager to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with his name, a book of poems, a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job), and 4 cents.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, there was an unstable period with divided provinces between each dynasty. Of these periods, the most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Fierce wars erupted during this period among many aristocrats vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China, with thousands dying in the struggle to ascend to the highest seat in the grand palace of Xian.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Moreover, even after the revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and success-oriented individuals to succeed.
Since the military was based on talent rather than rank, the same thing happened in the military as well.
The French Revolution also led many in the suppressed working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad showed a keen interest in matters beyond worldly life. He used to go to a cave called "Hira" on the mountain called "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cave, which has existed for a long time, also provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
This cave, located on a mountain peak north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, even if someone knows it exists, it is not easy to find. Once inside the cave, it is complete isolation.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, one can only see or hear a very small part of the world.
The only one of the Seven Wonders that still remains today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the Pharaohs who ascended to heaven.
The Giza Necropolis, located on the Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while the other smaller pyramids, tombs, and shrines were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper bow" mark looks like a V, while the "lower bow" mark resembles an upside-down staple or a square-like shape.
Going up means you should start from the upper end of the bow and push the bow, and going down means you should start from the lower end of the bow and pull the bow (where you are holding the bow with your hand).
An up-bow stroke typically produces a softer sound, while a down-bow stroke is stronger and more defined.
You can take pencil markings as you need, but remember that printed expense markings are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), along with the king's sister Elisabeth, were sent from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, amidst a riotous mob of people threatening and shouting abuse against the King and Queen.
The rioters forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a member of the rioting mob brandished the head of a royal guard, who had been killed in Versailles, before the terrified queen.
The burden of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial administration through Wall Street banking institutions to cover interest and a major portion of expenses on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government.
Indeed, for a long time, the excessive income generated from the exploitation of the Filipino people is among the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that accelerated the impetus for the creation of the order.
The period in which these events occurred is generally considered to be the High Middle Ages in European history, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a practically broad range of ideas, from technological push or the necessity of technology, to the strong feeling that human destiny is guided by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and by expressing them through technology.
Many definitions of technological determinism share two common notions: that technological development follows a path largely beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology "impacts" intrinsically social societies more than socially constructed societies.
For example, someone might say that the motor car is definitely a cause of road development.
However, maintaining a road network across the country for only a handful of cars is not economically feasible, therefore new production methods will be developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Large-scale motor vehicle ownership increases the risk of road accidents and leads to the discovery of new healthcare methods for repairing damaged body parts.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural criteria, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture relevant to that geography arose, and these were more suitable for conforming to one's place in society than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined mainly during the twelfth century as the crusaders returned with treasures such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this period that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic tradition reached a very high level between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing in the Orient was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western fashions could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the medieval period, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result, one of the biggest developments of that time was the Crusaders starting to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is the practice of farming where farmers produce just enough food to meet the needs of themselves and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic method that utilizes seeds native to the specific environmental zone, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple yield-enhancing techniques.
From the distant past, many farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who are disregarded by social norms, and allow them to build an identity.
Subcultures can be unique due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture's distinctiveness can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often signal their membership in distinctive and symbolic ways through styles, rituals, and dialects.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus on children who have been victims of unfortunate events, such as neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, who were not properly socialized by adults during their growing years.
Such children are called "violent" or unruly. Some violent children are ostracized by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, a severe intellectual or physical disability may cause these parents to reject a child.
These violent children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When untamed children are raised entirely by non-human animals (within physical boundaries), they exhibit the same fear or indifference towards humans as the protective animal itself.
Project-based learning should make learning easy and interesting, and scaffolding goes beyond a step.
Support is not a learning method but merely assistance provided to those undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software and is intended to allow the student to question, inquire, and clarify procedures regarding what may be challenging for them to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and abandonment.
No child should have to grow up in an environment devoid of nutrition, care, and education, yet it happens.
We see the supportive care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is meant to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Compassionate care means providing all the needs they did not receive in their previous home.
The internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of ease of use and access to information.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Aimee and McCord (1998) conducted research on audience responses to websites, they identified "personal connection" and "ongoing relationship" as new motivational perspectives.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial movements that last for mere milliseconds.
Specifically, one can check if a person is lying by accurately interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech," notes how people with speech comprehension deficits due to brain damage can accurately assess sincerity.
He suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
A 20th-century study revealed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
The variation in the mixing of assortment and recombination – moving forward and backward between the two pools – changes with each generation.
Outside of savannas, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has severe consequences: growth stunting, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
Although the easiest to obtain plant resources could have been the proteins in leafy greens and legumes, they are difficult for primates like us to digest if uncooked.
Comparatively, while animal-based food (ants, beetle larvae, eggs) are not easily digestible, they provide high quantities of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if we say that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannas do today.
Sleep deprivation is intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a gentle alarm clock, waking you up gradually without fully startling you.
If you reset your sleep clock, you could put it on the other side of the room, so you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other circadian rhythm-based hacks include drinking excessive amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known diuretics) before bed, which forces one to wake up to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely related to the level of stress in their body and mind.
Maintaining a low level of stress makes the continuation of life force more positive. Every person has the ability to find complete peace and contentment.
Every person can find peace. The only obstacle in striving to achieve this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but consists largely of the Mahayana path of love and the techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (potential energy/energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualizing various goddesses, energy pathways are purified, chakras are activated, and liberation is achieved through enlightened awareness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, paving the way for cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes between systems, processes, and cultures led to the separation of states.
Two years after the war ended, former collaborators became enemies, and a cold war began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the Contras actually waged war from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the Romanian Bridgehead.
"However, all these plans were nullified almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland, violating the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, the Peace of Riga, and other international agreements, including bilateral and multilateral treaties."
Shipping goods by ships is the most efficient way to transport people and goods in large quantities across the oceans.
Traditionally, the role of sailors is to enable the movement of people and goods of your country, and, in the meantime, to hinder the movement of people and goods of your enemy.
One notable recent example of this is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II, when Americans attempted to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to support Britain.
Immediately, German sailors, mainly with the help of U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have potentially conquered Britain in the same way it had conquered the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Historically, cultures and tribes began keeping them as an easy way to obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept as herds that roamed in the mountains or other grasslands, and they were often cared for by children or adolescents, who were known as shepherds. These care methods are still in use today.
Wagonways in England were built as far back as the 16th century.
Even though the cart tracks consisted merely of parallel planks, the horses were able to pull them at greater speeds and to pull larger loads on the somewhat rough roads during the day.
Cross-linking was introduced to maintain the alignment of the row. Gradually, however, it was realized that it would be more efficient to place an iron bar above them.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the carts to wear out more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first complete iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation is walking; humans began walking with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man") over two million years ago.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not habitually stand and walk.
While Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago, the bipedal specializations were found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 - 3.9 million years.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and by becoming activists, we can contribute to minimizing future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of mankind, but problems have also increased due to population growth and a lifestyle that exceeds human capacity.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, a draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located beyond several buildings.
Between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlop Broadside", were set up at night.
John Nixon publicly read this document for the first time on July 8th at the Independence Hall premises.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The Dunlop Broadsides 25, which still exist, are the oldest copies of that document. The original manuscript has been destroyed.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives on today; we call them birds.
Because they have wings and can fly, many people do not think of them as dinosaurs.
But there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled and clawed feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are common, so a diagnosis may not be made quickly.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is finding a medicine container or a container of toxic household chemicals open.
Check the label to see if there are specific first aid instructions for the particular poison.
Entomologists use the word bug in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term comes from bed bugs, a type of insect that used to feed on people in the past.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are hematophagous and adapted to live in nests or the habitat of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple can decide whether adopting a baby is good for the child and for them.
These couples may decide to create a surrogacy plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method truly guides many scientific investigations.
But that's not all, experimentation also joins it, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; questioning and observation also provide guidance to the scientific method.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view of science, encompassing everything including psychology, was accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of the Greek language, the West appears to have become separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the presence of endocrine cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely a response to external periodic cues, have been documented in many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can continue in a cycle running freely, even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important proposals stating that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, either labeling the DNA in bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus or labeling the protein in bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have varying consequences depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germ cells are passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are keen to visit natural areas, including plants and wildlife, with the aim of enjoying beautiful scenery.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is coming to see the orangutans in Borneo, taking photos, and learning about them.
Every morning, people leave their small rural towns in cars to go to their workplaces, passing others who work in the places they left.
Within this dynamic transportation cycle, everyone is connected in some way, and a transportation system based on private vehicles is supported.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation methods. Almost everyone complains about transportation methods.
In developed countries, accusations of this nature regarding water quality or bridge collapses are rarely heard.
Why are such accusations leveled against transportation systems, and why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers really that incompetent? Or is there some other situation?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two locations and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable range; accordingly, traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key features: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections are helpful for planning, designing, and implementing road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Although some thought he was right, most opposed him; they thought that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, since we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, holding 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, and is sometimes about six miles wide.
20 percent of the water released from the land into the sea through rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction from stone continued until the latter part of the ancient kingdom, nothing ever surpassed the scale of the Giza pyramids and the technological excellence of those constructions.
In the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were already a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest country in the world and the one with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its law-making and official communications.
The language used daily by many who work in the state is also Italian, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
Humans have been aware of such basic chemical components since ancient times because things like gold, silver, and copper exist naturally in nature and can be mined relatively easily with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle stated that everything is made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This most closely corresponds to the four states of matter (in that order): earth, water, air, and fire, and he builds the theory on the premise that it changes into the new elements we see.
Alloys are essentially a combination of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are a number of elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic components such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are astonishingly small, and there could be trillions of them within the full stop at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when the pencil was first introduced, it was a good friend to many people.
The unfortunate thing is that the pencil has been relegated to a very low status and usage due to the emergence of other new methods of writing.
Now, people write messages on computer screens without even going near a pencil sharpener.
One might wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle of energy created by combining a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy cart up a hill. The nucleus then divides again, releasing some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to decay with little or no provocation.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The near side of the surface is about 70 kilometers thick, and the far side is about 100 kilometers thick.
It is thinner under the plains of the Moon and thicker under the highlands.
The surface is thinner, so there may be more tidal waves nearby. It would have been easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what people desire or what attracts them.
These theories state that people internalize certain needs and/or desires by the time they reach adulthood.
These theories examine what motivates certain individuals to act, and how their surroundings influence what they do or do not do.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
In a typical scenario, two behaviors can surface when managers lead their former peers. One end of that spectrum involves trying to remain "one of the guys."
These types of managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct performance appraisals, delegate responsibility, and hold individuals accountable.
The other end of the spectrum is becoming an unrecognizable individual who feels compelled to change everything the group has been doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in division between leaders and the rest of the team.
Online communities also hold that standard of excellence, but they have subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their closest physical team.
They often have more autonomy than a traditional team member because their teams may meet according to different time zones that are not understood by their local management.
The existence of a "non-visible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is another distinctive characteristic of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" refers to the management team to which all members report. The Invisible Team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization need to undertake the process of establishing a learning organization that takes a long time? One purpose of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used effectively across the operational functions of an organization.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can move towards a new innovative process that serves the needs of the consumer.
Before an organization modernizes, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes continuous improvement as an approach used to reach a higher level of performance in an organization.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to examining knowledge, thereby narrowing the field of research and making the research more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior assists scientists in conducting their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause certain changes in mental functioning.
The rise of new technologies allows us to investigate and visualize the brain's structures and processes in unprecedented ways.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to create model frameworks that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence strongly exhibits science fiction characteristics, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligence processing of machines.
AI research involves enabling a machine to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Controlling and planning handwriting, voice, and facial recognition capabilities, as well as the ability to troubleshoot customer errors and answer questions, are examples of this.
Such things have become different disciplines, focusing on solving real-life problems.
AI systems, having been subtly present in home computers and some video game applications, are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a huge part of any classroom. Often a teacher likes to take their students to places where a bus ride isn't an option.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or appreciate beautiful artwork while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a good way to share the experience with future classes by going on a trip with them.
For example, every year students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and while the website is recreated each year, the old versions are kept online for use as a field book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to become intelligent about the world around them" and encourages students to be skillful and engaging in order to present according to the needs of the audience (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Using blogs appropriately "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their position within the context of others' writings and outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada is a beautiful bilingual capital adorned with a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, while to the north lies Muskoka and beyond, pristine natural beauty.
All of this, along with other special features, highlights Ontario, which is considered by outsiders to be a very important Canadian origin.
The large area of depressions furthest to the north is very sparsely populated, and some parts are uninhabited forest.
In a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
Those East African islands lie off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is the largest of these, and when it comes to wildlife, it is practically a continent.
The vast majority of very small islands are either independent nations, associated with France, or known for luxury beach resorts.
Arabs brought Islam to other countries, and it largely took root in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Woman: Regardless of marital status, it is recommended that every female traveler say she is married.
Also, wearing a ring (that doesn't appear too expensive) is helpful.
Women should understand that what is perceived as harassment may be due to cultural differences, and that things like being followed or being pulled by the hand are not uncommon.
Be more firm when rejecting men, don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt under the name Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Beida, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established their trading headquarters there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places in Morocco for shopping.
It's easy to find traditional Moroccan goods around the old Medina, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and djellabas spread throughout the area, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located east of Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, burying many of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, travels outside of Goma should be researched to understand the conflict situation in North Kivu province.
This city is the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and also one of the places in Africa to go see mountain gorillas at the lowest cost.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical (local) fare for a short trip is around 500 Congolese Francs.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for any distant, remote place.
Though Timbuktu is a city with tourist attractions and an airport, today it has become a city plagued by poverty.
Due to the threat of desert sand, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, "Wonders of the African World".
Because the city has more of an Arabic feel than an African one, it takes on an almost completely different appearance compared to the rest of the country's cities.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east. It is bordered by Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
This park covers a land area of 19,500 square kilometers, providing shelter for a variety of wildlife, and is divided into 14 different ecological zones.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Almost all South African national parks have daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
Purchasing a Wild Card, which allows access to selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa, would also be advantageous.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the main focus for many tourists.
Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a dazzling bar graph reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
A significant portion of Hong Kong Island's urban development is built on reclaimed land along its northern coast.
This is where British colonizers seized as their own, and if you are looking for evidence of the land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world and stretches 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast, between Bangladesh and Indian extremities.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest located within Indian territory is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forest does not only consist of mangrove swamps - it also contains remnants of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 sq km, of which about one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is now estimated to be home to about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses to the east and towards Jakar/Bumthang leave especially between 6:30 and 7:30, but buses also depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day.
As inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In many districts, convenient and reliable small Japanese coaster bus services are provided.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two pylons here extend to a height of 83 meters, and this bridge, which has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters, is 378 meters long.
The horizontal clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, around the same time the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in eastern Paraguay, who lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers while also engaging in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Gigantic Indian Province of the Indies," emerged in the 16th century as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The colonization period started by the Spanish lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament will be held in December at the Las Canitas polo grounds.
Small tournaments and competitions can also be seen here during other times of the year.
For polo tournament news and where to get tickets, check with the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged on the islands at the only bank located opposite the Stanley's FIC West store.
British Pounds are accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
While British and US currency may be available on remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted; check with owners in advance to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
Falkland currency cannot be exchanged outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: although temperatures rarely drop below freezing, the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't distinct wet and dry seasons: rainfall remains consistent throughout the year.
Although the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife are creatures of the wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from other wildlife.
Despite how tame they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and virtually any large animal are capable of charging you on sight.
Each year, dozens of tourists are injured by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, aggressive, and often ferocious, so they must be given the space they need.
In addition to this, remember that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking scented food and remember to keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a fierce naval clash in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
Except for one British warship, all ships were sunk. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to its location between two harbors, Auckland has many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost entirely sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shade provided by coconut palm trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, between the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, lined with a good selection of shops, are family beaches that can sometimes get crowded. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which, although not a complex beer, is excellent and refreshing. The other local beer is known as "Manta".
Although many French wines were available, New Zealand and Australian wines were more suitable for the trip.
While local tap water is completely safe to drink, bottled drinking water is easy to find if you are concerned about it.
The concept of 'white coffee only' is foreign to Australians. Short black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino is topped with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is more expensive, but excellent.
The rock is visited frequently throughout the year, yet injuries caused by these conditions on the rock are rare.
However, obtain advice from all authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish originate in coastal areas and near estuaries from October to April in 1770. Outside of these times, they are rarely found.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, and their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing they will have somewhere to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Although travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may be able to hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
Any amendments or requests should be sent through the tour operator and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on-site, with many participants considering it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to watch the show up close, you'll have to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Although the music on the main stage has ended, remember that music in some parts of the festival may continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic region in winter, check the location of the cabin, because when traveling through the ice, those who are most exposed hear a very loud noise.
Passenger ships spend time in the city of St. Petersburg. Passengers on the ship do not require a visa (check the regulations).
Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by the guests who visit them. They typically have no windows or clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
They typically feature special food, beverage, and entertainment offerings, which are intended to keep guests in good spirits and retain them on the premises.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are served freely, however, as intoxication dulls judgment, skilled gamblers are well aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high altitudes or more mountainous routes should be aware of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
Ice and snow-covered roads have low friction, and you can't drive like you would on an asphalt road.
During blizzards, snow can fall so quickly that you can become trapped in a very short time.
Visibility may be limited due to falling or blowing snow, or ice resulting from condensation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic often continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is Africa's greatest tourist attraction, and it is a highlight for many travelers.
In popular usage, a safari is a land-based expedition, especially to observe fascinating African wildlife in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and standard equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can best see them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "bush walk", "walking safari", or "walking") for a mobile safari can take a few hours or several days.
The 2021 Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo became the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, also hosting in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation before postponing them for 2020, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to be held.
Tickets for most areas cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average cost of ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them to dry. Even if not available in the room, most hotels can provide irons and ironing boards upon request.
If you don't have an iron, or if you dislike wearing wrinkled socks, you can try using a hair dryer.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (as it can shrink or, in extreme cases, warp).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, a minute is enough to boil water, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying sealed water issued by a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in the areas where they reside.
Pests can spoil food, cause pain, or cause severe conditions like allergies, spread poison, or cause infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals forcibly injuring or killing people, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods at certain locations where taxes and excise duties have been waived.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
Driving along the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, where isolated stretches of forest floor are constantly passed, there are severely challenging driving conditions in the area between Marion Point and Fairmont.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be aware of your skill level: roads with steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
Speed limits posted in the preceding and subsequent sections are significantly lower – typically 35-40 km/h (56-64 km/h) – and adhering to them is therefore even more important.
Intriguing as it is, the mobile phone service here is stronger than in many other strips along the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are just as rich and varied as in Austria, their southern neighbor.
Fruit pastries are abundant throughout the year with apple preparations in pastries, and they become even more delicious in the autumn with the addition of cherries and plums.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but flavorful pastries, turn to regions like Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made with a blend of herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
Yogurt is used extensively in curries in North Indian and Pakistani inland regions; coconut milk is used extensively in South India and other coastal regions of the peninsula.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a blanket term for the diverse regional food found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term primarily refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Today, Javanese cuisine, which is widely found throughout this archipelago, simply contains a wealth of experienced dishes, and the main flavorings of the Javanese are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various fragrant spices.
A stirrup is a strap that hangs on either side of a saddle and helps the rider support their feet.
They provide great stability for the rider, but can create safety issues by trapping the rider's feet.
If a rider falls off a horse and their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, and the horse continues to run, the rider can be dragged along. To minimize this risk, several precautionary measures can be taken.

The concept of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to as far as 5000 BC!
Sliding on snow from a hill has been a sport dating back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first snow sliding club in Australia as a recreational sport.
Skiing with equipment in a backpack, secured to the back: this is also known as ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related, but not usually in the context of alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on steeper terrain and requiring more robust ski equipment and boots.
Imagine a walkway of snow, similar to a pedestrian walkway.
You can cover more distance in good conditions, but you very rarely get the speed of snowshoeing between rural areas on well-maintained roads without large backpacks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has a large number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries means having to face visa applications and passport control processes multiple times.
However, the Shenzhen region, to some extent, operates as a single country in this regard.
As long as you are within this zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa eliminates the need to apply for visas to individual Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no common definition of what manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some customs officials define items older than 100 years as antiques.

As an example, American tourists in the Middle East may face different difficulties than Europeans and Arabs.
Travel advisories are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
Often, the ideas presented are hastily written, generic, and overly simplified information, when compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.

Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to maintain their privacy and dignity when going through scanners.
A rip current is a current that flows back out to sea, often formed by waves breaking on a beach and being deflected by a reef or similar structure.
Underwater topography causes upwelling to be concentrated in several deep sections, from where fast currents develop towards the deep sea.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion caused by attempting to swim against the current, which is a very difficult task.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back is not more difficult than usual.
Aim to go somewhere you won't be caught again, otherwise, depending on your skills and whether you've been seen, you may have to wait to be rescued.

Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the highest number of bases, with sixteen operational in 2020.
The archipelago is located about 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located, is the largest island.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, which boasts an excellent natural harbor formed by the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains merge into the plateau of the peninsula and re-emerge, forming a 360 km long chain of mountains in the Ellsworth Mountains, separated by the Minnesota Glacier.
The Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, located in its northern part, including Vinson Massif, which is 4892 meters high at Mount Vinson.
In rural areas with no mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a call.
This service is frequently used by shipping, leisure craft, and expeditions that have remote data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on connecting to this service.
A growingly popular option for gap year planners is learning through travel.

Finland is a fantastic boating destination. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," there are thousands of lakes and islands in the coastal archipelago.
You do not necessarily need a boat at the beaches and lakes.

Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with roughly one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This is also found in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise highly unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Many special Baltic cruises have extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend full days exploring the historic city and return to the ship each night to sleep.
You do not need a separate visa if you are only entering the country by land as part of your cruise (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and travel to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if one has never flown before or has faced a terrifying incident.

Courier companies get paid well for transporting goods quickly. Time is of the essence when it comes to things like business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Large companies have their own planes to travel certain routes, but other routes and smaller companies have issues here.
If they shipped the goods by air, it may take a few days for landing and customs clearance on some routes.
The only way to get it done faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that is where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel first class or business class is to pay more for the privilege (or have your company pay for it).
However, this isn't profitable: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times the average economy fare for business and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it's pointless to even check for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of flyers willing to pay a premium for the privilege of reaching their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. Its official language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken there.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
