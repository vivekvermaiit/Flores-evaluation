This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that was already widespread, but also provides details that fossils typically cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage has a light or carotenoid color on top with a chestnut brown color underneath.
Research also allows for a deeper understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but they did possess other feather characteristics such as barbs and barbules; researchers speculate that the rachis may have evolved after these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathers are similar to those of adults, but not like down feathers.
Researchers suggest that although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, it resembles old feathers, but not those from under a chicken.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but this program was written to treat the observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy as they are.
The effect the team is looking for occurs due to tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon causes tides in the oceans on Earth, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy influences the Milky Way.
Scientists were able to confirm that dark matter also affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
According to this theory, a galaxy is surrounded by a halo of dark matter, made up of very small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
In an interview, he said this new variant is "very disturbing and concerning due to its very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll suspects that some patients may have contracted an infection in the hospital, and that it may have spread to at least two healthcare workers.
In one year, a person with the disease will infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB still appears to be low in the overall TB-affected population; in South Africa, it affected 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 at any given time.

The first cases of the disease this season were reported in late July.
The disease spreads through pigs, which then infect humans through mosquitoes.
This explosion prompted the Indian government to deploy pig catchers and distribute thousands of mosquito nets and spray insecticides in the severely affected areas.
The government also promised several million vials of encephalitis vaccine, which will help prepare health agencies for the coming year.
Plans to distribute vaccines to historically most affected areas this year have been delayed due to funding shortages and lower priority compared to other diseases.

"Their thermal behavior isn't as consistently stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a steady temperature, though these are adapted to being deep pits in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a paper indicating their candidate choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identification, the voter deposits the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
The French electoral law precisely codifies the proceedings.
From 1988 onwards, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can directly see that there are no envelopes inside while voting, that the votes are counted correctly, and that no additional envelopes are added except for official voter envelopes.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of this process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following special procedures.

He initially joined the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekojo has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of his son's murder.
She is in custody while the indictment and trial are pending, but because her picture has been widely published, eyewitness testimony may be tainted.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently, and the courts have considered publishing photos as potential bias.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee stated, "Publishing photos of suspects makes it seem like journalists are treading a dangerous path."
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that it will not comment further until at least someone is charged.
According to the leaked document, it refers to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Regarding these reports, there's also the issue of Jerusalem's future status, sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley problem.
While Israel wants to continue military operations in the valley for 10 years after an agreement is reached, the PA has agreed to only 5 years of such operations.
Rangers must closely monitor the shooters in the attached insect control trial because the trial is being supervised and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., eligible volunteers were engaged under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
Following the Acting Director Park's succession of Mick O'Flynn in Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), formed yesterday with 9 members.
CEP formed as Martelly's member for the fifth consecutive time in the last 4 years.
As part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections, the President's Commission last month recommended the early resignation of the CEP.
This commission was established by Martelly in response to the anti-government protests that have been erupting since last October.
Sometimes, failure to hold elections leads to violent protests, some dating back to 2011.
60 cases have been reported of iPods failing due to overheating, including up to 6 incidents of fire and 4 minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 incidents of overheating, which the company is calling "non-serious."
The ministry described the postponement of the Apple report as "truly unfortunate."
An earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Office reported that the country suffered no damage.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no tsunami advisories.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took a busload of Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages were rescued, and at least 6 deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released like Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed the necessary lavatory. Mendoza was burned.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor in his spare time.
His research revealed that if the hormone could be controlled, it would accelerate the lung development of the fetal infant.
Xinhua reported that investigators on behalf of the government recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the original Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. She was unique and precious, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was weird like me.... even more so.... loving her and missing her... hopefully, she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled shared the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
Of those surveyed, 29 percent believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in 3 relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints against him, his fitness is doubtful.
Because he was banned from sports, he couldn't take the necessary medication to manage his pain.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
In early February, several people verified the invention using various hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water supply to Earth, along with organic matter that forms proteins and aids in the existence of life.
Scientists are trying to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Earlier this year, 53-year-old Cuomo secured his governorship and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and rubbish".
It was expected that he would compete for the presidential post in 2016.
The FAA claims the NextGen system, which allows aircraft to travel shorter distances, saves millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduces carbon emissions.
Air traffic controllers use satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-radar based technology, to pinpoint aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport, and Overground trains will not stop near Wembley. Also, car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at the ground.
Fears about the lack of transportation have created the possibility of playing the game behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday revealed the establishment of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that these new species emerged in just two generations, contrary to the belief that the process would take much longer, due to predicted interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant, the Cocos finch Pinaroloxias inornata.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, and it can be wrapped and knotted. It can be flattened with a hammer or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adheres to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be prepared using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline (basic).
pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electron removed (since hydrogen atoms contain 1 proton and 1 electron).
Combine the two powders, then with clean, damp hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands combines with the outer layers of skin, affecting them and making it look strange, almost like a shell.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced drainage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities in Greece, such as Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women mingled together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket, 100 feet tall, to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel changed the world in an amazing way. The biggest thing the wheel did for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
This has brought us trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Underneath them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey like rabbits, and also blackbuck and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that prey on various small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a unique job for each cat, ensuring none compete with the others.
Lions are highly social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Groups are formed with thirty female lions and cubs, together with 1 to 3 male lions.
Being a large family consisting of sisters and daughters, female animals are generally closely related to each other.
Lions, like packs of wolves or dogs, are animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior (but not other big cats), and yet work together to be very deadly for their prey.
A well-rounded athlete can climb a tiger (even if not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times with the strength of a strong man.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same group (genus Panthera). These are the only four cats that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's roar that is filled with throaty sounds; it roars loudly, like a statement filled with voice.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if possible. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots locate animals to eat (food) by scent, detecting the scent where they have been on the ground.
They have night vision, allowing them to see well even in the dark, and they move silently without making noise. Ocelots blend into their surroundings, stalk their prey, and then pounce on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population (perhaps by crossing a mountain range or a river, or if they travel to a new island and can't easily return), they may find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment will have diverse resources and competitors, so the new population will require different features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it needed to be before.
The population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they will start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of the evolutionary process.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants use photosynthesis to make food from sunlight. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals cannot survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, fearing nothing except perhaps other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are fitted with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, ensuring nothing that crosses its path has a chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and even other mosasaurs, and it may have also been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like a T. rex would be no match for it.
Although we know a great deal about the Roman diet, the Romans enjoyed novel or unusual delicacies in their food such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, the rich preferred to eat feasts together.
Ancient Roman meals did not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had never tasted corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and an ancient Roman would never have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the abode of that god.
People offer sacrifices to the deities, and priests try to satisfy the needs of the deities through rituals and festivals.
Every temple had an outer temple courtyard and an inner sanctum/garbha gudi that only priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, sometimes called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
There is a special sacred place for God at the top of the tower.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house is not that important.
Many in the Hebrew family lived their lives outdoors.
The women cooked in the backyard. The shops were just open counters. Stone was used for building houses.
Since there were no large forests in Canaan, wood was very expensive there.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and subsequently, while traveling west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of what he discovered, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Even though every country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Even though something is written on the back of the paper, it's not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The words appear upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows who wrote it, it has been known about for a long time, a large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) rolled up for storage.
Therefore, a notation may simply be attached as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
This was under the "Vichy" French regime. They made peace with the Germans in 1940 and, instead of fighting them, collaborated with the occupiers.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces attacked southern France, and this invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just 2 weeks, American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a society, a significantly large group that coexists and works together.
The word 'civilization' comes from the Latin civilis, which pertains to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it can also, to some extent, define the size of a society.
City-states were the precursors to countries. Civilization implies the transmission of knowledge to many generations, the equal dissemination of long-lasting cultural identities, and culture.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving a relevant historical record and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states—with Congress as their sole unifying body—initially established a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress does not have the power to levy taxes. As it did not have a national executive and judiciary, it depended on government officials.
It also does not have the power to abolish tax laws and duties between states.
Consensus from all states is necessary before amending these articles. The central government's representatives were frequently absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), with Japan standing as the 7th largest island country in the world.
Due to its archipelago/group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago."
In the 15th century, Taiwan's beginnings here saw European sailors record the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu mainly has 3 structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists an idea of what they were actually like.
By 1976, thirty percent of the Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration has continued to this day.
For example, the most common still-image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was also the dominant motion picture size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format is said to be 3:2 (after dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and mocked, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
The most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become elevated and powerful, came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity has bound European countries together for a thousand years.
Its vast power affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian traditions is that wealth should be used to eradicate suffering and poverty, and for that reason, community funds are special.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for a thousand years, and this authority and money have led many to question whether this fulfills the doctrine.
Britain began to blockade Germany as soon as hostilities broke out.
Despite violating generally accepted international law, codified by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries, this disruption, by curtailing crucial military and civilian supplies, has proven to be an effective strategy.
The discovery of international waters by Britain, intended to prevent ships from entering certain sections of the sea, also endangered neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this maneuver, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare tactic.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were very strong policies for many citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors of World War II, nations desired to ensure that such a situation would never arise again in the future.
Tesla went to the United States in 1884 to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the US with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods; each phase or ruling family in China was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, the territories belonging to each dynasty have been divided over the years. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, a fierce battle took place between many lords fighting for the throne.
In ancient Chinese history, the Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras, with thousands dying in Xi'an fighting for the throne of the Grand Palace.
There were many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to democratic principles, and the belief in nationalism and that the country belonged not only to the ruler but also to the people.
After the revolution, opening up professions to all male applicants allows for the most prestigious and successful careers.
Even from the army, it's the same, meaning instead of the rankings that came from within the army, they are now relying on Kailabu.
The French Revolution also inspired many working-class people in other countries who were subjected to oppression.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He would often go to a cave for meditation on Mount Noor, which is called Hira.
This cave, with its thousands of years of history, clearly reflects the spiritual aspects of Muhammad.
Located in the mountains north of Mecca, this cave on top of it was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, even if someone knew it existed, finding it wouldn't be that easy. Once you go inside the cave, you are completely alone.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding the area. The outside world is barely visible from inside the cave, and sounds are barely audible.
The Great Pyramid of Giza remains one of the Seven Wonders of the world.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
This great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built honoring Khufu's wives and family members.
The "Up Bow" mark looks like a V, and the "Down Bow" mark appears as a bold line or a rectangle missing its bottom side.
That means you should start at the up position and draw the bow, and on the way down you should start at the nock (which is where you hold the bow in your hand) and release the bow.
The sound produced when the instrument's string is plucked upwards is gentle, while the sound produced when the string is plucked downwards is powerful and more robust.
Keep the pencil loosely in your own staves, remembering, however, that printed accidentals belong to the measure in which they occur, and should be normally observed.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) to return to Paris from Versailles.
As the crowd gathered around, shouting and threatening the King and Queen, they fled back to Paris in a horse-drawn carriage.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their horse-drawn carriage open.
Once upon a time, in Versailles, a man from the crowd shook the head of a Royal Guard who had been killed in front of the terrified queen.
The U.S. government's war expenses in the victory over the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial administration to cover the main portion of expenses and to settle interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
The excessive profits gained from this long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute a primary source of profit for the U.S. government.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the Order.
The period in which these events occurred is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The tradition ends around 1500, with the Early Middle Ages preceding the High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages following.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, implying the notion that human destiny stems from technological advancement or necessity, inspired by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their expression.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common notions: that technological development follows a path independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology has impacts on societies that are socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, therefore new production methods will be developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning more cars leads to more accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to new innovations in the medical field for repairing injured bodies in healthcare.
Romanticism has a significant cultural dimension in its determinations, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
From a Romanticism perspective, people were geographically molded, but over time, those geographical customs and cultures were formed, which were better than the unilaterally imposed laws that suited the social conditions of the time.
Just as France is considered the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Known as a center of luxury, its name originated around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the 12th century as the warrior clans returned gifts of silk fabrics and spices of greater value than the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was during this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries, reaching its peak in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West might lag behind for 25 to 30 years.
The people of Western Europe began developing their own style in the late Middle Ages. One of the biggest developments of that time, resulting from the religious wars, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture is practiced to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is often inherently organic, employing techniques like crop rotation, saving seeds adapted to the region, and other simple methods to maximize yields.
Historically, many farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who are neglected by mainstream social norms and share a common sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture distinctively can be a combination of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, and geographical aspects or factors.
Members of a subculture express their membership through a distinct and stylized code, encompassing trends, practices, and jargon.
One of the most common approaches used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on cases of "feral children"—children who, through neglect, misfortune, or severe abuse, grow up largely unsocialized, displaying unfortunate and often disturbing behaviors.
Such children are called "undisciplined" or cruelly behaving children. Some undisciplined children are ostracized by people (often their own parents); in some cases, these children are abandoned because parents reject a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have been subjected to severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
There are allegations of others being raised by animals; some appear to have lived on their own in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child will exhibit almost entirely the behaviors of that specific caregiving animal (within physical limitations), such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the support provided by the instructor takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather provides a tool to support individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both hypothetical and real; in other words, a teacher can be thought of as a type of scaffold, like the little paperclip person that appears in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to query, prompt, and explain processes that would be challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should have to go without nourishment, care, and the opportunity to grow educationally, but they do.
We learned that the foster care system should be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
All previously purchased household essentials must be provided as Foster Toys.
The internet combines mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional uses and satisfaction methods.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been identified as key motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Igbaria and MacLeod (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational factors when researching audience reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial movements, which last for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, whether a person is lying or not can be found out by subtly observing their expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech," pointed out how individuals with brain damage, who are unable to understand speech, can still assess sincerity, even in the most honest of people.
He also suggested that such abilities to understand human behavior might even be shared by animals like pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that genetic variation exists in two forms: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
With each generation, the separation and reunification of two groups shifts diversity back and forth.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a mammal with a human-like digestive system to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
Proteins found in leaves and nuts are the most readily available plant sources for us, but they are difficult for people like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high quantity of proteins containing essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, it wouldn't be surprising if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees today forage on the green pastures.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
You can make this easier by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to rouse you gently, rather than abruptly, bringing you to consciousness more gradually.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing a person to urinate.
The inner peace within a person is interconnected with the stress in their body and soul.
The less stress you have, the more positive life energy you will have. Every person has the ability to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded through the Mahayana path of love and many practices from Indian yoga.
Theoretically, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through Kundalini yoga with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Tibet is the center for meditation and divine union. Energy pathways are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is created through the visualization of various deities.
In World War II, Germany became an enemy to everyone, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. As the war ended, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries splitting apart.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
This will continue for the next 40 years, with proxy armies engaging in real combat in war zones from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other regions, marking the beginning.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already crumbled, with the Romanian Bridgehead remaining the only hope for regrouping and falling back.
Regardless, the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts were created after a plan was implemented overnight, and 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large groups of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of navies is to ensure your country has the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, where Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
During that time, the German Navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
With its relationships with allied nations failing, Germany would probably have brought Britain under its control, just like the rest of the countries in Europe.
Goats are believed to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping milk, hair, meat, and skins in a way that made them readily available.
Typically, domestic goats were kept in herds in hilly or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds or adolescents, much like the more familiar shepherds who often tended sheep. These methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the carts were only made of wooden planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads on roads that were slightly rougher than before.
Cross ties were introduced very early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that tracks would be more effective if iron ore was present on top.
This became a common practice, but it caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the iron carts.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. The first complete iron rails were introduced in 1767.
He knew it was initially locomotion, humans began walking upright with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man) 2 million years ago.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal adaptations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental movement, and even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is often like symptomatic treatment. However, if you don't just want a temporary solution, you need to find the root cause of the problems and deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of mankind, and problems have further intensified due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of mankind.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson signed the handwritten draft and sent it to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made that night, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
On July 8th, John Nixon publicly read this document related to the Declaration of Independence for the first time in the Independence Hall Yard.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlop broadsides still in existence are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today; we call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet with claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
In fact, all computers currently in use rely on the exchange of information coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits when using computer terminology.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately obvious. It may present with common symptoms like vomiting, so we cannot diagnose it right away.
The best indication of internal poisoning is the presence of an open medication container or poisonous household chemicals.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions appropriate for the poison.
Entomologists traditionally use the term "bug" for this group of insects.
This term originates from the ancient association with bed bugs, which are well adapted to living as parasites on humans.
Both long-legged and blood-sucking insects belong to a class of completely undeveloped parasites that live in nests or establish themselves on the bodies of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may choose to conceive a child for their own well-being or in the best interest of their child.
This couple may choose the adoption process for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is a guide for many scientific researches.
Even though this is not done in isolation, experimentation, as well as an experiment, is a test that guides scientific research to eliminate one or more hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations.
Natural scientists, philosophers, traditional texts, and especially the Bible in Latin, were the focus of attention.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all subjects of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, Westerners became detached from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often dependent on the existence and production of endogenous cycles by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic cues, have been recorded for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, maintaining free-running cyclical rhythms even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the prominent experiments that demonstrated DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, marking the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have diverse effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring; mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in enjoying natural landscapes, including flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting Borneo, taking photos, and learning about orangutans.
Every morning, people drive to work in cars from their small towns and encounter those who work there.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supporting a private car-dependent transportation system.
Science tells us that this massive carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of the stable states that helped human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is a stakeholder in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
You rarely hear complaints of this magnitude in developed countries regarding water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems have such complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the drivers behaved within a reasonably stable range; therefore, it can be mathematically approximated that the traffic streams possess some reasonable stability.
Relationships were established between three key characteristics to effectively represent traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections aid in the planning, design, and operation of road transportation facilities.
Insects are the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly has helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back along with their body.
This allows them to hide in small spaces extensively, protecting themselves from carnivores.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought what he was saying was correct, but many people believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the sun, revolved around the earth (and other stars as well).
This seems intelligent, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon, flowing at a width of 6 miles, is the widest river on Earth.
20 percent of the water that flows from all the rivers on Earth into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building continued until the demise of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in their size and the technological excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by their own older monuments, structures that were then already more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also a common daily language used by many working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious celebrations.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these can be found in their natural form in nature and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theoretically proved that each of the four elements—earth, water, air, and fire—is composed of a mixture of one or more of these elements.
It is like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are primarily a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are very small; trillions of them could fit inside the periods at the end of this sentence.
In that way, the pencil is a good friend to many when it comes out.
Poor thing, it has been reduced to a small scale and limited uses due to the advent of new writing methods.
People are now typing messages on computer screens, and they never come near a pencil sharpener anymore.
Someone might wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes out.
A fission bomb works on the principle of the energy required to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's like rolling a huge boulder up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, meaning they decay spontaneously without any or very little prompting.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick near the center and 100 km thick farther from the center.
It is thin under Maria and thick under Highlands.
The thinness of the crust suggests there might be more maria nearby. Lava could rise more easily.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates individuals to tick or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that individuals have specific needs and/or desires that are intrinsic by the time they reach adulthood.
These theories explain how certain individuals are motivated to desire the things they do and what circumstances around them cause them to perform or refrain from performing specific actions.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two well-known content theories.
Typically, when managers start leading their former peers, two behaviors emerge from them. One side is an attempt to be "one of the guys" (or girls) to maintain their previous image.
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, analyzing performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes unrecognizable, feeling the need to change everything the team is doing and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is solely responsible for the team's defeat or victory.
This behavior often leads to divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Fictional teams are just as skilled as traditional teams, except for a few minor differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones that their local managers don't understand.
The existence of a true "phantom team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" is a management team to which every member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? The goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources within a company's functional departments are utilized effectively, innovation and transformative creativity can be delivered.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle leads to a new creative process that serves the need of the consumer.
Before an organization can be creative, leadership must cultivate a culture of creativity, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method that helps organizational performance reach a higher level.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows and refines the area of research.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientific research.
It has been known for a long time that various kinds of damage like brain injuries, psychological distress, and tumors affect mental state and cause changes in behavior.
New technologies allow us to see and further investigate brain structures and processes in ways never seen before.
This provides us with the necessary information and material to create several simulation models in order to understand the various kinds of processes in our brain.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, encompassing behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI is immersed in creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
For example, controlling, planning, setting up, resolving customer queries and issues, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
Such things have become special behaviors, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Just as AI systems are now built into many home computer and video game software applications, they are frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Quite often a teacher prefers to take her students to places where a bus ride is the only option.
Virtual field trips offer a technological solution, allowing students to view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art, all from the comfort of their classroom.
Virtually sharing a field trip to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes is a great way.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and while the website is modified each year, the old versions are kept online so students can review them when needed.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Students often start their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling; however, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts working on improving their writing to avoid criticism.
Similarly, blogging compels students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to feed the audience's interest inspires and engages students (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to learn beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs empowers students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings and articulate their own perspectives on specific issues (Orewerek, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and boasts a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
It is home to the unparalleled beauty of Niagara Falls in the far south and Muskoka in the north, and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario in a way that outsiders would perceive as Canadian.
The large regions in the north have very low populations, with some being almost uninhabited wilderness.
To illustrate the surprising population comparison: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar remains the largest continent to itself so far.
Most small islands are either independent nations, associated with France, or known for luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to their regions, and it took a long time to reach Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is advisable for all women travelers to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be useful (besides just looking expensive).
Women should realize that due to cultural differences, actions like following someone, holding hands, etc., which might be considered harassment, are not uncommon.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to be steadfast in your intentions (regardless of cultural differences, if it doesn't feel right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casablanca, only abandoning it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Beida, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, one can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, pottery, leather goods, and hookahs, but this is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located east of Rwanda.
In 2002, much of the town of Goma's streets, especially the town center, were destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried them.
While Goma itself is somewhat safe, to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province, one needs to ask someone who has traveled outside of Goma.
This city serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a "boda-boda" (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. A typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu," with its relative remoteness, has been used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, yet its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was also included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat of desert sand.
That is a featured location in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic style than an African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
This park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each harboring unique wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, the park has daily conservation and entrance fees.
It is advantageous to purchase a Wild Card that grants access to some parks in South Africa, or even all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory and is a major tourist hub.
Hong Kong's skyline of skyscraper buildings resembles a sparkling bar chart made even more vivid by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
A large portion of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated along the northern coast and on reclaimed land.
This is the place the British colonists adopted as their own, and if you are looking for the colonial roots of the country, this is the right place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest littoral mangrove belt, extending about 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast across Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans are declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The forest area within the Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
These mangrove forests are not just wetlands – they hold remnants of powerful forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans mangrove forests cover an area of 3,850 km², about one-third of which is covered by water/mud.
The Sundarbans forest has been a sanctuary for animals since 1966, and it is now estimated to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (riverside) throughout the day, however, the majority, especially those going towards the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it's best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable, sturdily built, and long-lasting.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers is up to 83 meters. It is 378 meters long and has two lenses with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't open to traffic until March 2017.
This bridge, which is expected to complete Brazilian customs checkpoints, is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017.
The Guaraní are currently the most important indigenous group living in eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is also home to other indigenous groups like the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who subsist by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of the confrontation between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous Guaraní groups.
The Spanish initiated a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537 in Asunción, Paraguay has largely been able to maintain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known as one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Check out Argentina De Polo for news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in the Stanley Islands, from FIC West Store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and even United States dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards are not accepted in the surrounding islands, however, they are likely to accept British and United States currency; inquire with the owners there beforehand about what payment methods they are using.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it experiences summer when the Northern Hemisphere experiences winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in summer, temperatures above +30°C are common in this region.
During winter, the intensity of cold here is very high: temperatures rarely reach freezing point, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the temperature shown on the thermometer.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
However cruel they may appear, they can prey on almost all large animals, including bison, elk, moose, and bears.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't stay at a safe distance. These animals are large, ferocious, and dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition to this, smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and maintain a clean campsite.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. This town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was an infamous naval base in 1889 when seven ships from Germany and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
The Paramount Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed as a result of a peaceful gathering in the town during the Mau movement's independence struggle.
Auckland has many beaches due to being sheltered by 2 harbours. The most popular beaches are in 3 areas.
The northern coastal beaches (in the Northern Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all these sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most have the shade of Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive is home to beaches at Waitmata Harbour, Mission Bay in central Auckland, and the suburbs of St Heliers.
These are sometimes crowded beaches with families and have good shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer here is 'Number One'; it's not a good beer, but it's refreshing and invigorating. Another local beer here is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black 'espresso' is served, as is cappuccino with cream (not froth), and tea without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but exquisite.
The reef is visited by many tourists throughout the year, and injuries on the reef are very rare due to these reasons.
Even so, take the advice of officials, provide all instructions, and carefully observe safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and in riverine areas as far north as 1770 from October to April. They occasionally appear outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the riverbank north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows travelers to sleep peacefully anywhere after reaching their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
If there are any corrections or requests, please go through the travel agent first, and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most of those attending music festivals decide to camp on site, and many tourists consider this an essential experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll want to get there early to get a campsite closer to the music.
Even though the music stops on the main stages, music continues to be played in some sections of the festival until midnight.
Some festivals have special camps for families with young children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as traversing the ice can cause a very unpleasant sound for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises offer time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the regulations).
Casinos typically make many attempts to maximize the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits are difficult to find.
Typically, guests at an event are offered special food, drinks, and entertainment options to keep them happy and engaged, encouraging them to stay.
Some venues are offering alcoholic drinks on the house. However, drinking impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone traveling at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snowstorms, ice, or freezing temperatures and plan their trips accordingly.
On roads covered with snow and ice, there is low traction and you cannot drive as you would on clear asphalt.
During blizzards, so much snow can fall in such a short time that you can get stranded on the road.
Visibility may also be poor due to snowfall, blowing snow, or ice or frost forming on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, many countries typically experience cold and snowy conditions, and traffic flows smoothly throughout the year without disruption.
Safaris are a major tourist attraction in Africa and are important to many visitors.
In popular usage, the word safari refers to an overland journey, especially in the savanna, to view the magnificent African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to cars and standard equipment, which allows for a good view.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs are sometimes shy, and you can see them even better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") can involve walking for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies may have changed, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies were not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled, by the end of March.
Event tickets typically cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with general tickets priced at 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry faster. Many hotels offer an iron and ironing board on loan, even if there isn't one in the room.
If iron is not available, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using your available hair dryer.
Be careful not to let the clothes get too hot (as this can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are various ways to purify water, some working more effectively against specific contaminants.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, a few minutes are necessary.
Filters become effective, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them and not found in their home areas.
Pests spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Communicable diseases occur spontaneously, or dangerous animals that injure or forcibly kill people do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain areas.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont has very challenging driving conditions, as it passes through desolate backwoods terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be aware: steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp curves dominate.
Posted speed limits are often much lower than those of preceding and subsequent sections—typically 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is important; otherwise, accidents may occur.
Interestingly, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in other places, such as the Pennsylvania forests.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, much like in Austria, their southern neighbor.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being baked into pastries year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often paired well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, depending on the region they are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Kura is a dish made with herbs and spices, and it can be combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In northern India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
To encompass 17,000 islands, the Indonesian food umbrella term embraces the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualifiers, the term refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features seasonal dishes, Javanese-adapted flavors of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
Stirrups provide support for the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
These provide the rider with more stability, but there are safety concerns as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them while running. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, very narrow sole.
Later, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to slip off the saddle if a fallen rider is dragged by the stirrup.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts a variety of granite big walls and crags.
The summits offer breathtaking views from peak to peak. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among its endless walls.
Downhill snowsports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding across snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations for skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing has been recognized as a sport since the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was started in 1861 by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking via skis: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
That doesn't require, but is usually associated with, alpine-style climbing, ski touring, or mountaineering; the latter two occur on steeper terrain and require skis and boots that are not as rigid.
Think of a skiing route in the same way you would a hiking route.

Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
However, the Schengen Zone is uniquely special in this regard.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each country within the Schengen area. This saves time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition of manufactured goods as antiques. Some tax organizations define items older than 100 years as antiques.

Advisors can only provide a brief summary of the political situation in any country.
The views presented are often incomplete, generalized, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.

Rip currents are currents flowing away from the beach, formed by waves breaking, often near a reef or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated at certain deep sections, and deep water forms there, away from the rapidly flowing current.
Many deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim against seemingly impossible currents.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.

Here, peninsular mountains merge into a plateau and re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, transacted by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains Antarctica's highest mountains, including the Vinson Massif, which is near Mount Vinson at 4892 meters.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a phone call.
This service is frequently used for shipping, pleasure craft, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.

Finland is a great boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands, along with lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in islands and lakes.
Coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes truly offer a diverse experience, whether by boat, smaller boats, or a kayak.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime, with about 1 in every 7 or 8 people owning a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, the ratio is as high as one to forty).

Courier companies are well-paid to deliver goods quickly. Often, time is of the essence with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
In some ways, large companies have their own planes, but in other ways smaller organizations have a problem.
If they sent the goods by air freight, it would take days to get them through unloading and customs on some routes.
The only way to get it quickly is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow sending luggage without the passenger who owns it being present.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to fork out a hefty wad for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: as a rule, you have to pay four times the regular economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class.
Generally, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that a specific core group of flyers is willing to pay top dollar to get anywhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
