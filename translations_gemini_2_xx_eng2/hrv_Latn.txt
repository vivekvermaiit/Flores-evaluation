This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but provides details that fossils usually do not, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper side of this animal's feathers was chestnut brown, while the underside was pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather features—barbs and barbules—researchers have concluded that the shaft likely arose later in evolution than these other features.
Based on the feather structure, it can be concluded that it was not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers claim that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage color of adult specimens, not the down of juveniles.
The research showed that despite being a young dinosaur's tail, the sample features plumage coloration of an adult bird, not chick fluff.
A car bomb exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.
The governor's office reports that nineteen police officers were among the injured.
Police said they suspect a purported member of the militant group Daesh (ISIS) is responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun is governed by the same fundamental principles that govern other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is determined solely by their luminosity and rotation.
A star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow, is determined using luminosity and rotation.
The smaller the Rossby number, the lower the star's activity in terms of magnetic reversal.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was supposed to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was aiming for is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have proven that dark matter affects other dark matter just like ordinary matter does.
According to that theory, most of the dark matter around galaxies forms a kind of halo around the galaxy, which consists of numerous small particles.

"The warmth of the pits isn't as uniform as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent in that they are large openings in the ground," says Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, high technology is traditionally not used in voting: voters are isolated in booths, where they insert a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
The procedure is very strictly prescribed by French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that they contain no envelopes at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added to them except those cast by properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers, under strict supervision, count the votes following specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated, "We have arrested five people suspected of raping a Swiss woman, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants arrived at court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services are extracting the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, charged with the murder of her son.
She is awaiting indictment and trial in custody, but there is a possibility that eyewitness evidence will be derivative because many media outlets have published her photograph.
This is standard practice throughout the United Kingdom, but the justice system in Scotland operates differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photographs potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists are walking a dangerous tightrope by publishing photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Attorney's Office, which leads all criminal proceedings, announced to reporters that it would not be making any further comments at least until an indictment is filed.
According to leaked information, the document will concern the border dispute, with Palestine wanting the borders to be based on those prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to all three peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
Hunters in a trial hunt aimed at controlling pests would be under strict supervision of park rangers who would monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the hunt.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, as part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage for the park at NPWS, the four marksmen selected to carry out the initial cull operation received extensive safety guidelines and underwent training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday at the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission cited the previous resignation of the CEO as part of a package of measures towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sometimes, violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections that should have been held since 2011.
Around 60 cases of defective iPods overheating have been reported, which caused six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry stated that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company deemed "not serious."
The Ministry called Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands reported that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired a shot at the tourists from his M16 rifle.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an older woman who had to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the application of hormones accelerates the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two flight data recorders from the "black box".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two months. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnells stated "Luna was just as weird as me, if not more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's gone to a better place."
Of the 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposing the proposal for Australia to become a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey participants share the same view and believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle races, as well as three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his health is now in question due to complaints.
He couldn't take painkillers because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known as of January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was published on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of the emergence of water on Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are interested in how planets form, especially how Earth formed, with which comets collided long ago.
Cuomo's (53) term began earlier this year, and the governor signed a bill into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
It is assumed that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would allow for shortening aircraft flight routes, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older radar-based technology, this system uses satellite technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transportation options organized, and overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley. Also, car parking facilities and park and ride options at ground level will not be available.
Due to fears of a lack of transportation, the possibility has emerged that the match may have to be moved indoors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species have evolved within just two generations, although it was believed that the process takes much longer, due to crossbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant finch from the genus Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and stick to other metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
That is called chemical pH. Red cabbage juice can be your indicator.
The brine changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the pH abbreviation) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, and the reaction will tickle you and cause a cocoon to form.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, every house was equipped with at least one flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the structures of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mixed in society.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a signal and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists in space use telescopes because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and view.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket over 100 feet tall.
The wheel brought unimaginable changes to the world. The biggest change was that the invention of the wheel enabled much easier and faster transportation.
He enabled the invention of the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are mid-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat a far greater number of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the niche concept, that is, the specific position each cat occupies, so they don't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also highly lethal to their prey.
As a complete athlete, a tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump a great distance, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Panthera genus) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like a series of incomprehensible, shouted words.
Ocelots eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find the animals they eat (prey) by scent, by sniffing where the prey has moved on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and move very stealthily in the dark. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings and then ambushing them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, during a crossing over a mountain or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment.
A new environment means different resources and different competition, so the new population needs traits or adaptations that differ from previous ones in order to compete for resources.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different in appearance that they will no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and then take in carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants create food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
We make houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw held over 70 sharp teeth along with an additional set on the palate, meaning there was no help for anyone who crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible it had a forked tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may have also been a cannibal.
It would attack anything that entered the water; even enormous dinosaurs like T. rex would have been no match for it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or uncommon delicacies that included wild boar, peacocks, snails, and dormice.
The second difference was that the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, while wealthy men enjoyed communal feasts where they would dine reclining on their sides.
The meals of ancient Romans could not have contained ingredients that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they didn't know corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's house.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramids shaped like towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a particularly sacred shrine.
In the warm climatic conditions of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of Hebrew families took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were counters open to the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red, after being banished from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his way west and gave it that name.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not correct. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it said "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote this large document on parchment (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches), but it is known that it was rolled up for storage soon after it was made.
So, that record was probably added simply as a marker.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
They were ruled by the French from "Vichy France." These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked together with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France. The attack is known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together – a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word "civilis," meaning civil, which refers to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, which also defines the size of society in a way.
City-states are the precursors to states. Civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation, a mark in culture, and equal dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, so we don't recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government consisting only of Congress through the constitutional act of the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no executive or judicial authority, it relied on competent bodies for the implementation of all acts, which often did not cooperate.
He also did not have the authority to abolish tax laws and customs duties between states.
A unanimous consent of all states was required to amend the Agreement, and the states did not take the central government seriously, so their representatives were most often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful team in the world, and they were champions at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Since it consists of a cluster (group) of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan's history begins as early as the 15th century, when European sailors, while sailing along the island, recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan and initiated the transformation of Aboriginal grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took over the administration of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing dynasty Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 - 1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better introduction to how they were originally created.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced to this day, but more importantly, digital cameras use the same aspect ratio for their image sensors.
It's a bit confusing that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to express the ratio as simple whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, formats from the APS group) are equal to or very close to this image aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often broken and mocked, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a certain order in the image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church became a subject of criticism.
For over a thousand years, Christianity connected European states that had different languages and customs.
The immense power of Christianity influenced everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and reduce poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they adhere to that principle.
Soon after the outbreak of armed conflict, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy worked because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in multiple international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, creating a danger even for neutral ships.
Given that there was not much interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a pacifist attitude and detachment prevailed among the majority of citizens and peoples.
Having experienced horrors and atrocities during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation repeating itself in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (foreman at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that was in power was a recognizable dynasty.
Between each dynasty followed an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms epoch, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars took place among the nobles in the struggle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history; thousands died fighting for the highest position in the great Xi'an palace.
The consequences are of a social and political nature, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not the ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, employment was available to all men, and the most ambitious and successful were given the opportunity to succeed.
The same applied to the military, because after the revolution, ranks were obtained based on ability, not class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in questions beyond the confines of his boring life. He would visit the cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) so that he could think better.
The cave that has survived through history provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not at all easy to find even if you know for sure that it exists. Once you find yourself in the cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear, beautiful sky and many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists.
The Pyramid of Cheops, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu's wives and members of his family.
The "up-bow" marking looks like a V, and the "down-bow" marking looks like a staple or a square without its bottom side.
The "up" bow marking means to start at the tip and push the bow, and the "down" bow marking means to start at the frog (where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
A raised bow usually creates a softer sound, while a lowered bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the bowings are printed for musical reasons and should usually be adhered to.
A frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister Elizabeth were forced by a mob of women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the mob swung the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipinos themselves paid for the American imperialist war expenses in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the costs, and interest on the bonds was transacted through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profit derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos will form the basic profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order was created.
We usually call the era of these events the High Middle Ages, which is the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from technological impetus or technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely above cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, not socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the invention of the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a road network throughout the entire country is not cost-effective for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass car ownership leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the discovery of new techniques in healthcare for treating injuries.
In Romanticism, there was a strong element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time customs and culture arise linked to geography that are in accordance with the physical dwelling place of society, and are therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from 400 AD to approximately 1100 AD.
The situation deteriorated in the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style was in the period from the 10th to the 11th century and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest discoveries of that era, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons on clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses seeds native to the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, which is still true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that make a subculture distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often display their belonging through a recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is citing examples of unfortunate cases of children who did not undergo socialization by adults during their upbringing, whether as a result of neglect, accident, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called uncultured or feral. Some feral children are held captive by people (most often their own parents). In some cases, abandonment of a child is a result of parents' rejection of their child having a severe intellectual or mental impairment.
Feral children may experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are presumed to have been raised by animals, and some reportedly lived in the wild on their own.
If a feral child has been raised entirely by animals, they will exhibit behaviors (within bodily limitations) that almost completely mimic those of the animal that raised them, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should facilitate learning and make it more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding, i.e., providing support, is not an educational method, but rather support for individuals facing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, as is the animated paperclip that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and is intended for testing, directing, and explaining procedures that a learner might find too challenging to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even coercion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, yet it still happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is obligated to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should meet all the needs that are lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of usage and access.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motives for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
When researching visitor reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video has enabled important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to discern whether a particular person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "President's Speech," argues that people who cannot understand speech due to brain injury can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He implied that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genetic variations: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation transfer variability between these two sources.
In the savanna, primates with digestive systems similar to humans struggle to meet their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Indeed, failure has serious consequences: lower growth, poor nutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest uncooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also contains large amounts of protein that include all essential amino acids.
"All things considered, it shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors solved the ""protein intake question"" in almost the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna do today."
Sleep fragmentation is the practice of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then going back to sleep shortly after (10–60 minutes).
That's possible with the simple use of a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking up.
If you realize you're turning off your alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which will force you to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the life force present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can experience enlightenment. The only thing standing in our way to that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga awakens kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Divine yoga is at the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, differences in systems, procedures, and cultures led to hostility between the two countries.
Two years before the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last the next 40 years and be fought by truly empowered armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans collapsed almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered Poland and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after invading the eastern Polish regions, thus violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ship is certainly the most efficient way for a large number of people and a large quantity of goods to cross the ocean.
The role of a navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to transport manpower and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures, and they were guarded by so-called "kozari", usually children or adolescents, which is the name for shepherds who guard goats. These livestock methods are still used today.
Rails for wagons pulled by horses were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden rails for wagons consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed horses pulling wagons to move faster and haul heavier loads than would have been possible on the somewhat bumpier roads of that time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails could be more efficient with iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden ones. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (upright man) appeared.
Their ancestors, australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedalism appears in australopithecines around 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even be activists to somewhat reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, it's like treating the symptoms. However, if we are not looking for a solution that is only temporary, we must find the root of these problems and neutralize them.
It is obvious that the world has changed significantly thanks to the scientific and technological advancement of mankind, and the problems are growing due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles.
After Congress adopted the handwritten draft on July 4th, which was signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, it was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap copies known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many don't perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many features of birds resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that poison.
Entomologists use the term beetle in an official sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the well-known bed bugs, insects that have adapted very well to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and common bed bugs depend on their hosts, in whose nests or living spaces they live.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a newborn is not in their best interest or the best interest of their child.
Such couples can put their child up for adoption.
In adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. This method is essentially a guideline for most scientific research.
Besides that method, experimentation, that is, experiments that represent tests for eliminating one or more possible hypotheses, posing questions, and observation also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West severed ties with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Numerous recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not just a response to external cyclical stimuli, have been discovered in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence suggesting that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments that indicated phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a multitude of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether germline cells are affected.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on location include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and drive to work, while those whose work destination is the place they just left pass by them.
In this dynamic transportation scenario, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this cumbersome carbon economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rare.
Why are transport systems the cause of so many complaints; why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something much bigger at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they achieve with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave relatively consistently, so traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
For a better representation of traffic flow, the relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Several thousand years ago, Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were convinced of the opposite - that the Solar System, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times the water of the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the collapse of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and technical excellence of the pyramids at Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of the Vatican is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also an everyday language used by the majority of those working in the country, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is made up of one or a mixture of more than four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys may also exist that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil quickly became a close companion to a large number of people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the pencil has lost its status and is used less and less.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they don't even need a pencil sharpener.
We can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fusion bomb works on the principle of taking energy to assemble a nucleus with numerous protons and neutrons.
It's roughly like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with a slight nudge or even without one.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust's thickness is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner in the lunar maria regions and thicker in the highlands regions.
There might be more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner. Lava reached the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with maturation and growing up.
These theories explore what motivates some people to want what they want and what environmental phenomena encourage them to do something or not do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start managing former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum are attempts to remain "part of the team."
This type of leader struggles with making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, delegating authority, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who thinks they need to change everything the team has done so far and do it their way.
The team leader is ultimately the one responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often leads to a gap between leaders and others.
Virtual teams should adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often represent the point of contact for the nearest physical group.
They are often more autonomous than traditional team members because their teams may meet in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" represents a leadership team to which each member is accountable. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization again? Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
After the efficient utilization of all available resources across all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity come to the fore.
As a result, the process of an organization seeking to overcome an obstacle through collaboration can lead to a new, innovative process for fulfilling a customer's need.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method by which organizations can achieve a higher degree of efficiency.
Neurobiological data represent physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby making the field of research narrower and much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior is confirmed by scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science-fiction connotation, it constitutes a very important branch of information science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, and the recognition of handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-world problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, construction, and the military because they are embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a significant part of every class. Often the teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel isn't an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual excursions. Students can view exhibits in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtually sharing the trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the site changes every year, but older versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve a student's writing skills. When students start blogging, they often make mistakes in grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually corrects this.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blog writer starts striving to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more resourceful in the world around them." The need to stimulate audience interest inspires them to be inventive and engaging (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and empowers students to transfer learning beyond the traditional school setting.
"The appropriate use of blogs can encourage students to think analytically and critically; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their position in the context of others' writings and express their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and offers a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Located somewhat further south are Niagara Falls, while the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond.
Because of all these things, foreigners experience Ontario as quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are citizens of Canada.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, along the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when it comes to flora and fauna.
Most smaller islands are independent states or have ties to France, and are known as luxury resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, which has taken deep root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that women traveling say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something that could be considered harassment, and it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Firmly reject men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (it's not okay regardless of cultural differences!).
Present-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and in the time of the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, the city was known as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Baida, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pots, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole array of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the nature of the fighting taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking options in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, we now use "Timbuktu" as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport, Timbuktu is today an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of sandstorms.
That was one of the main places Henry Louis Gates stopped at while filming the PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is the very opposite of other cities in the country because it has more Arab than African influence.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while its southern border is formed by the Crocodile River.
The park's area of 19,500 km² is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each inhabited by a different species of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading South African National Park (SANParks).
As in other South African national parks, daily conservation fees and entrance fees are payable.
Someone might also find it useful to buy a wildcard ticket that allows entry into specific parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is a major hub for many tourists.
The exhibition of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is comparable to a sparkling bar graph, made even more noticeable by the sea in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
British colonizers appropriated this place, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast, extending into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last vestiges of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Valley.
The Sundarbans spans an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by aquatic and wetland areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is estimated to now be home to 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Given that intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese buses of the Toyota Coaster brand are used; they are comfortable and robust.
Taxi sharing is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as the towns of Paro (Nu. 150) and Punakha (Nu. 200).
A suspension bridge stretches over the Oyapock River. The bridge over the Oyapock River connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 83 meters. It is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to open in September 2017, when the completion of Brazilian customs control points is expected.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous community inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco province was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering fruit, and fishing.
Following the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous population in the 16th century, Paraguay was formed, previously known as the "Great Province of the Indies".
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve its autochthonous character and identity.
The Argentinian national team and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held in other parts of the year.
For tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for matches, check the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are widely accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, but they may accept British and American currency; inquire with the owners in advance to find out about acceptable methods of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; temperatures of +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling that it is colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons: rainfall is generally consistent throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to human visits, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management instructions, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wildlife!
Regardless of how docile they may appear, bison, deer, reindeer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
An inglorious naval battle took place in the port in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships sank except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 German and American citizens lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the city.
Because Auckland has two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, it is safe to swim at them, and many offer shade from Pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches which can sometimes get crowded, with a long string of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines you should try, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might suit you better.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you're hesitant, you'll easily find bottled water.
The concept of a "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black coffee is an "espresso," a cappuccino has a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on par with Belgian chocolate. The fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of the aforementioned causes are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and adhere to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths north of the city from October to April. They sometimes appear in other months as well.
Sharks exist, but they often attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance takes a load off the traveler's mind because they know they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, organized transportation to/from the airport, or even flight and hotel combination packages.
I can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents necessary to reach your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agency, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants camp on the festival grounds, and most of them consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the stage as possible, you'll have to arrive early to get a spot.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stages ends, some parts of the festival will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas designed for families with young children.
If you are traveling the northern Baltic in winter, be careful when choosing a cabin because passing through the ice creates a terrible noise that is more audible in certain cabins.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers do not require a visa (check conditions).
Casinos usually try to maximize the amount of time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to maintain a good mood among guests and keep them at the establishment.
Some establishments offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication reduces judgment, and all good gamblers are aware of how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, there is little friction, and you can't drive as if you were on clear asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or wind-blown snow, condensation, or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many states, but traffic generally flows without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist draw in Africa and the best experience for many visitors.
In everyday usage, the term safari refers to a journey by land with the purpose of visiting amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannas.
Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to the car, and a good view is possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll have a better chance of seeing them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "safari on foot") consists of walking that lasts from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, host of the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for the 2020 Games before they were postponed, you might find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies were not extended to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels will rent you an iron and ironing board even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can also use a hair dryer if you have one handy.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods of water purification, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it's enough for the water to boil for one minute, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any doubts, buy bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not used to in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, transmit poison, or infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by applying force are not usually classified as plagues.
Shopping in duty-free stores offers the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can save a significant amount of money, especially when buying alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated forest terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be prepared for anything: steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections, typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the limits is more important than usual.
It's interesting, however, that the mobile service here is better than on many other sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite good and diverse in Bavaria, much like those of their southern neighbors, the Austrians.
Common desserts are pastries with fruit, for example, apples, which are added to desserts year-round, and cherries and plums, which are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. A cup of strong coffee often goes well with popular pastries.
If you crave small but satisfying bites, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
Yogurt is a common ingredient in curries in the interior of northern India and Pakistan; in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most often used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines across the country.
However, when used without further additions, the term refers to food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago, consisting of a range of simply seasoned dishes that are dominated by the flavors favored by the inhabitants of Java: peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer the rider greater stability, but also include certain safety risks because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, the horse could drag them if it bolts. Certain safety measures should be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most drivers wear boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if the rider pulls it backwards in a fall.
The Cochamó Valley is a major climbing destination in Chile, also known as the Yosemite of South America thanks to its diverse array of large granite cliffs and crags.
The views from the peaks are breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among the endless possibilities it offers.
Snow sports involving downhill runs, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow-covered slope using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity, and many people known as "ski enthusiasts" plan their annual vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational skiing club.
Backpacking and skiing: also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It's related to alpine skiing or hiking, although it doesn't usually include them. Hiking usually takes place on steep terrain and requires sturdier skis and boots.
Think of a ski slope as being similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than by walking, but you will very rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it consists of numerous independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean applying for visas multiple times and going through passport control.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this regard.
As long as you are in that zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, if you possess a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member country individually, which saves time, money, and reduces paperwork.
There is no universal definition of an antique. Some tax authorities define an antique as goods older than 100 years.
There are geographical differences in the definition, so the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products can be called antiques even if they were made later than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of income among the Sami people, and the culture associated with trading is also important for many people in other professions.
However, traditionally, not all members of the Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, and reindeer primarily served them for transportation.
Today, many Sámi people are engaged in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi area, Sápmi.
Although the word "Ciganin" is widely used, especially among non-Romance peoples, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about Roma people.

The views expressed are often brief, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
A storm is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world in various forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of hazardous weather conditions, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, showers and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include thunderstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the potential risk of inclement weather in their area, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
If you do an internet search with the keywords "hostile environment training," you will find the address of a local company.
The course generally covers all the issues discussed here in more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many lessons related to first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Many books and magazines deal with survival in the wilderness, but publications that cover war zones are rare.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must bring valid documents for their return.
The willingness to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or documents updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies from government to government.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect such documents also varies from government to government.
Screening at checkpoints also became more drastic in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery are unlikely to pass through a scanner without a violation of their privacy and dignity.
A rip current is a backwash of waves that break on the shore, often against a reef or the like.
Due to the subsurface topography, return flow is concentrated in a couple of deeper sections, and the formation of a rapid current towards greater depths is possible.
Death mostly occurs when a person becomes tired trying to swim against the current, which is often impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to swim in a way that you don't get caught in the current again or, depending on your skills and whether someone has spotted you, you can wait for help.
Reverse culture shock occurs before culture shock. The honeymoon phase is shorter, the shock lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their native one.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits that belong to your own.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers in a new country needed time to adjust.
People may not expect patience and understanding to be necessary when travelers return home.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show starts.
Usually, the sounds of tourists and merchants can be heard. The story of sound and light is like a fairytale.
The Sphinx is in the role of background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the highest concentration of bases – sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, which is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the island, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merge into a plateau, then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest Antarctic mountains, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote locations with no signal coverage, a satellite phone might be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you have to make calls outdoors and the satellite must be in your line of sight to make a call.
The service is often used in freight forwarding, on recreational vessels, but also on expeditions that require remote data and voice transmission.
Your telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
A increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is especially popular with school leavers as it allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education in your own country.
There is usually a tuition fee for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands on its lakes and in its coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to enjoy archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are big enough for yachting, smaller boats or kayaks offer a completely different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, which has one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most popular Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days and return to the ship at night to sleep.
If you are traveling inland as part of a shore excursion, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's no need to be ashamed of that: it's no different from the fears and aversions that many people feel towards certain other things.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for delivering shipments quickly. Time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but the problem arose with other routes and smaller companies.
If the cargo were sent by air, unloading and customs procedures on some routes would take days.
The only way to get through this faster is to send the items as checked baggage. According to airline rules, baggage cannot travel without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
It goes without saying that you'll be able to fly first or business class if you shell out a hefty wad of cash for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: generally speaking, expect it to cost you up to four times the regular price of an economy class seat, that is, eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that a certain group of passengers is willing to pay a large sum of money for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The language of the population is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has faced ethnic conflicts.
That conflict in 1994 led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the majority religion in Moldova.

Treat this place with the dignity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site with painted or carved graffiti on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because it is established by law as the primary official language.
Yes, Spanish also has wide application in public transport and other infrastructure.
Regular announcements in the metro are in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced via an automated system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being rude, arrogant egocentrics.
Although often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris is good behavior, that is, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will significantly ease your stay.
The brusque exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, with beech, spruce, and fir trees being the most common. The park is characterized by a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The park is home to a particularly wide range of plant communities due to the diverse microclimates, soil types, and variations in altitude within the park.
A remarkably diverse range of animals and birds live in that area.
Here, one can find rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with many other more common species.
When visiting the monastery, women must wear skirts that cover the knees as well as clothing that covers the shoulders.
Most monasteries have head coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
You can borrow them at the entrance, but the clothing isn't washed after every visitor, so you might not be comfortable wearing it. The sizes are one-size-fits-all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
Pa amb Oli is a favorite simple dish, especially eaten in the summer: it is bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available topping, such as cheese, tuna, and the like.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" which means "You" (formal), always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

It undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in the nominalized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters to pay particular attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, and carro means cart.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively simple and mostly regular.
This grammar primer will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish might easily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now mostly obsolete and used as museums or educational sites.
Mild pollution in their heyday was not the problem it is today. They are usually found in cities or on campuses and are more accessible than those built in the modern era.
The most advanced research telescopes are enormous structures located in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where the plum blossom was a favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility around the Imperial Palace.

Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many traditions characteristic of this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
According to custom, Easter night is spent in some open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian fertility rite in honor of the arrival of spring.
In more traditional churches, the Easter Vigil is often held on Saturday night during Easter weekend, with communities beginning the celebration of Christ's resurrection when the clock strikes midnight.
Most animals originally came to the islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not reach the island, so the giant tortoise became the main grazer in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not appear above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis because the sky will be more or less constantly dark.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is significantly more hierarchically oriented and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are worn in the workplace, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance - the emphasis is on collective effort, not glorifying the achievements of individuals.
Workers must often seek approval from their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
