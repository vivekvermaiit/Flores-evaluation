This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also reveals details that fossils could not provide—such as color and a three-dimensional image.
Scientists state that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft called a rachis but possess other feather features – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis likely evolved much later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for display. Researchers suggest that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult plumage, not downy fluff.
Researchers hypothesized that although it is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen exhibits adult plumage rather than downy fluff.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb detonated near the police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

They concluded that the Sun functions on the same basic principles as other stars: as it turned out, the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to changes in the magnetic field.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but a program was created to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for will be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way affect the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way it affects ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a nearly constant temperature, but it indicates that these must be deep pits in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Science Center at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting traditionally does not involve the use of high technology: voters enter the booth one at a time and place a pre-printed sheet of paper, on which their candidate is indicated, into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, they deposit the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
France's electoral law quite rigorously governs the process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting, and that no envelopes are added except those cast properly by duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, adhering to specific procedures.

In the second run of the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position in the women's сидячий (sitting) group with a total time of 4:41.30 – 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished in first place, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their runs, and 45 out of all 117 skiers did not place in the super-G slalom race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her stolen mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency workers were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any witness testimony could be challenged because her photo has been widely publicized.
In other UK provinces this is common practice, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are clearly heading down a dangerous path by disseminating photos and other data of suspected individuals."
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, told reporters that it would not provide any further comment, at least until charges are filed.
This document, according to the leak, will refer to the conflict surrounding the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered likely include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the maintenance of a military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA is willing to allow such a presence for only five years.
Hunters assisting in pest control had to be carefully monitored by rangers, as hunting was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with SSAA and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (SSAA), qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters' Association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial cull operation received proper safety briefings and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC).
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous CEC as part of a package of measures designed to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to large-scale protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes, violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been delayed since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 emergency situations related to these devices.
Last week, METP announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded, calling Apple's delay with the report "a major disappointment."
The earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Office reported that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued. Currently, at least six hostages are reported dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the elderly woman's place because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Ligginz followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and took a position at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that the introduction of the hormone accelerates the embryonic development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that state investigators recovered two flight recorders (black boxes) on Wednesday.
Fellow soldiers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a two-moon night. Pretty unique, just like she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as me...maybe even more so...love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34 percent of those surveyed share the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Looking at definitive answers to the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and participate in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, doubts have arisen about his physical condition.
He couldn't take painkillers because they are prohibited during participation in the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest currently known prime number.
Some people confirmed the discovery using various gadgets and software before the beginning of February, and this was reported on Tuesday.
Possibly, comets were a source of water delivery to Earth, as well as organic substances capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
Rumor has it that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration, will enable aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses satellite technology, as opposed to the more outdated ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with maximum accuracy and provide pilots with detailed information.
No additional transport will be running, surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the surface.
Fears over the lack of transportation have led to consideration of holding the game behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into a wide variety of forms. It can be hammered into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. An indicator can be created using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical is.
The acidity level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders by rotating them in a container, then knead them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, providing unusual sensations and forming something like a shell.
Toilets connected to a complex sewage system were present in almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a signal and then almost immediately reflects it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere somewhat distorts light and what we see.
A huge rocket, at least 100 feet tall, is needed to deliver a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to make transportation significantly easier and faster.
It gave us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Below are a larger number of mid-sized cats that prey on medium-sized game, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that hunt more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of niche – a special position that each cat occupies and that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult male relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely connected to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in many ways like packs of wolves or dogs – animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are just as dangerous to their prey.
A tiger, like a well-rounded athlete, can climb (although not very skillfully), swim, jump long distances, and also strike five times harder than a strong person.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
A tiger's growl isn't like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like confused shouts.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, if they can. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots stalk and track the animals they hunt by scent, searching for their scent on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they see very well in the dark and move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding in their surroundings and then suddenly pouncing on their victim.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to another island and thus cannot easily return), they can often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different rivals, so the new species will need to develop new traits or become a stronger competitor than it was before.
The Indigenous population hasn't changed at all – they still require the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, that is, the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an extremely important component of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we consume is plants.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the palate, meaning that no one who stood in his way would manage to escape.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly he was even a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that fell into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex wouldn't be able to compare to him.
Romans mostly ate food that is familiar to us as well, but they also had their own strange and unusual banquet treats, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to hold communal banquets where they reclined on their sides while eating.
The diet of ancient Romans could not have included foods brought to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a central temple, which was considered the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special towers in the shape of pyramids were built as parts of temples and were called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of this Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked food in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
In Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Old Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.

If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there is indeed something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document and is upside down.
Information about its author is unavailable, however it is known that at the beginning of its existence the document (which measures 29¾ by 24½ inches) was stored in a rolled-up state.
Therefore, it is quite likely that the entry was simply added as a label.
As a result of the D-Day landings and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
They were ruled by the French Vichy. These were Frenchmen who made a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, and this landing was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, Americans and the forces of the "Fighting France" movement liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture of a significant group of people who live and work together, that is, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," meaning "civil," which relates to the Latin word "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and this also, in a way, defines the size of the society.
City-states can be considered precursors to nations. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and uniform distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear, leaving no significant historical evidence, which leads to their not being recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—Congress was its sole component—according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and lacking a national executive or judiciary, it relied on state bodies, which often failed to cooperate in implementing all of its acts.
He also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent of all states before being amended, and the states took the central government so unseriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second-highest scoring team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Widely known types of sports competitions include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" due to the cluster/group of islands on which it is located.
Taiwan's origins lie as far back as the 15th century when European seafarers, sailing past, recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a branch in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) brought the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan under control, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photographic image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing; it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The often-used and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
According to it, the most effective place to position the main object is at the intersection of the lines that divide the raster into three thirds vertically and horizontally (see Example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion held European states together, despite differences in languages and customs.
His omnipresent power had an impact on everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should fight suffering and poverty, and the church's funds are intended precisely for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the central body of the church was located in Rome, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the church truly adhered to this tenet.
Shortly after the abrupt commencement of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective. Although the blockade violated generally accepted international legal norms codified by several international treaties of the last two centuries, it severed vital military and civilian supply routes.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire sections of the ocean, creating a danger even for neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing sentiments of most citizens and nations.
Having realized the horrors and brutality of war during the First World War, nations strived to prevent such a thing from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Nikola Tesla moved to the United States of America in order to apply for a position at Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were depicted in a unique way; each stage of the country's development represented a ruling family that became a prominent dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Jin and Han dynasties.
In those times, fierce wars took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in the history of Ancient China – thousands of people died in battles for the throne in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and also the belief that the state is the property of the people, not a single autocratic ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were open to all men who desired them, giving the most ambitious and talented the opportunity to succeed.
The same applied to the military, because instead of army ranks based on class, they were now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many members of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended this worldly life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira", on Mount "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved to this day, provides a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, she's not easy to find at all, even if you know she exists. Once inside the cave, you'll find yourself in complete isolation.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many large pyramids built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, are located several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Cheops), small tombs, temples, as well as the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" marking looks like the letter "V", while the "down-bow" marking resembles a bracket or a square without its bottom side.
Up bow means you start at the tip and push the bow, and down bow means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own markings in pencil, but be aware that printed markings for bowed string instruments have specific meanings, so they should usually be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women drove the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, out of Versailles and forced them to return to Paris.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of noisy people threatening the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At some point, a gang member waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The military expenditures of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses and interest on loans issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Super-profits from the prolonged exploitation of Filipinos would, of course, become the main achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one needs to understand the context that served as the impetus for the order's creation.
The era in which these events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is generally considered to be around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that actually encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the promotion of technology or the technological imperative to the idea that human destiny, in a strict sense, is dictated by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology as such follows a path that lies primarily outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on societies that are more inevitable than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might argue that a car necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is economically impractical for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in traffic accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new methods in the field of healthcare for treating bodily injuries.
Romanticism carried within it a significant element of cultural determinism, as seen in writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and a culture arose connected to that geography, and these, being in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known for being a center of luxury, originating around 400 AD and lasting until approximately 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its position worsened mainly because crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than in the markets of Byzantium.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the attire of the inhabitants of the east was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25-30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming in which the goal is to grow enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic system that uses harvested seeds from local plants of a given ecoregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this still persists in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards, allowing them to gain a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be defined by the age, ethnicity, social class, place of residence, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct phenomenon can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their belonging through the characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion items, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is to take several stories of unfortunate children who grew up in neglect, misery, or deliberate cruelty, and were not socialized by adults.
Such children are called "feral children" or wild children. They are often held in captivity by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents abandon their children to their fate due to the rejection of severe mental or physical disabilities of the latter.
It is possible that feral children were subjected to abuse or suffered serious trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some were allegedly raised by animals; some were said to have lived in the wild on their own.
An uncivilized child raised by animals behaves almost the same way (within the limits of physical capabilities) as the corresponding animal caregivers, for example, treating people with fear or indifference.
While project-based learning is meant to make learning simpler and more engaging, scaffolding goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather assistance provided to individuals learning new material, such as a new computer program, or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real; in other words, the teacher acts as scaffolding, just like the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds in software are designed to prompt, suggest, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to learn independently.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even violence.
No child should grow up in an environment devoid of care, attention, and nurturing, yet they do.
We feel that the foster care system should be a safe haven for these children.
Our system of foster care provides safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide everything the children lacked in the home they were previously removed from.
The internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as significant motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions – facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," pointed out that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately determine sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be present in animals, for example, domestic dogs.
A study conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genotypic variability: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alter the variation between two gene pools with each generation.
For primates with a digestive system like humans, it is difficult to satisfy their amino acid requirements from available plant resources in the savanna.
Moreover, failing to do so will have serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a significant amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all these things, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved the "protein question" in roughly the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a short interval (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other variations based on biorhythms involve drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is directly inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the available life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of achieving enlightenment. The only thing that can prevent us from reaching this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
Overall, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central place in Tibetan meditation is occupied by deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures led to these countries falling out with each other.
Two years had passed since the end of the war, and former allies had become enemies, leading to the start of the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and there were real battles between the armies of countries on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of eastern Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is definitely the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The task of naval forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time creating obstacles for your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain just as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that moved across hills and other pastures, and they were cared for by goat herders, often children or adolescents, more commonly known as shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
A cart road was built in England as early as the 16th century.
And although corduroy roads were essentially two parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses working on them to develop higher speeds and pull heavier loads than the slightly bumpier ordinary roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced to hold the rails in place quite early on. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more effective if an iron fastening was installed on top of them.
This became a common practice, even though the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails appeared.
The first known form of movement was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecines, did not walk upright as a matter of course.
Bipedalism is found in the fossil remains of australopithecines dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have begun walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to at least somehow reduce future suffering.
In many cases, this is just treating the symptoms. However, if we're not aiming for just a temporary solution, then it's worth finding the root of the problems and eliminating them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150-200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was dispatched to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
Currently, it is known that 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript copy is lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives on to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
Their paws have scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
In fact, all computers in use today operate by processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
In the binary number system, there can be only one or two values, for example 0 or 1, and, in computer jargon, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not manifest immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are too general to immediately make a diagnosis.
The first sign of poisoning may be the presence of an open jar of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
From a formal perspective, entomologists describe this group of insects with the term beetle.
This term reflects centuries of familiarity with bed bugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both conenose bugs and bed bugs are nest parasites adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged and younger people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women have twice the risk of developing MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or not in the best interests of their child.
These parents may decide to create an adoption plan for their child.
In cases of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to learn how the world works using scientific methods. This method truly guides most scientific research.
While it's not just about experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were acknowledged.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often strongly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic factors, are found in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle with a free-running period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey–Chase experiment became one of the foundational proofs in the question of whether DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
Another example is visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo, as well as gaining new information about them.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns in their cars to get to their jobs, while others drive past them, heading to work in the places they just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth of traffic, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Now, science notes that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported the evolution of humankind for the last two million years.
Everyone lives in a society and uses transportation systems. At the same time, almost everyone complains about them.
You don't often hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems evoke so much criticism and suffer failures daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental at play?
Traffic flow is defined as the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave quite consistently; thus, traffic flows mostly have some logical sequence and can have an approximate mathematical model.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These ratios are helpful in the planning, design, and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings along their body.
This opens up a wider range of small places for them to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the entire Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed in his correctness, but many people believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems rational, since we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching a width of 6 miles.
A full 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main channel of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in either size or the technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the structures of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a language of everyday communication for most of those who work in the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of them can be found in nature in native form, and extracting them with primitive tools is quite simple.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also hypothesized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that include non-metallic elements, such as carbon in small quantities.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of these particles could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, after its appearance, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods emerged, the status and use of the pencil were diminished.
People now write messages on a computer screen, having no need to go near a pencil sharpener.
We can only guess what the keyboard will become when something newer is invented.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Nuclear fission releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The Moon's upper layer is called the crust.
The Moon's crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
He is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
The near side may have more lunar maria because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been acquired by them in the process of growing up.
These theories encompass specific people and what drives them to want the things they do, and what things in their environment either compel or discourage them from doing certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can arise when managers start managing their former colleagues. On the one hand, they try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has problems with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable personality who feels compelled to change everything the team has done and do it their own way.
Ultimately, the leader bears full responsibility for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtually formed teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but some differences exist.
Members of virtual teams often act as points of contact with their immediate real-world group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet with time zones in mind, which may not be clear to their local managers.
The presence of a genuine "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "Invisible Team" is a management group to which all members report. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of implementing a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice could be innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization's collaborative work to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of a new, innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
"Angel" (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities. In this way, they narrow the search area and make it more precise.
Researchers are supported in their studies by the correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our consciousness.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important subfield of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
In AI research, machines are being made to automate tasks that require intellectual behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and design, the ability to respond to customer feedback and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become distinct disciplines focused on solving real-world problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the armed forces, as they have been integrated into several applications related to home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important thing in any class. Often, the teacher would like to visit places with the students that are impossible to reach by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts or marvel at beautiful art while sitting with their class.
A virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website each year about their trip to the state capital; the website is reworked every year, but its old versions are saved online as an archive.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing skills. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers are starting to try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "encourages students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest motivates students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn effectively beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can inspire students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' articles, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa, the beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada, has a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's history and contemporary life.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while to the north stretches the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and the regions beyond.
All these things, and others, highlight what outsiders consider to be quintessentially Canadian about Ontario.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that might surprise many: the United States has more African Americans than Canada has citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest, and is a continent in its own right, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it took strong root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
To the north, this region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It would also be advisable to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what you might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Firmly refuse men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, this is not normal!).
The current city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese completely destroyed it and then rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but they abandoned it in 1755 after the earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Dar al-Baida, and the Spanish traders, who established trading posts here, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Not far from the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo on the extreme east, bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, before traveling outside of it, it is necessary to study the situation with the fighting that is still ongoing in the North Kivu province.
This city also serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for one of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking experiences in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). The typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Because of this, and also due to its relative inaccessibility, the name "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although it has an airport and attracts tourists with its history.
In 1990, it was included on the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the key stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS report "Wonders of the African World."
The city sharply contrasts with other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different representatives of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, visitors are charged a daily conservation and entrance fee.
It might also be beneficial for someone to buy a Wild Card, which grants access to some parks in South Africa or all National Parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is a place of particular interest to many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's architectural face has been compared to a dazzling histogram, made all the more prominent by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon side, opposite the harbor.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely situated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place appropriated by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coastlines of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, as they include some of the last islands of mighty jungle that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans occupy an area of 3,850 km², with about a third of that covered by water or marshland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that it is currently home to 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days before traveling.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and durable.
A minibus taxi is a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150) and Punakha (200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the banks of the Oyapock River and the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The pylons are 83 meters high, and the bridge is 378 meters long. It has two lanes for vehicle traffic, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully opened in September 2017, once the Brazilian customs posts are completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who occasionally practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, as a result of clashes between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous peoples, Paraguay was created, which was previously called the "Giant Province of the Indians."
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a significant portion of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Canitas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year as well.
Contact the Argentine Polo Association for news regarding tournaments and ticket sales for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP) at a one-to-one ratio.
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the "FIC West" store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and many establishments also accept Stanley credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although they may take British or United States currency; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't any distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains fairly constant throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are used to people, wild animals are still wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management instructions, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so bring and cook only odorless food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor became the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave it.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Thanks to Auckland's location between two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Virtually all of them are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pōhutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly, sometimes crowded beaches with many small shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer, "Number One," is simple but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
You can taste many French wines, but New Zealand or Australian wines may withstand transportation better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, however, if you are concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of "flat white" coffee is unfamiliar to Australians. Short black is "espresso," cappuccino is made with a dollop of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate meets the requirements of Belgian standards. And the fruit juices are not cheap at all, but they are wonderful.
Many reef trips occur year-round, and injuries caused by any of these reef-related reasons are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay particular attention to danger warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they can be seen in other months as well.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not spend much time in the ocean; their primary natural habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind and the assurance that they will have a place to stay as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often partner with specific hotels, although you can try to book other accommodation with them, such as a campsite.
Travel agents usually offer service packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages of flights and hotels.
They can also hold a booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your trip (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should still go through the travel agency first, and not directly through the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a significant majority of music event attendees decide to stay overnight on-site, and for most attendees, this is an important part of the adventure.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to come early to get a spot closer to the stage.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages has stopped, there might be sections at the festival that will play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the cabin's location, because traveling through ice causes a rather horrible sound if you're very close to its source.
St. Petersburg cruises involve spending time in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos typically put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and indoors.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication negatively affects the ability to assess a situation, so all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get stuck in it.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by the formation of water or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without disruption throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, drawing the attention of many visitors.
The term "safari" in general usage refers to a journey overland to admire the incredible African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closely, so standard equipment will allow you to get a good look at them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be timid, and are best observed through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari," or "walking" trip) is a hike lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the tournaments will be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but by the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation waivers had not been extended to July 2020 – the time the Olympic Games were scheduled for.
Most tickets for the performances are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. In many hotels, an iron and ironing board can be rented, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which could cause shrinkage or, in the worst case, a burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, you need to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies. If you're having problems, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they haven't heard of in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on goods like alcohol and tobacco.
The most challenging section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, as it often passes through isolated, forested wilderness.
If you are unfamiliar with rural roads, please note: they are characterized by steep slopes, narrow paths, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and it is extremely important to adhere to them.
Interestingly, however, the mobile connection here is much better than on many other stretches of the route, for example, in the "Pennsylvania Wilds."
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and diverse, similar to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are quite common: apples are used in baking year-round, while cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often especially delicious with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small, but delicious pastry, try what is called "Berliner," "Pfannkuchen," or "Krapfen" depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally added to curry; in Southern India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is traditionally added.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, if used without further clarification, this term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now very common throughout the archipelago and offers a wide variety of simply seasoned dishes, among which the predominant flavors are peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of fragrant spices.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability but can be dangerous due to the potential for the rider's foot to get caught in them.
If a horse throws its rider and the rider's foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may run and drag them. Several safety precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety features that allow the stirrup and its leather to detach from the saddle if a falling rider is dragged by it.
The Cochamo Valley, with its diverse array of granite high rises and cliffs, is a premier rock climbing destination in Chile, also known as the Yosemite of South America.
Climbing includes admiring breathtaking views from the summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes among the endless potential of the walls.
Alpine skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope on skis or a snowboard that are attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities, enjoyed by many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skis is very old - cave paintings dating back to 5000 BC depict skiers!
Alpine skiing as a sport originated no later than the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called ski touring, ski mountaineering, or ski hiking.
This is related, but usually does not include alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which are conducted on steep slopes and require the use of stiffer skis and boots.
Consider the ski trail to be similar to a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to travel greater distances than on foot – but you will rarely be able to reach the speed of cross-country skis without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with a large number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean going through the visa process and passport control multiple times.
However, the Schengen area in this sense operates as if it were one country.
By staying in this zone, you can typically cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to obtain visas separately for each of the countries that are part of the Schengen area, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies classify goods over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition varies depending on the geographical location – the age restriction in North America, for example, may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be considered antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for many who have other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami were engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting, and the like, usually keeping reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern commerce. Tourism in Sápmi, where the Sami live, generates significant income.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about these people.
If a country you are planning to visit becomes the subject of government travel advisories, this may affect your travel health insurance and trip cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult with the governments of countries other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face situations different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Newsletters provide only brief information about the political situation in the country.
The presented data is often superficial, generalized, and highly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they come in various types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are types and consequences of bad weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to inquire about the risks of adverse weather conditions in their area, as these may impact their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a zone of military operations should undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for the "Hostile Environment" course will likely yield the address of a local company.
As a rule, all the issues discussed here are covered in much more detail in the course, usually with practical exercises.
Typically, the course lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid training, and sometimes firearms training.
Books and magazines about surviving in the desert are common, but publications about combat zones are few.
Tourists planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender markers (X) or documents updated to reflect a preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to take such documents into account also varies greatly.
Searches at border checkpoints also became more stringent in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are return flows from waves breaking on the shore, often at a reef or similar feature.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper areas, and a rapid current can form there flowing into deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back will be no more difficult than usual.
Try to head to where you won't be caught in the current again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it might be better to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock hits earlier than culture shock (shorter than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Those travelers who had no problems adapting to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are already adapted to a new culture and have lost certain habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, because they knew that travelers needed to adapt in a new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are just as necessary for travelers when returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most fascinating activities for children in this area.
You will be able to see the pyramids in the dark, and you will be able to see them in the silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and merchants. The history of sound and light is like a collection of short stories.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator to a long history.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by several countries, have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano lies at the base of a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a territory in the south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula converge into a plateau, then rise again, forming the 360-kilometer Ellsworth Mountains range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains of Antarctica: the Vinson Massif and Vinson Peak, reaching a height of 4892 m.
In remote areas with no cell service, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a call.
This service is often used on vessels, including cruise ships and expeditions, that require remote data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider should provide more information about connecting to this service.
Traveling and studying are becoming an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This practice is particularly popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, studying abroad during a gap year can indeed improve your chances of getting into a university in your home country.
Usually, such educational programs are paid.
Finland is a wonderful place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also encompasses thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, considering that there is one boat for every seven to eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but overall it's a rather unique phenomenon (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty).
Most of these notable Baltic Sea cruises feature extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend several full days at a historical site, returning to the ship at night.
When you only go ashore on ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (valid as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have experienced traumatic events.
This is nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears or disgust towards other things that many people have.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome fear rooted in ignorance or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of items. Most often, time is of the essence when it comes to delivering business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On certain routes, larger companies have their own planes, but in the case of other routes and smaller firms, they encountered a problem.
If they shipped things by air, unloading and customs clearance would take only a few days on some routes.
The only way to do it quickly was to send it as registered baggage. Aviation regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
To fly in first or business class, obviously, you have to shell out a thick wad of cash for this privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay 4 times the standard economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Generally, on direct flights from point A to point B, there's no point in looking for discounts on business class or first class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay the maximum amount for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, situated around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled houses, an 18th-century bazaar, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the neighboring island of Eysturoy, and it also has an unusual octagonal church.
Interesting marble sculptures of doves are installed above some of the tombs in the churchyard.
It's worth taking at least a half-hour walk through this intriguing village.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and captivating town of Sintra, which became widely known to foreigners after Lord Byron's rapturous account of its splendor.
The Scotturb 403 bus provides regular transport to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Brothers of the Temple), a place of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a place of extraordinary significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived imprisonment here, and even more whose loved ones were killed here or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or graffiting the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known as self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Overall, it's nothing more than a false stereotype, but the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will greatly simplify your trip.
The Parisian's severity will quickly disappear if you show a little common respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily overgrown with forest, mainly beech, pine, and spruce, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts an exceptional diversity of plant life due to its varied microclimates and soil types, as well as changing altitudes.
This area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Here you can find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, as well as many other known species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who come unprepared, but if you come with your own, especially in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow them from the storage near the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may find it unpleasant to wear them. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa Amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word "Sie" meaning "you," are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
Perhaps it also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or an adjective in a substantivized form is being used.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced the same way they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowels.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means expensive, while carro means chariot.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people with a slight knowledge of Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is quite similar and doesn't need to be studied separately.
Today, old observatories are generally outdated and operate as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem during their heyday as it is today, they tend to be located in cities or on campuses and are easier to reach than those built in the modern era.
Most modern telescopes for scientific research are huge objects in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the Emperor in the Imperial Palace only for himself and other members of the aristocracy.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to destroy even "just one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formally maintained garden, collecting "samples" will also result in expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally an exceptionally safe and very easy place to navigate, where you can buy practically anything you need upon arrival.
However, being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both the heat (always) and the scorching sun (when the sky is clear, which is less often).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you plan to board goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great idea for a vacation.
Say, visit the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or go on a cruise to interesting places on the Danube River, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also map out routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter services on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and believers frequently begin the celebration at the stroke of midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on the islands got here either by water or by air.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
After humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals appeared there, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will discover the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that which people in Western countries are accustomed to.
The standard business attire is suits. Employees address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the work environment is given a prominent place, with the efforts of the group being valued above all else, rather than personal achievements.
Employees often need to obtain approval from their supervisor for any decisions, and they are expected to unquestioningly follow the supervisor's instructions.
