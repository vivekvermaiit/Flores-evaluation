This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely accepted theory, but also offers details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top with a light-colored or carotenoid background.
The discovery also offers insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed quill, called a rachis, but do possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers deduce that the rachis was likely a more recent evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers have suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
Researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, and not down.

Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done has been primarily theoretical, but the program has been written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.

They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day, and warmer during the night.
"Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the hypothesis that they are deep pits in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a not very technological experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting sheet.
French electoral law strictly codifies procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added other than those of voters duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strong supervision, following specific procedures.

The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position in the women's sitting group, with a combined time for all runs of 4:41.30; 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first to finish, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's sit-ski group did not finish their races, and 45 of the total 117 giant slalom skiers failed to qualify in the race.
The laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen were recovered thanks to the work of the Madhya Pradesh police.
Acting Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
Despite that, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Sheriff Court in Scotland charged with the murder of her son.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be rejected because his image has been published everywhere.
This is common practice anywhere else in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have viewed the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service has told reporters that it will not be making any further statements, at least until the verdict.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish according to the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Among the other issues discussed, according to reports, were the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA only commits to accepting it for five years.
The hunters in the supplemental pest control pilot program had to be closely supervised by forest rangers, while the pilot program was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's Association Hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received adequate safety training and instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of elections being held, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod malfunction and overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported a further 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
In response, the ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as "frankly unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office has said that no damage has been reported in the nation.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there had been no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage for hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and so far, at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, have recently been released.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Pretty unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as freaky as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and I'll find her at the altar...I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question due to his complaints.
He hasn't been able to take the necessary medication to cope with his pain because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered as of January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivered to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term in office earlier this year and last month signed a law to legalize same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
It is speculated that he/she will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike the old ground-based radar technology, because air traffic controllers can locate pilots much more precisely and send them more accurate information.
There are no plans to increase public transport, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley; at street level, there are also no car parks or park-and-ride facilities.
The concern about a lack of transportation has led to consideration of the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new species of bird in the equatorial Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, despite it being thought that this process required much more time, due to interbreeding between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis (endemic), and a large cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris (foreign).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into the tiniest of figures.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be twisted together. It can be hammered or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very thin and layered on top of other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Red cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the substance being analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (in that hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean, damp hands, form them into a ball.
The moisture from the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women gathered together.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our view.
A giant rocket taller than 100 feet is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most notable thing the wheel has done for us has been to make transportation much faster and easier.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport brought us here.
Below them are mid-sized cats that eat mid-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including feral domestic cats) that eat the small prey that are far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat has that prevents them from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
Herds are formed by one to three related adult males along with up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave largely like packs of wild dogs or wolf packs, which are animals with surprisingly similar behaviour to lions (though not to that of other big cats) and are equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances, and push with 5 times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's full-throated roar, but rather similar to a shouted phrase of angry words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find the animals they eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing the trails they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main and original group (for example, by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by migrating to a new island and being unable to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, that we expire).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat are plants. Without plants, most animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, which is why it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws held over seventy teeth, sharp as knives, accompanied by an additional set on the roof of its mouth, so there was no escape for anything that stood in its way.
We don't know for absolutely certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, long fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could compete with it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some rare or unusual products at their banquets, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and rodents called dormice.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate sitting on a chair, rich men liked to participate in banquets where they squatted huddled together while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
Thus, for example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's house.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary that only priests could access.
Sometimes, special pyramids in the form of towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The summit of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
Most of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling west, discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
However, despite its discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living there at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that behind the Declaration of Independence there's a treasure map written.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its creation the long parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it seems the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by "Vichy" France. These were French people who had signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and who collaborated with the invaders instead of confronting them.
The Allies invaded the south of France on August 15, 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, related to the Latin "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," with the meaning of city or city-state, and this also defines in some way the dimensions of society.
City-states preceded nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving obvious historical traces and are not recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it fell to the state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
The most well-known sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 auto racing.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and they feature the presence of Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the 7th largest island nation in the world.
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it, in geographic terms, an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by gave the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, where it began the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese workers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) take control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and declare Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the close of the era of analog films.
It still occurs today, but even more importantly: its aspect ratio has been inherited in the sensor formats of digital imaging cameras.
The 35mm format actually creates a bit of confusion, with 36mm width and 24mm height.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is said that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for this reason.
The main authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this dogma was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, cutting off vital supplies to both military personnel and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire ocean segments, endangering even neutral vessels.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his last job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different historical eras: each stage of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Likewise, after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve them.
This also applies to the military, because instead of basing the ranks of the army on class, from this point on they were based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that transcend this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that would be known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a fairly clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is located completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even knowing it exists, it's not at all easy to find. The isolation is absolute once you get inside the cave.
Nothing can be seen except for a clear and beautiful sky above, and the abundant mountains that surround it. Very little of this world can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "arc upwards" symbol looks like the letter V (lowercase v), and the "arc downwards" symbol looks like a staple or a square without its bottom side.
When it appears upwards it means you have to start at the tip and push the bow in an upward direction, and when it's downwards it means you have to start at the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow in a downward direction.
Strumming the strings from right to left generates a softer sound, while doing it the other way around produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
Feel free to add your own markings, but keep in mind that the bow markings are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and babbled threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows fully open.
At one point, a member of the crowd displayed the head of a murdered royal guard from Versailles before the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, in order to cover a good part of the expenses and interest on the bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the huge profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that promoted the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is popularly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a broad range of ideas, from technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by a hidden logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for a handful of cars isn't economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new medical assistance techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a significant component of cultural determinism, drawn upon by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged that were better than laws imposed arbitrarily, since they were in harmony with the place and with society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Their status diminished during the twelfth century, especially because the crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices that had more value than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this moment that the title of fashion capital went from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak popularity in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles could reach the West with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the era is that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to button their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is that which is carried out to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses saved native seeds from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differentiate themselves due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture are often distinguished from those of other subcultures by their distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to turn to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some feral children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical deficiency.
Feral children may have suffered child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others have supposedly been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all alone.
The feral child, when raised only by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (always within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference in relation to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding theory is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals undergoing a new training experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real: in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little helper clip from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and are designed to question, show, and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to manage on their own.
Children are taken into care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not fed, loved, and educated, but some do.
We believe that the family foster care system is a form of security for these children.
Our reception system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster care is supposed to provide for all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were originally taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that these human behavior interpretation abilities could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the total pool of variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine forward and backward variation between the two genetic heritages in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy their amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Moreover, failing to achieve it has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain would have been the proteins provided by leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, these are difficult for primates like us humans to digest.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a while (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do using a quiet alarm clock that makes you aware but doesn't fully wake you up.
If you're the type to snooze your alarm in your sleep, try putting it on the other side of the room, so you have to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find peace and complete satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but spread through the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Kundalini Yoga awakens the kundalini energy (enlightened energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes, and cultures, and the two countries became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It stretched on for the next forty years and was fought in earnest, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Peace of Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, or multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is, by far, the most efficient method of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most relevant recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
Contemporaneously, the German navy, primarily using submarines, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to conquer Great Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pasture areas, often watched over by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
The carriages were built in England as far back as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they used horses to pull the wagons to achieve higher speeds and haul larger loads in the more difficult sections.
Cross ties were introduced quite early on to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon seen that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron covering on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons more.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first rails made entirely of iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in australopithecine fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although sahelanthropus may have walked on 2 legs as far back as 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering that could exist in the future.
This works only as a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and that problems have grown due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thompson, was sent to John Dunlap's print shop located a few streets away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known today as "Dunlap flyers."
The first public reading of the document was carried out by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is, in fact, still alive. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many features of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus would.
Practically all the computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Look for first aid instructions specific to the specific poison on the label.
The term insect is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term derives from its ancient kinship with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both reduviids and bedbugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has concluded that women are twice (2 times more) as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only thing, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
Just as the knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living beings, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the virus's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the virus's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of in-situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small rural villages to go to their workplace, passing by others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic vehicle, everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows us today that this enormous coal-based economy has dislodged one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of humankind for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate these kinds of complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions that are established between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a considerably consistent range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have considerable constancy and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their body.
This provides them with a wide variety of tiny places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
There were people who thought what he was saying was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved towards the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because we don't exactly have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It more closely resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although, according to his theory, they also changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. It is clear that there are also other metals like silver and gold.
One can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The entire Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and fewer uses.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, never needing a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer emerges.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Separating the nucleus again releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust measures 70 km thick in the nearest part and 100 km in the farthest part.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the mountainous regions.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people like or are interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they want, and what things in their environment will cause them to do, or not do, certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can appear when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to continue as "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable for their actions.
In the opposite case, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in squabbles between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
Members of a virtual group often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that local management may not understand.
The presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administrative team that each member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, the joint work of an organization to overcome adversity can lead to an innovative process to respond to the client's needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the area of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has been known for a long time that different types of damage, traumas, injuries, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it is a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been built into various domestic computer applications and video games.
Themed outings are an important part of any class. Very often, a teacher would love to take their students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual tour is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital; each year the site is updated, but the old versions remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the existence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger is starting to make an effort to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogs "force students to be more astute about the world around them." The need to fuel audience interest inspires students to be clever and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students to be more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of what others write and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics by actively responding to internet materials (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of outsiders as the quintessential Canadian city.
The population of the vast northern expanses is rather sparse, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make a population comparison that is often surprising: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it embarked on a great journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and don't be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazigh fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and Phoenicians, Romans, and Banu Marin used it as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, towards the easternmost end, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it would be wise to investigate before making any visits outside the city to assess the state of the fighting that persists in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special program "African Wonders of the World" for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, the Zimbabwe border to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark for South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entrance fee must be paid.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a selection of South African parks or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main center.
The collection of buildings that make up the urban skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a gleaming bar graph, made all the more striking by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the other side of the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers occupied, therefore it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, but include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that the area now holds 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
As buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Although construction was completed in August 2011, it wasn't possible to use it until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs are also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies," was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important annual tournament for this sport takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Here, you can also see smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), with a fixed value equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outlying islands, although they may accept British and American currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which method of payment is accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so you should do it before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below-freezing levels, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is more or less invariable throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
However docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't left enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking odorous foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous insubordination in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruise ship. In addition, almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are plentiful, as Auckland straddles two harbours. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most well-known local beer is "Number One"; it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines there, but New Zealand and Australian wines don't quite tolerate travel well.
It is completely safe to drink the local tap water, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of a "tallat" (cortado) is foreign. A "cafè curt" (short coffee) is an espresso, a cappuccino comes loaded with cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
Despite this, follow the recommendations of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of these months as well.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and stay away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean; their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel deals.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to submit other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any request or suggestion should be sent to the travel agency first and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp right there, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to get there very early to secure a camping spot near the music.
It should be remembered that even though the music on the main stages has finished, there may be sections of the festival that continue playing well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of your cabin, because traversing the ice generates a terrible noise in the most affected ones.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos tend to strive to maximize the time and money that their visitors leave there. There tend to be no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They often have special foods, drinks, and entertainment offers to encourage guests and prevent them from leaving the establishment.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages inside the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know that it's important to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or in mountainous areas should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
Friction is low on icy and snowy roads, and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to leave you stranded in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling or wind-blown snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without much disruption throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most important for many tourists.
The term safari, in popular usage, refers to a journey overland to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment will allow for good views.
Animals such as lions, cheetahs and leopards are shy from time to time, and that is why you may see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you made the flight and accommodation booking for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to be held.
It is expected that most tickets to the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical ticket costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels can provide an iron and ironing board upon request, even if there isn't one in the room.
If there isn't an iron available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain dangers.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is enough; in others, a few minutes are needed.
Effectiveness varies from filter to filter, and in case of concerns, you should consider buying water from a known brand in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of injuring or killing people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers tied to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated wooded terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow sections, and sharp curves are predominant.
The speed limits indicated are noticeably lower than those of other sections before and after - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to the limits is even more important than would otherwise be the case.
Although it's curious, the mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other segments of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and Bavarian pastry is plentiful and very diverse, similar to that of Austria, their southern neighbors.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked into the pastries year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most well-known cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small pastries, but full of flavor, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term to cover a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without any other qualifier, the term usually refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is easy to find throughout the archipelago and offers a wide variety of simply seasoned dishes. The Javanese often prefer the flavors of peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from each side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the rider, but they can present safety problems because the rider's feet could get trapped in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. Several safety precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
To begin, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a fairly thin and fine sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the mount if a rider pulls it backward when falling.
The Cochamó Valley: Chile's premier climbing destination, also known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
There are impressive views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among its endless expanse of walls.
Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacations around skiing in a particular place.
The concept of skiing is very old – there are cave paintings depicting skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, but it was in 1861 when some Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called ski touring, ski mountaineering, or ski hiking.
It is related to them, but generally does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter executed on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover distances a bit longer than walking - although you'll rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between several countries would involve having to make many visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, even so, functions as a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, holding a Schengen visa means you don't need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition for manufactured items that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies determine that goods over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America compared to Europe.
Handcrafted products can be categorized as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of livelihood among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the herding is also important for many with other professions.
Even in tradition, however, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived from fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami territory.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "gitano" is generally considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to any traffic alert, your travel or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might be interested in hearing the recommendations of governments different from your own, but their recommendations are designed for their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East might be exposed to different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The briefings are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The considerations presented are usually brief, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather condition is the general term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruptions, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur worldwide, and there are different kinds that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of adverse weather phenomena, such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the severe regional and seasonal atmospheric phenomena are blizzards, snowstorms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of adverse weather that may affect their area, as it could disrupt their travel plans.
Anyone intending to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should take a professional training course.
An internet search for "Hostile environment course" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A typical course will cover all the issues discussed here in greater detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, plenty of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that discuss survival in nature are common, but publications that deal with war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery in another country should ensure they bring valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify sex (X) or updated documents to display the desired name or sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents may vary widely.
Security checkpoint screenings have also become far more invasive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transsexuals should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow that returns after waves crash onto the beach, often at a reef or similar.
Due to the topology of the water, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper stations, and a strong current towards deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you're out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head to a place where you won't be captured again, or, depending on your abilities or if you've been informed, you might want to wait for a rescue.
Reverse culture shock arrives before cultural adjustment (with a minor honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture often find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after having lived abroad, you've already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you went abroad, at first people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Sometimes one doesn't foresee that patience and understanding are also necessary when travelers return home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
Generally, the sounds of tourists and vendors are heard. The story of sound and light is truly a tale.
The Sphinx establishes itself as a backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes of the story are shown on the pyramids, which are illuminated at the same time.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are disputed among many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, there are Livingston and Deception Islands, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge and form a plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a maximum of 4,892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no phone service, satellite phones may be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to make a phone call.
The service is typically used on vessels, including recreational craft, as well as in expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
A growing popular option among people considering a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among students who haven't finished their studies, giving them the opportunity to take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
Enrolling in a gap year course abroad can often improve your chances of restarting higher education in your home country.
Typically, there will be registration fees for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a significant sailing destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although any yacht can pass through the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it's still quite special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it's possible to visit the city's historical center by spending a couple of full days there, returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only disembark for on-board excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or if they have suffered a traumatic experience.
It's not a cause for shame: there's no difference between it and the personal fears and apprehensions that many people express towards other things.
For some, having knowledge about how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Delivery companies charge well for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandise, or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent the items by plane, there are routes where unloading and customs clearance can take days.
The only way to send it faster was to do it as checked baggage. The airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger to carry it, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: you can generally expect to pay up to four times the price of an economy ticket for business class, and up to eleven times for first class!
Generally, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there's a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay more for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is commonly used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, although it is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city exudes an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than of traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy. There is also a very unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are some interesting sculptures of doves made of marble on some of the tombs.
It's worth taking a stroll through the interesting town for half an hour to an hour and a half.
To the north and easily accessible lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous to foreigners after a brilliant account of its splendours was recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb bus 403 goes to Sintra regularly, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the grand Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima, a place of Marian apparitions known throughout the world.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and a place of almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the site by painting or etching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Close to half prefer to speak in Catalan, a large majority understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because it is, by law, the priority official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced with an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just a vague stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to be on your best behavior, act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make it much easier for you to get around.
The brusque demeanor of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show a minimum of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded, with beeches, spruces, and firs, and is home to a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It enjoys a remarkable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soils, and diverse altitudes.
The area is also home to a vast variety of animal and bird species.
You can find peculiar fauna there, such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie, along with many more common species.
During visits to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and must also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer shawls to women who don't come prepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must also wear trousers that cover their knees.
This item can also be ordered at the entrance, but this is clothing that isn't washed after every use, so you might find it uncomfortable to wear these skirts. One size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available condiment such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie" for "you" (formal), always begin with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is a good way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can be said that it facilitates reading, although the writing is a bit complicated because it's necessary to figure out if a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowels that follow them.
Also, make sure you pronounce the 'r' and 'rr' differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means cart.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading these basic concepts about grammar will greatly help you to learn Persian grammar and understand its sentences better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know how to speak some Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese resembles it so much that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today and remain as museums or places of education.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, making them easier to access than those built today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, an activity known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where the cherry blossom was the most prized.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden and pick any "sample," you'll also be kicked out unceremoniously.
Generally, Singapore is an extremely safe and very easy place to navigate, and you can buy practically anything after you arrive.
But by being located in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to face both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme on which to base a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to the interesting cities of the Danube, or sailing through the Erie Canal.
They also establish routes for well-known hiking and cycling circuits.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Also, non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world have adopted many of the traditions surrounding the holiday.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night keeping vigil somewhere outdoors to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very plausible that it is a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The most traditional churches often celebrate an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, and congregations typically begin the celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The great distance from the continent prevented mammals from traveling there, which led to the giant tortoise becoming the first grazing animal in the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced there, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will remain dark practically all day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to seeing.
Suits are the standard attire for business, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Peace in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort more than celebrating individual achievements.
Workers often need the approval of their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without questioning them.
