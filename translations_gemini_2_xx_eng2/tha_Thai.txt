Although one experimental vaccine can reduce the death rate from Ebola, no drug has yet been clearly shown to be suitable for treating existing infections.
Initially, the ZMapp antibody cocktail seemed like it would be a good option in this area, however formal research studies indicate that it's less effective at preventing death than desired.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning scientists used it as the standard and a comparison against the other 3 treatments.

This not only confirms the widespread theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides additional details that typical fossils cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal is chestnut-brown on top and pale or carotene-colored underneath.
The discovery also provides an in-depth look at the evolution of feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed central shaft called a rachis but possessed other feather characteristics such as barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved after these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or simply for aesthetics. Researchers point out that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows that it is adult plumage, not downy fluff.

Candidates may send representatives to participate as witnesses in every step. In the evening, volunteers will count the ballots under strict supervision and according to a specific process.

Her first event was the slalom, where she didn't reach the finish line on her first run; 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her other event, the Giant Slalom, she finished 10th in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes behind first-place Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished 9th.
Four female sit-ski athletes failed to finish, and 45 out of 117 athletes in the Giant Slalom event failed to be ranked.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The suspects are Baba Khanjar, Buddha Khanjar, Rampro Khanjar, Gaza Khanjar, and Vishnu Khanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the suspect appeared in court with their face concealed.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
Nevertheless, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road is temporarily closed due to a car accident where emergency services are extracting the driver from a red Audi TT.
Initially, he received treatment at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in custody at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his own son ever since.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but the eyewitness testimony may be weak due to widespread publicity of her image.
Elsewhere in the UK, this is common practice, but the Scottish justice system does not work this way, and the courts view the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee stated, "It appears that journalists are walking a dangerous line if they release all images of suspects to the public."
The public prosecutor's office, which is responsible for overall prosecution, has made it clear to reporters that it will not be making any further comments until at least some progress has been made in the case.
According to leaked news, this document will refer to the border dispute claimed by Palestine based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Reports indicate that other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, a holy land for both countries, and issues concerning the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding that military deployments continue for 10 years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian National Authority is only agreeing to a 5-year deployment.
Marksmen in the pilot invasive species control reinforcement project will be closely supervised by forest rangers, as this pilot project will be monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), suitably qualified volunteers were selected under the Sporting Shooters' Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage at the park, along with NPWS, the four marksmen selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended that the earlier resignation of the CEP be part of the measures to lead the country to new elections.
Martelly appointed the commission in response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, which were sometimes due since 2011.
There have been approximately 60 reports of iPod malfunctions causing excessive heat, resulting in 6 fires and 4 minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they are aware of 27 accidents involving the device.
Last week, METI stated that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report presentation "highly unlikely."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 UTC on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management reported that there were no reports of damage within the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took a group of Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far, at least 6 deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first, along with a Filipino photographer.
Later, several photographers replaced the old woman because she had to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot and defeated.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began collecting data on premature labor during his free time.
His research shows that the use of hormones can accelerate the lung development of fetuses.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes,' which are flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Luna also received praise and admiration from her fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons, which was as unique as she was. She was a tough woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was just as crazy as I am...maybe even more so...I loved her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place now."
Of the 1,400 people who voted early in the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic upon the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who took the opinion poll want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
From a survey with extreme opinions, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist is expected to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as three relay events, at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaint has raised doubts about his physical fitness.
He can't use the medication he needs to overcome the pain because these medications are banned in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor from the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
By early February, multiple people had verified the findings using different hardware and software, and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water to Earth, along with organic compounds that could form proteins and aid in sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the formation of Earth, since it was struck by a comet a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called this rumor "political balderdash and foolishness".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes to travel on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
The technology used is satellite-based, which differs from older ground-based radar technology, to help air traffic controllers more accurately locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no additional transportation services, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. There is no parking available on-site, nor are there park-and-ride facilities.
Fears of transportation shortages make it likely that the game will be played quietly without team supporters.
A study published in a scientific journal on Thursday reported on the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that this new species evolved within just two generations, despite the belief that this process takes longer, as it is a hybrid between the native medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and the cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
We can shape gold into any form and roll it into miniature shapes.
Gold can be drawn into thin wires that can be twisted and woven into patterns, and it can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made into extremely thin sheets and applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, which are called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color according to the acidity or alkalinity of chemicals.
pH is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical substance being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has had its electron removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Combine the two dry powders together, then use clean, wet hands to squeeze and shape them into balls.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, causing a strange sensation and forming a crust-like layer.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of wastewater treatment systems have been discovered in homes in cities of the Minoan civilization of Crete and in Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses used jointly by men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, that means you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive signals and reflect them back down almost instantaneously.
Satellites are launched into space using rockets. Scientists need to use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere refracts light and distorts some of our view.
Giant rockets, taller than 100 feet, are required to carry satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways; the greatest thing it has done for us is to make transportation more convenient and faster.
It gives us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Following them are mid-sized tigers and lions, which prey on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Ultimately, numerous small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) prey on a wide variety of much smaller animals, such as insects, rodents, reptiles like lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of a home range, which is considered a specialized job that each cat adheres to in order to prevent them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A lion pride consists of one to three adult male lions, as well as up to 30 lionesses and cubs.
Being a large family consisting of sisters and daughters, females often have close relationships with each other.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, creatures surprisingly similar to lions (but less so than other big cats), and are equally dangerous to their prey.
Tigers are skilled athletes, capable of climbing (though not very well), swimming, long jumping, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers belong to the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera). These four cats are the only members of their family that can roar.
A tiger's roar is different from a lion's full-throated roar, being more like a series of threatening growls or shouts.
Wild cats like to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds. Almost all the animals that wild cats hunt are smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that wild cats track and stalk animals to eat (prey) by smelling where the prey has been on the ground.
Ocelots have excellent night vision, allowing them to see well in the dark, and they move cautiously. They hunt by camouflaging themselves in their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island where they cannot easily return to where they used to live), those organisms often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different qualities, or the ability to adapt in order to become stronger competitors than before.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all; they still need to adapt in the same way as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they will gradually look less and less like other populations.
After hundreds of thousands, or even millions of years, the two populations eventually look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which refers to the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and is considered an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants create food from the sun through photosynthesis, and also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes, and most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the ultimate predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its elongated jaw is lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with specialized teeth on the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that enters escapes.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been cannibalistic.
It also attacks anything that goes into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex is no match for it.
Although most of the food of the Romans is something we are already familiar with, the Romans themselves also had strange foods or bizarre menus for banquets, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and the woman ate sitting on chairs, the rich preferred to eat lavishly together, reclining sideways as they ate.
Foods that originated in America or Asia and entered Europe centuries later cannot be counted as food of the ancient Romans.
For example, ancient Romans had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built main temples that were considered homes for each god.
People would bring offerings to the gods, and priests would try to follow the gods' will through rituals and festivals.
Each Vihara has an open courtyard, followed by an inner Vihara accessible only to monks.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The spire is a special abode of the gods.
The weather in the Middle East is warm, so houses are not as important.
Jewish families mostly live outdoors.
The women will be cooking in the field. The shops are just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
The land of Canaan had no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Finland was only sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and traveling further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even though he was the discoverer, the Eskimo people were already living there at that time.
Even though each country is "Scandinavian," the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are very different.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it's still not a treasure map.
The text inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence reads, "Original Declaration of Independence Dated 4th July 1776," and appears at the bottom of the document when it is inverted.
Although no one knows for sure who the author is, we know that in its early life, this large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it's possible that notes have been added to the label format.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
This place was governed by the French from the "Vichy Regime," who were French people that made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded southern France. This invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany in just two weeks.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means civilian. It is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and also defines the size of a society.
City-states are a demonstration of nationhood, a flourishing culture that conveys the transmission of knowledge inherited across generations, the remaining footprints of culture, and equitable expansion.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence and without being recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first established a rudimentary central government under the Articles of Confederation, with a unicameral Congress.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it was forced to rely on the states, which were often uncooperative in enforcing its acts.
Furthermore, Congress has no power to repeal tax laws and customs duties between the states either.
The legal articles require unanimous consent from all states before they can be amended, and the states pay little attention to the central government; even the representatives of each state frequently do not attend.
The national football teams of Italy and Germany are considered the second most successful in the world, and both teams won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to Japan's land consisting of groups or archipelagos of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as "the archipelago."
Taiwan's origins can be traced back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in traditional grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty's forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
Following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, resulting in Japanese rule over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu, the ancient ruins of the Inca civilization, consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana stone, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the building complex have been reconstructed to give tourists the opportunity to see what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and repaired, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, a film size that played a significant role at the end of the analog film era.
This type of film is still being produced today, but the more important point is that the aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
Actually, the 35mm format, which has a width of 33mm and a height of 24mm, is quite confusing.
Therefore, the ratio of this form (dividing by 12 to make it the simplest integer ratio) can be expressed as 3:2.
Various common formats (e.g., formats in the APS family) have the same or approximately similar aspect ratios as this image.
The rule of thirds, which is greatly underestimated and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
which specifies that the most effective position for the main object is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was subjected to intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has connected the various states of Europe, despite their differences in language and traditions.
The far-reaching power affected everyone from the King to the commoners.
A key principle of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this religious belief has been followed.
Not long after the outbreak of war, Britain blockaded Germany's sea lanes.
The strategy has been proven effective by depriving both military and civilian populations of critical supplies, even though such a blockade violates generally accepted international laws codified by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering parts of the ocean, creating a hazard even for neutral vessels.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, most citizens and countries desired peace and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horror and brutality of World War I, nations were determined to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poems, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had unique ways of representing different time periods, dividing them into Chinese eras or dynasties – each ruling family with its own distinct characteristics.
The periods between dynasties were times of instability when various provinces were fragmented and independent. The most well-known period is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Fierce wars between numerous nobles vying for the throne erupted during these times.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the throne in the imperial palace in Xi'an.
The social and political impacts were numerous, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolute monarchy to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Following the revolution, various professions were also opened up to all male applicants, giving the most ambitious and successful the opportunity to prosper.
The same goes for the military, because instead of promoting based on seniority, they promote based on the size of the gun barrel.
Furthermore, the French Revolution inspired oppressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond the ordinary, and he often went to a cave later known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light) for meditation.
The cave, having survived through time, clearly demonstrates a spiritual inclination.
This cave is located on one of the peaks north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find it even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it's like being completely cut off from the outside world.
Besides the clear and beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, there was nothing else to see. Almost nothing could be seen or heard from the world while inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, this Great Pyramid is one of many massive pyramidal structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, consists of various pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "โบหงาย" symbol looks like the letter V, while the "โบว์คว่ำ" symbol looks like a staple or a square without its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip of the bow and draw the bow upwards, and down means you should start at the frog of the bow (where your hand is holding the bow) and draw the bow downwards.
Typically, drawing the violin bow upwards produces a softer sound, while drawing it downwards produces a more powerful and firm sound.
You can draw the markings yourself, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
King Louis XVI, the terrified Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to leave Versailles and return to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that jeered and threatened the King and Queen.
The crowd pressured the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, one of the crowd brandished the head of a murdered Swiss Guard in front of the terrified Queen at Versailles.
The Filipinos themselves had to pay the costs of the war to conquer the Philippines for American imperialism.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States' colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest from bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Certainly, the exorbitant profits derived from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people will count as a core benefit of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, we must understand the context that led to its founding.
The era in which this event occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, which encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) of European history.
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technology determinism is an umbrella term for various ideas ranging from technology push or technological imperative to the more precise sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and expressed in the form of technology.
Technological determinism interpretations largely share two common ideas: that technology develops primarily along a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has a "natural" impact on existing society rather than being shaped by social conditions.
For example, one might say that automobiles inevitably led to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network would not be economically viable if only a few cars were in use; therefore, new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Furthermore, the enormous number of car owners also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, which in turn has prompted the development of new techniques for repairing damaged car bodies.
Romanticism largely consists of the cultural subjectivity derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, traditions and cultures associated with that geography arise. These things, which are consistent with the society's location, are superior to laws that are arbitrarily imposed.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is famous as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
This place declined in status during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders sent back gifts, such as silk and spices, that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at that moment that the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most popular between the 10th and 11th centuries, and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, slow communication channels meant that Western styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western Europeans began to develop their own style, and one of the greatest developments of that time was the Crusaders' adoption of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple system that is often organic, using seeds native to the ecoregion, integrated with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced agriculture for self-sufficiency, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar mindsets who feel neglected by societal norms, and help them develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can exhibit distinct differences due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture's distinctiveness can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender-related, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often express their membership through distinctive styles that are specific symbols, such as fashion, mannerisms, and group-specific jargon, etc.
One of the most frequently used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to draw upon the cases of unfortunate children who have been abandoned, neglected, or victimized by deliberate abuse, and who have not received socialization from adults while growing up.
These types of children are called "troublemakers" or delinquents. Some delinquent children are confined by people (often their own parents). In some cases, child abandonment stems from parents' inability to accept their child's intellectual or physical disabilities.
Children who are feral may have experienced severe abuse in their youth or have deep-seated trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are even rumored to live alone in the forest.
When fully raised by non-human animals, feral children will exhibit behaviors (within physical limitations) almost identical to those of their caregiver animals, such as fear or disinterest in humans.
While project-based learning can make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding does even more than that.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support system for individuals who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and tangible. For example, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are built into the software itself and are designed to question, stimulate, and explain steps that students might find difficult to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment and abuse to coercion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet they do.
We understand that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide all the necessary items that were lacking in the child's home before they were taken into care.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet lead to further dimensions in terms of usage and methods of creating satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered significant motivations for internet usage (James et al., 1995).
When they examined audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" as emerging motivations.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries about the interpretation of fleeting facial expressions, which are facial movements that occur in milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that people can detect whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting fleeting micro-expressions.
In his research titled "Presidential Speeches," Oliver Sacks noted how individuals unable to comprehend speech due to brain damage could still assess sincerity.
He even pointed out that some types of animals, such as pet dogs, may also have these abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century indicated that there were two groups of genetic changes: those that were not expressed and those that were expressed.
Mutation has increased genetic diversity, and the process of selection has culled those variations from the expressed diversity.
Alternating periods of separation and reunification between the two generations.
In the savanna grasslands, mammals with digestive systems like humans would find it difficult to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Furthermore, the inability to do so may lead to serious consequences, including stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily accessible plant resource is likely protein, which can be found in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting these unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide protein with high amounts of all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, it's not surprising if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a way somewhat similar to what chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of waking up intentionally during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a quiet alarm clock that wakes you up feeling aware but not fully awake.
If you often snooze your alarm clock while sleeping, you can place the clock far away on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on circadian rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or teas known to be diuretics) before bed, which will cause you to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and mind.
The less stress you have, the more positive life energy you'll gain. Everyone has the potential to find true peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment; the only obstacles to this goal are our stress and negative outlook.
Tibetan Buddhism is rooted in the teachings of the Buddha, but incorporates Mahayana Buddhism and numerous yoga techniques from India.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces everything.
Kundalini yoga awakens Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga, where energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightenment awareness arises through the visualization of various deities.
Germany was a common enemy of the Soviet Union and the United States in World War II, leading to cooperation between the two countries. After the war ended, conflicts in systems, processes, and cultures caused friction between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and then the Cold War began.
It will last for another 40 years, and there will be real fighting by proxy armies in various battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is considered the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Originally, the navy's job was to ensure that its own country could maintain the ability to move people and goods, while hindering the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
A particularly notable recent example is the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II, where the Americans attempted to move personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid England.
Meanwhile, the German Navy, relying mainly on U-boats, was trying to stop this transportation.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer England, having successfully seized the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Generally, domestic goats are raised in herds that roam the hills or other pastures, similar to the more well-known sheep herding practices, with goat herders often being children or teenagers. This method of herding is still used today.
The wheel lock was invented in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the cart track consisted only of parallel planks, it allowed horse-drawn carts to accelerate and pull more weight than on the slightly rougher roads of that era.
Rail pads were introduced relatively early to secure the rails in place; however, it was later gradually realized that the rails would be more effective with steel on top.
This has become common practice, but the iron causes the wooden wheels of the carts to wear out even more.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels, and in 1767, all-iron rails were used for the first time.
The first mode of transportation known to humans was walking. Humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (Homo Erectus means upright man).
Australopithecus, their ancestor, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, however, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way by joining environmental movements and even becoming activists, in order to alleviate the suffering that will occur in the future to some extent.
This is like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is clear enough that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of mankind, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyles.
After being approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by John Hancock, President of the Congress, and Charles Thomson, Secretary, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located just a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, approximately 150 to 200 copies were produced, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadside."
John Nixon read this document publicly for the first time at Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which he read to the troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving copies of the Declaration of Independence are the oldest remaining copies of this document; the original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many modern paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and live today; we call those dinosaurs birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds have many things that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs just like a T-Rex.
Almost every computer in use today relies on data management that is written as code in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
Internal toxins may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are common and not immediately diagnostic.
The best indication that a poison has been ingested may be an open container of medication or a poisonous household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists formally refer to this group of insects as beetles.
This word comes from the familiarity with bedbugs since ancient times, as bedbugs are insects that are very well adapted to clinging to and living on the human body.
Both blowflies and bed bugs are helpless when they hatch and must adapt to living in the nest or habitat of their caretaker.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 people with multiple sclerosis (or MS), making it one of the leading countries with neurological diseases among adolescents and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis or MS.
The couple decided that raising a baby was not something they wanted for themselves or for their child.
This couple may choose to have children by planning for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parent(s) relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which is essentially the standard approach for almost all scientific research.
However, it's not the only method. Experimentation and testing are forms of investigation used to eliminate at least one possible hypothesis by asking questions, and observation is also an approach in scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers were interested in ancient Greek and Roman texts, and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's perspective has been accepted in all branches of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the Western world found itself cut off from the philosophical and scientific foundations of the Greeks.
The many rhythms observed in biological mechanisms and behavior often depend on the existence of internal bodily cycles and their operation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms (not just responses to periodic external cues) have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues to function independently even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was a crucial clue indicating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, either labeling the DNA in phages with radioactive phosphorus or labeling the protein of phages with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations vary depending on the type of mutation, the important characteristics of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a germ cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere may cause cell death or become cancerous.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including trees and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, garden tours, and learning about ecosystems.
For example, visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small rural towns towards work, against the flow of people heading to work in the places they just left.
In this dynamic public transportation ecosystem, everyone participates or contributes to private car travel in one way or another.
Current science indicates that this massive carbon-based economic system has destabilized the Earth's environment and atmosphere, which had supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, you would hardly hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why does the transportation system generate so many complaints? Why are there failures every day? Are the transportation system's engineers incompetent, or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of movement between two points of individual drivers and vehicles, and the interactions both have with each other.
It's a pity that studying traffic fluidity is difficult, as driver behavior is something that cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave relatively similarly, so traffic flow tends to be fairly consistent, allowing for a rough mathematical estimation.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, a relationship is defined between three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air, and the ability to fly helps them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the length of their body.
Help them have more diverse small places to hide from predators.
Currently, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some agree with his idea, but many others believe the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, because the world doesn't feel like it's moving at all, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, with a water volume more than 8 times greater than the second largest river.
Furthermore, the Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, with some sections reaching up to six miles wide.
20 percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and is the confluence of water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, the size and technical excellence in the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza remain unsurpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed to see the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of around 800, making it the smallest independent country and the least populated in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian for its laws and official communications.
Most people who work in the Vatican use Italian as their everyday language, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these can be found in nature in their native forms and are also relatively easy to mine using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. But he also theorized that they would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Generally, alloys are combinations of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Additionally, you may have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe originates from matter. All matter originates from minuscule particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that millions of trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, pencils are good companions for many people when they're released onto the market.
Sadly, as new forms of writing gradually emerged, the importance and use of pencils diminished.
People today can write messages on computer screens without ever needing to go near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that splitting a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons releases energy.
It's like pushing a mortar up a mountain; splitting the nucleus again will release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they are likely to break apart from slight disturbances, or perhaps without any disturbance at all.
The surface of the moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon's surface is called the crust.
The near side crust is about 70 km thick, while the far side crust is about 100 km thick.
The Moon's crust is thinner in the maria (lunar seas) and thicker in the highlands.
The near side might have more maria because its crust is thinner, allowing lava to erupt to the surface more easily.
The theoretical content focuses on investigating what makes people choose or become interested.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that arise within them as they grow into adulthood.
These theories consider what makes some people want what they have done and what in their environment makes them take action or not take certain actions.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are potentially two behaviors that can occur when a manager leads former colleagues: on the one hand, trying to be "one of them" (or her).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
Conversely, one person transforms into an unrecognizable figure who feels they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Regardless of how it happened, leaders must be responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This kind of behavior often leads to friction between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for closely-knit, physical groups.
They tend to have more self-starters than traditional team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which local management may not understand.
Having a truly "phantom team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a specific component of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" is a management team where all members must report. The Invisible Team will set standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across departments with different functions throughout the organization, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
Therefore, organizational processes that work together to overcome obstacles can lead to new, innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be proactive, leadership must foster a culture of initiative and innovation, coupled with knowledge sharing and internal learning.
Angel (2006) explains that the Continuum approach is a method for helping organizations successfully achieve higher performance.
Neuroscientific data provides physical evidence for researching cognitive processes in theory, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior will support scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, including injuries, lesions, and tumors, affect behavior and cause alterations in certain mental functions.
The increasing availability of new technologies allows us to visualize and examine the structure and function of brain areas previously unseen.
This gives us a wealth of data and content to create situation models, which helps us understand processes in the mind.
While AI systems clearly have undertones of science fiction, they are also a very important branch of computer science in dealing with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
AI research involves enabling machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning, and scheduling; the ability to respond to customer feedback and questions; and recognizing handwriting, speech, and faces.
These things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing real-life solutions.
Currently, AI systems are often used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into software applications for home computers and various video games.
Field trips are an important part of every class, and teachers often take their students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing virtual field trip experiences is a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina designed a website documenting their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but older versions remain available online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with imperfect grammar and spelling, having an audience generally helps to correct those errors.
Since students are often the most important reader group, the blogger has begun to heavily improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "encourages students to better understand the world around them." The desire to meet the interests of readers inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and promotes further learning for students outside of regular class time.
Proper use of blogs "can encourage students to analyze and critique more, helping them position themselves within the context of others' writing through active responses to online content, as well as summarize their own views on a given issue" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's bilingual capital, charming and lined with galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Farther south is Niagara Falls, while to the north lies the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These things and others make Ontario stand out as the heart of Canada in the eyes of outsiders.
The vast area in the remote north is sparsely populated, and some parts are so desolate that almost no one lives there.
A surprising population comparison is that the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
With Madagascar being the largest island, and so much larger than other islands, it could be considered a continent in terms of its flora and fauna.
Most of the small islands are independent nations or have ties to France and are known for their luxurious beachfront resorts.
Furthermore, the Arabs brought Islam to various lands and it gained great popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route around the capes from Europe to India.
The northern part of the country borders the Sahel, while the south and west are bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: I recommend that all female tourists say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring would be beneficial (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead them to perceive certain actions as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used the site as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed this place and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt this city, naming it Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in Morocco.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and many other trinkets, but all of it is only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo, burying almost all of the city's roads, especially in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, if you plan to travel outside of Goma, it is advisable to research beforehand to understand the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
This city is still a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as for the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can get around Goma by boda-boda (motorcycle taxi), with the typical local price being around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" became a metaphor for a distant and exotic land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist destination with an airport.
In 1990, this site was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of sand from the desert.
This is one of the important stopover points during Henry Louis Gates' PBS series "Africa's Great Civilizations."
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabian atmosphere than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, running along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border bordering the Crocodile River.
This park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 distinct ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's premier tourist destinations and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Conservation fees and daily park entrance fees are collected, similar to other national parks in South Africa.
Furthermore, purchasing a Wild Card might be more worthwhile as it grants access to all national parks in South Africa, allowing you to visit some or all of them as desired (1).
Hong Kong Island is what makes Hong Kong famous and is also considered a primary focus for many tourists.
The buildings that stand in a row, creating the Hong Kong skyline, are likened to a glowing bar graph made easily visible by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of the urban development in Hong Kong is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coastline.
This is where the British colonists seized and claimed as their own. So, if you're looking for evidence of this colony's past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching about 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just mangroves; there are also remnants of a large forest that once covered the Ganges River plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 sq km, about one-third of which is covered by water/swampy areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and is currently estimated to be home to around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interprovincial bus station (across the river) throughout the day. Generally, buses heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
It's recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance, as intercity buses often fill up quickly.
In most areas, there are comfortable and reliable small Japanese Coaster buses providing service.
Taxi sharing is a convenient and fast way to travel to nearby destinations. For example, to Paro Town (150 Nu) and to Punakha Town (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two tower pylons soar to a height of 83 meters, with a length of 378 meters, and consist of 2 lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge is 15 meters above the ground below. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to the public until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, which is when the Brazilian customs post is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous group living in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, subsisting as semi-nomadic hunters who practice agriculture.
The Chaco region was once inhabited by other indigenous peoples such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once dubbed "the giant province of the Indies," emerged from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated the age of colonialism, which lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has retained many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament will be held in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be viewed here at other times of the year.
For news and information regarding the polo tournament and where to purchase tickets for entry, please check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo (Argentine Polo Association).
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, opposite FIC West.
Generally, British Pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, including for use with Stanley credit cards, and US Dollars are also often accepted.
It's possible that the outer islands may not accept credit cards, even if they accept British and American currency. Check with the owners in advance to determine accepted methods of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency off the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, when the Northern Hemisphere is in winter, it is summer there, and when the Northern Hemisphere is in summer, it is winter there.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region, and temperatures exceeding 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be unexpectedly cold. That is to say, even though the temperature itself hardly drops below freezing, the wind and humidity will make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; rainfall is fairly consistent throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park rangers advise staying at least 100 yards or meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards or meters away from all other wildlife.
No matter how tame they may seem, gaurs, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they fail to keep a safe distance. These animals are large, fierce, and potentially dangerous, so it's important to give them space.
In addition, be aware that various smells will attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and always keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the harbor.
Every ship was sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence established by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the assassination of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, a high chief.
There are many beaches because Auckland has two harbors on opposite sides. The most popular beaches are in three main areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These beaches are mostly safe for swimming with plenty of sand, and many have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on the Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Sometimes these beaches are crowded family beaches with shops lining the shore, and swimming is safe.
The leading local beer brand is 'Number One,' which isn't a complex beer, but it has a pleasant taste and a refreshing feel. Another local beer brand is called "Manta" (1).
There are many unmissable French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better suited for travel.
The tap water in this area is safe to drink, but if you're concerned, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the 'flat white' is unremarkable, a 'short black' is just an 'espresso,' a cappuccino must have a mound of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is considered up to Belgian standards, and the juice is expensive but tastes very good.
Throughout the year, there are many trips to coral reefs, and injuries stemming from these activities at the reefs are rarely encountered.
However, seek advice from officials, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770; they can occasionally be found outside of those times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely harm humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean; their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with hotels already, but you can still book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through them as well.
Typically, travel agencies offer packages that include breakfast and transportation to/from the airport, or even packages with airfare and hotel.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your trip (e.g., visa).
If you need to make any changes or requests, you should do so through your travel agent and not contact the hotel directly.
At some music festivals, attendees will camp on-site, as most see it as a key part of the experience.
If you want to have a close-up experience, you'll need to arrive early to find a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage may be over, some parts of the festival will continue to play music until late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
It is advisable to check the location of your cabin when traveling across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can create quite frightening noises for those most likely to be affected.
A St. Petersburg cruise also includes time in the city, with visa waivers for passengers (conditions apply, please check).
Casinos generally try very hard to get all guests to spend as much money and time as possible, often having no windows or clocks and making it difficult to find exits.
They often offer food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and staying at the venue.
Some establishments serve alcoholic beverages; however, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers recognize the importance of being able to maintain a clear head.
Anyone who has to drive in high-altitude areas or across mountains should prepare for snow, ice, or temperatures that drop to freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, making it impossible to drive like you would on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, snow can fall so heavily that you can become stranded in a very short time.
Visibility may be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
Conversely, cold and snowy weather is commonplace in many countries, and traffic generally flows smoothly throughout the year.
Safari might be the biggest tourist draw and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term "safari" refers to an overland journey to observe the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savanna grasslands.
Some types of animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are prone to approaching vehicles, and standard equipment will help with good visibility.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy, and you'll see them more clearly with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "safari walk," or "walking safari") consists of hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held in 2021 from August 24th to September 5th, with some events taking place at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, following its hosting of the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might be experiencing some difficult situations.
Cancellation policies varied, but by late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies would not extend to July 2020, once the Olympics had been rescheduled.
Tickets are expected to range in price from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with general admission tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels offer ironing board and iron rentals, even if they are not in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you might try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the iron get too hot (which may cause shrinkage or, in severe cases, scorching).
There are various methods for purifying water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough; in others, it's necessary to boil it for several minutes.
Filtration systems vary in effectiveness, which is something you should pay attention to, and you should consider buying bottled water from reputable companies.
Tourists may encounter nuisance animals that they are not familiar with in the region that is their home.
Pests cause food loss, create nuisance, or, in worse cases, can cause allergies, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Creatures that transmit diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people with force are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from VAT and excise taxes in certain areas.
Sometimes, tourists traveling to countries with high taxes can significantly reduce expenses, especially when purchasing alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The long stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through desolate, wooded terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, prepare yourself for various challenging situations, mainly steep inclines, narrow lanes, and hairpin turns.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections, which are typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence is paramount.
But it's curious that the mobile phone service here has a much stronger signal than other places along the same route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite delicious, and in Bavaria, there's a relatively large and diverse selection, similar to the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are commonplace, with apples being used year-round, while cherries and plums are available in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with strong-flavored coffee.
If you're looking for a small pastry with intense flavor, try a pastry called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a type of dish made primarily from herbs and spices, cooked together with meat or various vegetables.
Curries can be either "dry" or "with gravy", depending on the amount of liquid.
In northern India and Pakistan, far from the sea, yogurt is often added to curries, while coconut milk is more commonly used in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, the term "Indonesian food" is a broad one, encompassing regional cuisines from across the country.
However, if used without any other qualifiers, the word is likely to refer to food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, consists of simply seasoned dishes. The distinctive flavorings of Javanese food include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and fragrant spices.
Stirrups are for supporting the rider's feet hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
This makes the rider more stable, but there may be safety concerns as the rider's feet could get stuck inside.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot remains caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged by the horse if it runs away. Several safety measures can be taken to reduce this risk.
Firstly, most drivers wear heeled boots with smooth, narrow soles.
Furthermore, some saddle models, particularly English saddles, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if pulled by a rider falling from the horse.
Cochamó Valley is a premier climbing destination in Chile, often called the Yosemite of South America, boasting massive granite walls and cliffs.
That mountain peak offers breathtaking views at the summit, and climbers from around the world are constantly forging new routes amidst potentially endless obstacles.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity enjoyed by many, sometimes referred to as "ski bumming," which involves planning an entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The concept of skiing dates back to ancient times, with cave paintings indicating the existence of skiers as early as 5,000 BC.
Competitive downhill skiing has existed since at least the 17th century, and Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in 1861 in Australia.
Backpacking with skis, also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
This type of skiing might be categorized as a similar activity to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it is not typically related; alpine skiing takes place on steeper terrain and requires much sturdier skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as being like a hiking trail.
In good condition, you'll be able to cover a greater distance than walking, but you rarely have the chance to experience the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack on a groomed track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean applying for multiple visas and going through multiple passport controls.
However, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you are within this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa from each member country within the Schengen area, which saves time, money, and reduces the paperwork required.
There is no universal definition to pinpoint which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
Definitions vary by geography, with age limits potentially lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicraft products may be designated as antiques even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important way of life among the Sami people and surrounding cultures, and trade is also important for many other occupations as well.
However, not all Sami people farmed and raised large numbers of reindeer, even traditionally. They also lived by fishing, hunting, and similar pursuits, mainly using reindeer as draft animals.
Currently, many Sámi people work in modern commerce, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi areas of Sápmi.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Roma people, the term "Gypsy" is often considered inappropriate due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting has travel advisories, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
Furthermore, you might want to seek advice from governmental bodies other than those in your country, but that advice will be tailored to the citizens of that country.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Those recommendations are only a brief overview of the political situation in one country.
The perspectives presented are often superficial, general information and oversimplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a common term used to describe dangerous weather phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many types of severe weather depending on geographical location, terrain, and climate.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are various forms and impacts of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.

Typically, a course lasts 2-5 days and involves role-playing, first aid methods, and may sometimes include weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications related to war zones are not.
Travelers planning gender confirmation surgery abroad must ensure they carry all unexpired documents needed for their return trip.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents that update information to match preferred names and genders.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies just as widely.
In the post-9/11 era, security screenings at checkpoints became increasingly intrusive.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through screening devices without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are currents flowing away from the shore, caused by waves that have broken on the beach flowing back out to sea, often occurring in areas with coral reefs or similar structures.
Underwater topography causes stronger return currents at greater depths, and fast-flowing currents into deep water may form there.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion while trying to swim against the current back, which is something that may not be possible.
As soon as you're out of the current, swimming back isn't any more difficult than usual.
Try aiming for a spot where you won't get stuck, otherwise you might end up waiting for help, depending on your skills and whether someone notices you.
Reverse culture shock tends to happen faster (shorter initial phase), last longer, and can be more intense than culture shock.
Tourists who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes face difficulties, especially in readjusting to their own native culture.
Having lived abroad, upon returning home, you've already adapted to a new culture and forgotten some customs of your home culture.
When you go abroad, people are often patient and understanding at first because they know that those traveling to a new country need to adjust.
People may not realize that patience and empathy are also necessary for travelers who are returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in this area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can see them in the quiet moments before the show begins.
Normally, you can always hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The story of the sights and sounds is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is cast as the backdrop and narrator of this long tale.
The scene will appear on the pyramids, and the pyramids will light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by several nations, are the islands with the most bases, with 16 still in operation in 2020.
This archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still-active volcanic caldera provides stunning natural harbor views.
Ellsworth Land is a territory south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merge with the high plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountain range in Antarctica, which is the Vinson Massif with Mount Vinson reaching a height of 4,892 meters.
In remote locations with no cell phone service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Generally, satellite phones are not a replacement for mobile phones because they require an unobstructed line of sight to a satellite in an open area to make calls.
This service is frequently used for transportation, including cruise ships and exploration that requires both data and audio from a distance.
Your local telephone provider should be able to provide information about connecting this service.
A more popular option for those planning a gap year is traveling and learning.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before entering university without impacting their education.
In many cases, registering for a gap year program abroad can increase your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Generally, there are tuition fees for registration in these learning programs.
Finland is a fantastic paddling destination. This "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in its lakes and in its archipelago along the coast.
You don't need a yacht in the islands and lakes.
While the largest coastal and lake archipelagos are wide enough for yachts to navigate, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different kind of experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with about one boat for every seven or eight Finns.
Which is the same as Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it's also quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is 1 in 40).
Most prominent Baltic cruises make extended port calls in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can spend a full two to three days visiting the historical city and come back to sleep on the boat at night.
If you disembark for shore excursions only as part of a cruise, you don't need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships feature images of Berlin, Germany in their brochures, but as you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
This is not something to be ashamed of. It's no different from fear and dislike of other things, based on personal feelings that many people have.
For some, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear rooted in ignorance or a lack of control.
Shipping companies are well compensated for delivering things quickly; often, time is of the essence with business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but there are problems for other routes and smaller companies.
If shipping a parcel via air transport, transshipment and customs clearance may take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster is to check it as baggage, but airline regulations don't allow unaccompanied baggage, which is why you need to be there.
The common way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a large sum of money for this privilege (or better yet, have your company pay for it).
However, these services don't come cheap. A rough calculation using general principles leads you to expect that for business class, you'll pay up to four times the normal economy fare, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in trying to find discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a core group of air travelers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly for the services they provide.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of a self-proclaimed republic called Transnistria, located in eastern Moldova. This territory has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
The two Moldovan territories have re-established economic ties, even though a political agreement has not been possible.
The majority of the population in Moldova are adherents of the Orthodox Christian faith.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey. With a population of approximately 3.7 million, it is the second-largest port after Istanbul and a major transportation hub.

The Parisians' rude demeanor will quickly disappear when you show them basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is a densely wooded area dominated by beech, fir, and spruce trees, with a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
This area has diverse plant communities due to a wide range of microclimates, resulting in varied soil compositions and elevations.

By the same standard, men must also wear long pants that cover the knees.
These are also available for loan from the depot at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after every use, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all!

Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete, but they remain standing as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution during the era when it was a severe problem wasn't the same as the problems we face today, these issues often occurred in cities or educational institutions, which were more accessible than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are colossal instruments located in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, or what is known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
