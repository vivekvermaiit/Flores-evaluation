This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but also provides information on details, such as color and 3-dimensional arrangement, that we usually cannot obtain from fossils.
Scientists say that this animal has chestnut-brown plumage on the outside and a pale carrot color on the inside.
The research also provides information about the evolution of flight feathers.
Dinosaurs lack the rachis, the central shaft found in bird feathers, but they possess other feather features – barbs and barbules – leading scientists to infer that the rachis likely evolved later in the evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure suggests it was used for temperature regulation or display rather than combat. Researchers suggest that even though this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen represents an adult plumage and not that of a juvenile.
Researchers advised that even though this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen indicates an adult plumage, and not that of a hatchling.

They discovered that the Sun, like other stars, operates on the same fundamental principles. The activity of stars within a system depends on their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic reversal.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made in the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The group was focused on studying the effects of tidal forces from dark matter in the Milky Way and dark matter between galaxies.
Just as the gravitational pull between the moon and the Earth causes tides in the ocean, there is gravitational attraction between the Milky Way galaxy and the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
Scientists have successfully demonstrated that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a kind of luminous halo around the galaxy and is made up of numerous small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience; voters isolate themselves in a polling booth, mark their preferred candidate on a pre-printed ballot, and place it in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter deposits the ballot envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
France's election law meticulously codifies the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the voting process, and that no envelopes other than properly counted and authorized voter envelopes are placed inside.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under tight security, following a specific procedure.

In the women's seated category, four skiers were unable to finish their race, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to secure a ranking in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested 5 people who raped the Swiss woman and also seized her mobile phone and laptop from them."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Even though there were 3 people inside the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.
However, the driver survived a serious head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Following that, he was transferred again to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeokoya remains in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, facing charges related to the murder of her son.
She has pending charges and a trial. However, because her photograph has been widely publicized, eyewitness testimony may be tainted.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scots law operates differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University noted that, "If journalists publish photos of a suspect, etc., it's like walking a dangerous line."
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the case, has indicated to journalists that no comment will be made until further charges are filed.
According to the leaks, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other reportedly included topics are the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel has demanded that its current military base in the valley be allowed to remain for 10 years, while the PA has agreed to only 5 years.
The ranger closely monitored the shooter in the auxiliary pest control test while the test's observation and utility were being evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were appointed under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the new 9-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sometimes, these violent demonstrations arise from the failure to hold elections, some of which haven't been held since 2011.
Complaints have been registered regarding a total of 60 iPods that are malfunctioning and overheating, including six incidents of fire and four incidents of minor burns to people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious".
Apple's delaying of the report was met with a "truly regrettable" reaction from the ministry.
Mariana experienced an earthquake at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office has stated that there has been no damage reported anywhere in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists and held them hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists with his M16 rifle.
So far, many hostages have been rescued, and at least 6 deaths have been recorded.
Six hostages, including young children and senior citizens, were released as quickly as the Filipino photographer.
The photographer took the elderly woman's place as she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza had been shot.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in the medical field.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his free time.
His research showed that if the hormone was administered, it would accelerate the maturity of the baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday seized two 'black box' flight recorders.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with 2 moons. One of a kind, just like her. A powerful woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as me...maybe even more so...I love her and I'm going to miss her...hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she wanted Australia to become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
Of those who participated in the vote, 34 percent expressed the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Taking a polarized view on voting, a survey revealed that 29 percent of people believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and 3 relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical fitness seemed doubtful due to his complaints.
Due to the ban in sports, he couldn't take the medicines that would help him overcome his injury.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Many people, using different hardware and software, verified the authenticity of the discovery since the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are likely sources that distributed water, along with organic matter, to Earth, which could have formed proteins and supported life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, when comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began serving as governor earlier this year and signed a bill into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
They called the rumors "idle political chatter and foolishness".
It was anticipated that he would run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
To enable air traffic controllers to give more precise instructions to aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information, this uses satellite-based technology, which is completely opposite to the previous ground-based radar technology.
There will be no extra transport running, and Overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and park-and-ride facilities will also not be available at the ground.
The possibility of the game being forced to be played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans, has increased due to fears of inadequate transportation.
An observation about the emergence of new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands was published in the Science journal on Thursday.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have stated that new species have been observed to evolve in as little as two weeks, but the process is likely to take longer due to breeding between the local Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortis*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be molded into any shape. It can be wrapped into a small size.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be coiled, and it can be made into sheets. This metal can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made extremely small and embedded in other metals. It can be made so small that it was used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books, which were called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons because they have had their electron removed (as hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix 2 dry powders together, and then squeeze it into a ball with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a fun experience and forming a kind of shell.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women participated together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Communication is established with satellites in space, and they respond almost immediately.
This satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with the light and views we want to see.
A giant rocket taller than 100 feet is required to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
Because of this, we obtained railways, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Internally, they have more medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals ranging from hares to deer and antelope.
Ultimately, there are many feral cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that consume a variety of small prey such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, where each cat has a specific role that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Women often have very close relationships with each other, with sisters and daughters forming a large family.
Lion prides behave much like packs of canids, with a surprising resemblance in their behavior to jackals and dogs (but not other big cats), and are extremely lethal in their hunting.
A perfectly skilled tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a healthy human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar; these are the only four cat species that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like a phrased sentence uttered with a snarl and a scream.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if possible. All the animals that ocelots hunt are smaller in size than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt and locate prey by their scent, smell, tracking, and finding where they are on the ground to eat them.
They can see very well in the darkness of night and move stealthily with great ease. Ocelots blend into their surroundings to hunt their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from their original population (such as when they migrate across a mountain range or river, or relocate to a new island, making it difficult for them to return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than were previously required to become a strong competitor.
There has been no change in the original population, and they still need to adapt as they did before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look less like its original population.
Eventually, even after thousands or millions of years, two populations can look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans use for breathing, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (breathe out).
Trees make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our houses and make our clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals cannot survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaw was lined with over 70 sharp teeth, with an extra set in the upper part of his mouth, meaning there was no escape for anyone who came his way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a spiky tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been cannibalistic.
He attacked anything that entered the water; even a massive dinosaur like a T. Rex couldn't compare to it.
Much of their food would be familiar to you, but Roman feasts included a share of strange and unusual items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, wealthy people preferred to eat together, where they comfortably enjoyed their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include food that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa powder, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their deities, which was considered the house of the god.
People brought items to offer to the gods, and priests tried to fulfill the requirements of deity worship through festivals and ceremonies.
Every temple has an open courtyard, and only the priest can enter the inner sanctum.
Sometimes, distinctive pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of these temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not very important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their life in the open air.
Women used to cook in the courtyard; shop counters would be open on the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests on the Canaanite land, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland became a sparsely populated region. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and after traveling a little further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living in that place at that time.
Even if every country was 'Scandinavian', there are still many differences in the people, kings, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map written on its back.
However, that's not true. Even though something is written on the back of this document, it's not a treasure map.
"These words were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence: ""Original Declaration of Independence of 4th July 1776"". This text appears at the bottom of the document, in the opposite direction."
Nobody knows who wrote this, but it is known that in his early life, large parchment documents (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) were brought in for storage.
So, it could be that this notation was simply applied as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
The "Vichy" French were ruling over it. These French had established peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated instead of fighting the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France in an assault called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a large community of people who live together in society and work cooperatively.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, relating to the Latin city or city-state, and to some extent defines the expansion of society.
City-states were the precursors to countries, indicating a slow cultural gait and proper allocation, suggesting the passage of knowledge across generations within a civilized urban culture.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper cultures.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states formed a weak central government - with the Congress being its only significant part - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and lacking a national executive or judiciary, it was dependent on state officials, who often did not cooperate in enforcing its laws.
He did not have the authority to override tax laws between states.
Before this law could be amended, unanimous consent from all the states was required, and the states did not take the central government seriously at all, with their representatives often being absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions of Italy, where Italians participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is an archipelago of approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the 7th largest island country in the world.
Due to its archipelago nature, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming indigenous grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to cultivate rice and sugarcane there.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which they ceded their claim to Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes 3 main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
To give tourists a better idea of what the old buildings looked like in their original form, most of them have been reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common steel image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant format of the last films of the analog film era.
It is still being made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, as it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
This format is understood to have an aspect ratio of 3:2 (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio).
Many common formats (e.g., APS family formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third party's extremely strict and often sarcastic rules are simple guidelines that create dynamism while maintaining order in the composition of a photograph.
This suggests that the most effective spot for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, began to be scrutinized.
For thousands of years, Christianity had bound European nations together, despite differences in language, customs, and traditions.
His all-encompassing power influenced everyone, from the king to the commoners.
A key principle in Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial resources are specifically for that purpose.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church was in Rome, and this centralization of power and money led many to question whether this doctrine truly existed.
Following the outbreak of hostilities, Britain immediately initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
While this blockade may have violated commonly accepted international laws, codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries, this strategy proved effective by reducing crucial military and civilian supplies.
Britain mined a large area of the ocean, in international waters (a part of the ocean not under any country's jurisdiction), to ban ships from entering an entire section of the ocean.
Because this tactic received a limited response, Germany expected its unrestricted submarine warfare to receive a similar one.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of peace and isolationism.
Having witnessed the atrocities and horrors of World War I, all nations expressed a desire to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents in his hand and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former manager).
Ancient China had a peculiar way of indicating time periods; each stage or ruling family of China belonged to a specific dynasty.
Similarly, there was a volatile period of fragmented territories between each dynasty. The best known of these periods was the 60-year period between the Han and Jin dynasties, consisting of 3 kingdoms.
During this period, there was a terrible war among many royal contenders vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period in ancient Chinese history was one of the bloodiest eras, with thousands dying in the battle for the supreme throne in the magnificent palaces of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that a nation belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, many business opportunities were available to male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as seniority in the armed forces will be based on merit rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many exploited working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequently visited a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) in search of enlightenment.
Their extended stay in the cave provided a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
This cave, located on one of the mountain ranges north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, even if someone knows it exists, it's not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave, it's like being completely isolated.
From inside the cave, only a small part of the world can be seen or heard. Besides the surrounding mountains and the clear, beautiful sky above, nothing else is visible.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
Egypt's Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's consorts and family members.
"The "up bow" mark looks like a V, and the "down bow mark" looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing."
Up means you start from the tip and move the bow forward, and down means you start from the frog (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
Up-bow typically produces a soft sound, while down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to use a pencil to alter the markings to your own symbols, but remember that there are printed bow markings for musical reasons, so it is usually necessary to give importance to them.
A frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were brought back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
In the carriage, the King and Queen made their return journey to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people dangerously screaming and shouting against them.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows.
In a crowd, an individual killed a Versailles royal guard and danced his head in front of the terrified queen.
The cost of the US's imperialist war of conquest against the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American imperial system to cover a large portion of the spending and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the substantial benefits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one needs to understand the context that inspired the order's creation.
The period in which the event occurred is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages of European history, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came before the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technology determination is a term that practically encompasses broad ideas, from the technology-push or technological perspective, in the strict sense, to the fundamental logic by which human destiny is linked to scientific laws and driven by the expression of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development follows its own path, independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially constructed.
For example, we might say that the development of roads was possible only because of the motor car.
However, a nationwide network of roads is not economically viable for just a few cars, so many new production methods have been developed to reduce the price of cars.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, requiring the healthcare system to innovate new technologies to handle the injured and deceased.
Cultural determination was presented by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel as a major element of romanticism.
In the context of culinary appreciation, geographical conditions shaped people, and over time, customs and cultures related to that region developed, which were better than arbitrarily imposed laws because they were consistent with the society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of federal Europe.
It began to be known as a center of luxury around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its condition deteriorated during the 12th century, primarily due to the Crusaders returning silk and spice gifts, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
This was the time when the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style originated between the 10th and 11th centuries and reached its peak in the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture from the East heavily influenced clothing.
However, due to the slow speed of communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, one of the biggest developments of that time was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that a farmer undertakes solely to meet the needs of themselves and their family, producing just enough food for survival.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses native, conserved seeds adapted to the local environment, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for increased production.
Historically, many farmers practiced agriculture as a means of subsistence, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary due to age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or the gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be language, aesthetics, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, geographical location, or a combination of various factors.
Members of subcultures display their membership through distinct and symbolic styles, including fashion, customs, and dialect.
The most common method used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to tell unfortunate stories of young children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, are not integrated by adults as they grow up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children have been abandoned because parents have denied the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Violent children are likely to have experienced significant child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are considered to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the forest of their own accord.
A child raised by animals other than humans often exhibits behavior (within the limits of their physical capabilities) similar to the specific animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While experiment-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, Machan goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals navigating new learning experiences, such as computer programs or starting a new project.
Mentors can be virtual or real; in other words, even the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office, like a teacher, is a mentor.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and are designed to ask questions, prompt action, and explain processes that students find challenging, preventing them from getting stuck.
Young children are placed in foster care for many reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even abandonment.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where there is no nurturing, care, and education, but they do grow up in such conditions.
We recognize the foster care system as a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide all the necessary things that were lacking in the previous home.
The internet brings together elements that are both collective and interconnected.
The internet's unique characteristics lead to further perspectives on aspects such as its uses and the satisfaction it provides.
For example, "e-learning" and "socialization" have been indicated as significant motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"When Egger and McCord (1998) investigated audience response on websites, they identified 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationship' as new motivating factors."
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in deciphering facial expressions, particularly subtle expressions that last for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can discern whether a person is lying by properly analyzing subtle gestures.
In his paper 'The President's Speech,' Oliver Sacks stated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
They also suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior might exist in animals like domestic dogs.
20th-century research has revealed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variation, and selection sorts it from the pool of existing variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle back and forth between 2 pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for those with human-like digestive systems to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Failure to do so henceforth can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Easily available plant-based sources are the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for humans like us to digest until they are cooked.
In contrast, non-vegetarian food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a large amount of protein containing all amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if we find out that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savannas do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of deliberately waking up during a normal sleep period and returning to sleep after a period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that doesn't fully wake you up easily.
If you think you reset the alarm clock in your sleep, you could keep it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based strategies include consuming plenty of fluids before bed (primarily water or tea, known diuretics), which forces a person to wake up to urinate.
The extent to which a person possesses inner peace is determined by the level of tension existing within their body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive life energy exists. Every person has the potential to achieve complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can acquire knowledge, but one's own stress and negativity stand as obstacles in the path to that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it incorporates the Mahayana path of compassion and numerous tantras from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path to achieving love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of self-realization) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Dev Yog is the central point of Tibetan meditation. Through the vision of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and self-realization consciousness is created.
During World War II, the USSR and the USA became allies because Germany was a common enemy. At the end of the war, they separated due to differences in systems, methodologies, and cultural perspectives.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
This was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and the fight for its reality would be waged by proxy armies from Africa to Asia on battlefields in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup near the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered virtually obsolete overnight when the Soviet Union's Red Army, numbering 800,000 soldiers, entered Poland's eastern territories after its invasion, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts.
Ships are the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The traditional role of navies is to maintain the ability to transport people and goods of their own country, while simultaneously interfering with the ability of their enemies to transport people and goods.
A notable recent example of this is the WWII North Atlantic campaign, where the Americans were trying to move people and supplies to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
If the Allied forces had failed, Germany would have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them (animals) as they were readily available for milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats are generally kept in herds and roam on hills or other grasslands, usually supervised by children, adolescents, or shepherds with limited knowledge. These grazing practices are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England at the beginning of the 16th century.
Even though the wagonways were made only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the use of horses to gain better speed and haul heavier loads on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Crossties were introduced very early on to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually understood that they would be more efficient if the tracks had an iron layer.
This became the common method, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the carriages to wear out more quickly.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, fully iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known mode of transportation, with humans beginning to stand upright and walk around two hundred thousand years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not always walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, however, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs around 7 million years ago.
We can start living more harmoniously with nature, participate in natural movements, and become activists to alleviate the suffering of future generations to some extent.
In many cases, this is similar to treating the symptoms. However, if we don't want just a temporary fix, we need to find the root causes of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clear that advancements in science and technology have greatly changed the world, and problems have taken on a larger form due to the increased population and humanity's unrestrained lifestyle.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were created, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
On July 8th, John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document on the grounds of Independence Hall.
One person was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had this read by his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
There are 25 known surviving copies of the Dunlap broadside, which are the oldest known existing copies. The original manuscript copy does not survive.
Today, many archaeologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things found in the case of birds still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet with claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind two legs like a T-Rex.
All computers currently in use are based on utilizing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
In a binary number, there can be only 1 value out of 2 values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, for use in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are too common to immediately diagnose the cause.
An open container of medicine or household poisonous chemicals can be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bug" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This word comes from an ancient association with bedbugs, insects that are extremely dependent on humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in nests or the dwellings of their hosts.
Throughout the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child.
These couples may decide to make a plan to adopt a child for themselves.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides the majority of scientific research.
This is not discrete; however, experimentation and an experiment are a test used to rule out the possibility of 1 or more potential hypotheses. Asking questions and recording observations also provide direction to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical literature, and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all subjects in science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge faded, the West realized that it had become disconnected from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are decisively dependent on internal cycles and their generation by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms have been documented for many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, not just responding to external periodic cues.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain free-running cycling periods even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
In those two experiments, they marked either the DNA within the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of a mutation can vary widely depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic element it occurred in, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Changes can only be induced in new cells in children, whereas mutations elsewhere can lead to cell destruction or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying natural scenery, including flora, fauna, and wildlife.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Visiting Borneo, taking photos, and learning about orangutans is one example of that.
Every morning, people leave their small native villages to go to their workplaces and are passed by other people whose work destination is the very place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supporting a personal car-based transportation system.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has altered the biosphere's stable state, which had supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, we rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses to the same extent.
Why does the transportation system encourage such complaints, and why does it fail daily? Are only transport engineers inefficient? Or is something more fundamentally flawed in the planning?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to be reasonably consistent; therefore, there is a moderate degree of continuity in traffic flow, and it can generally be modeled mathematically.
To best represent traffic flow, the relationship between the following 3 main characteristics has been established: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings close to their body.
This gives it a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and mayflies are insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others felt the opposite; that the solar system, along with the sun (and other stars as well), revolves around the Earth.
This seems logical, as we don't feel the Earth rotating, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than 8 times the water volume of the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to 6 miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the old kingdoms, but no one could surpass the size of the Giza pyramids and the superior technical quality of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom focused on the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent country and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legal matters and official communications.
Italian is an everyday language used by the majority of people working in the state, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in their native form in nature and are relatively easy to extract from mines using ancient tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is composed of more than 1 or 4 elements. Those elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
This is quite similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, however, they also theorized that these transform into new substances to create what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like Calcium and Potassium are considered metals. Of course, metals also include things like Silver and Gold.
You may also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of a specific type of matter. All specific types of matter are made up of extremely small particles called atoms.
Atoms are extremely small, so small that billions of them can fit into a tiny volume.
Therefore, when the pencil arrived, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the rise of newer methods of writing, the importance and use of pencils gradually diminished.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to use a sharpener.
Someone might also wonder how a new word would be typed on a keyboard if it came into being.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to hold together a nucleus containing many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy vehicle uphill. When the nucleus divides again, some energy is released.
The nucleus of some atoms is unstable, meaning they are likely to break apart with a slight disturbance or even spontaneously.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thin near Maria and thick in the raised areas.
Because the upper crust is thin, there may be more maria in the nearby regions. It is easier for lava to well up to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates people to make certain choices or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories are to observe, in the case of such people, exactly what things people do that they want to do, and what things in their environment allow them to do those things, and what things do not allow them to do them.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, when managers start managing their former colleagues, two types of behaviors can emerge. People on one end of the spectrum try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels that they should change everything the organization has been doing and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often creates a divide between the hero and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate, real-world team.
They have more autonomy than members of traditional teams, a concept that their local management may not understand, perhaps because their team can meet across different time zones.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"The 'Invisible Team' is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an institution want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a research institution? One goal of putting the concepts of institutional learning into practice is innovation.
Artistry and ingenuity are evident when all available resources are used effectively across all operational departments of the organization.
Consequently, the organization's process of working together to remove obstacles can become a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, its leaders must cultivate a culture of innovation, as well as facilitate knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angle (2006) provides information regarding institutions using the Continuum Approach as a method for achieving peak performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches in cognitive investigations, thereby narrowing the scope of discovery and making it more precise.
Brain pathology and its relation to behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain injuries, traumas, wounds, and tumors affect behavior and also alter certain mental functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and closely examine brain structures and processes in ways never before possible.
This provides a lot of information and material to create a simulation model that will help you understand the processes in your mind.
Although AI may have originated as a scientifically imaginative concept, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior of machines, the act of learning, and the process of adaptation.
AI research involves creating machines that automate activities that typically require human intelligence.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, customer diagnosis and question answering capabilities, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now extensively used in many fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Visiting places in person is a very big part of classroom education. Often the teacher needs to take her students to places where there is no bus option available.
Technology has provided a solution for virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art from the comfort of their classroom.
Virtually managing a field trip's logistics is also a cool way to discuss the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in Northern California create a website about their field trip to the state's capital, and while the website is recreated each year, its older versions are kept online like a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often make grammatical and spelling errors in blogs, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Now that students are the most discerning critics, the blog writer strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also makes students more aware of the world around them." The need to cater to the audience's interests motivates children to become smarter and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
"The appropriate use of blogs helps children become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can determine their own position in relation to the writing of others and, at the same time, develop their own perspective on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's very attractive, bilingual capital and is home to many distinctive art exhibitions and museums that tell the story of Canada's past and present.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north lies Muskoka and beyond, home to unexplored natural beauty.
All these things and more highlight Ontario, which is considered by outsiders to be the best of Canada.
Further north, the population is very sparse, and some of it is part of a desolate forest.
Something that surprises many when comparing populations: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
These East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Considering wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and practically a continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known for luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to this land, and its spread greatly increased in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route to India from Europe.
In the north, this ward is surrounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: Any woman who is traveling is advised to represent herself as married, regardless of her actual marital status.
Wearing a ring (not just one that looks expensive, but any ring) can also be beneficial.
Women need to understand that what they perceive as harassment may be due to cultural differences, and things like pursuing someone or holding their hand are not uncommon.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether or not there are cultural differences, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it after an earthquake in 1755, only to abandon it, and rebuilt it as Casa Branca.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Beida, and the Spanish merchants who had established their trading post there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines (North African stew), pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a treasure trove of countless trinkets, but it's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, destroying most of the city's roads, especially in the city center.
While Goma is reasonably secure, any visits outside Goma should be researched to understand the battle situation prevailing in the North Kivu province.
The city serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as being in Africa's one of the most affordable places to trek mountain gorillas.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese Francs.
Due to its remoteness, "Timbuktu" is used as an example of a unique and faraway place.
Today, Timbuktu is a city that has lost its prosperity, yet its reputation continues to attract tourists, and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of sand encroachment in the desert.
This was one of Henry Louis Gates' major stops during the PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
This city is quite different from other cities in the country because the temperament of the people here is more like that of Arabs than Africans.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a flagship symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like other South African national parks, this park also charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
Purchasing a Wild Card can also be beneficial, as it provides access to select parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong has lent its name to the surrounding area, and the place is a major draw for tourists.
The Hong Kong skyline, with its skyscrapers accentuated by the waters of Victoria Harbour, has been likened to a glittering bar chart.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite side of the Kowloon waterfall.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This place was claimed by British colonists as their own, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest, extending approximately 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Indian part of the forest is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps, however - they also contain some of the remaining remnants of the many forests that once covered the Ganges region.
The area of Sundarbans is 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/swamps.
Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
Throughout the day, many buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river), but especially buses heading towards the east and Jakar/Bumthang mostly leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are often fully packed, so it would be wise to buy tickets a few days in advance.
In most districts, these small Japanese coaster buses provide service; they are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable option for visiting nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
2 towers are 83 meters tall, this one is 378 meters tall, and it has 2 corridors with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under this bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group, now residing in eastern Paraguay, who were nomadic hunters and also practiced agriculture for their livelihood.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes like the Gweykuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
As a result of the conflict between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous tribes in the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "Giant Province of the Indies," was born.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonialism that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been successful in preserving its indigenous people and identity.
Argentina is known as one of the best polo teams and home to some of the best players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the Las Canitas polo ground.
At other times of the year, you can also see small competitions and matches here.
Visit Asociación Argentina de Polo for tournament news and to purchase polo match tickets.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at a value of one-to-one.
Money can be exchanged at the FIC West Store to the only bank on the islands located in Stanley.
British Pounds are generally accepted on the islands and in Stanley anywhere that accepts credit cards, and United States Dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards might not be accepted outside the islands, although British and United States currency will be taken; inquire with the owner beforehand about which payment methods are acceptable.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is nearly impossible, so exchange your currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter.
Montevideo is located in the tropics, and during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
There will be deceptive cold in winter: the temperature will rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity together will make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is generally consistent throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals remain wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can be aggressive.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are very large, wild, and dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition to this, be aware of smells that attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing cooked fragrant food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port is the site of a notorious naval incident that occurred in 1889 when 7 ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave its harbor.
Apart from one British cruiser, all other ships sank. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The peaceful assembly in the city, organized by the Mau movement during the struggle for independence, culminated in the assassination of the supreme head, Tapua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to its location between 2 harbors. The most popular beaches are in 3 areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) belong to the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are all sandy beaches and safe for swimming, and most places have shade provided by casuarina trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good string of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number 1', which isn't a mixed beer, but is pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better positioned to travel long distances.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is also easy to find if you have any safety concerns.
The concept of 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. Small black drinks are 'espresso', cappuccino is served with cream (not foamed), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the year, the rock face receives numerous visits, and despite these reasons, injuries to the rock face are rare.
Even so, seek advice from officials, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found north of 17°N along coastlines or in river mouths between October and April. They sometimes appear outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and stay away in the water.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively inhabit the open ocean; their primary habitat ranges from Rockhampton to the northern tributaries.
Pre-booking gives travelers peace of mind knowing that they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
While travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, it is still possible to book other types of accommodation, like camping grounds, through them.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and combined deals for flights and hotels.
If you need time to consider the offer or obtain some other documents (e.g., a visa), you can still reserve it.
Any changes or requests should first be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, people who participate in music festivals on a large scale camp at the venue itself, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, you'll have to come early and pitch your tent near Sangeeta.
Please note that even though the music on the main stage has ended, some parts of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as it can wreak havoc for those highly affected when traveling through ice.
The St. Petersburg cruise allows time to be spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from needing a visa (read the conditions).
Casinos often go to great lengths to encourage guests to spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and finding the exits can be very difficult.
They often have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings to keep guests in good spirits and put them at ease.
Some venues/locations provide alcoholic beverages in-house. However, alcohol consumption impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high-altitude areas or on mountain roads should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-freezing temperatures.
Icy and snowy roads have less friction, and you can't drive here the same way you would on paved roads.
During blizzard conditions, enough snow can fall in a very short time to bury you.
Visibility can also be restricted due to ice forming or being deposited on vehicle windows, or due to condensation.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues throughout the year without any disruptions.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest driver of tourism in Africa and are a major attraction for many visitors.
The word "safari," especially popular in use for seeing fascinating African wildlife on the savanna, refers to overland travel.
Animals like elephants and giraffes can get close to the car, and you can observe them better with the help of standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes hide, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or simply "walking") involves hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some competitions will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the moratorium was announced, then you are in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but currently coronavirus-related cancellation policies are not extended beyond July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that tickets for many events will be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry faster. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for rent, even when there is no one in the room.
If an iron is not available or you don't find it convenient to use, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Make sure the cloth doesn't get too hot (otherwise it will shrink, or worse, burn).
There are various options for purifying water, and some options are more effective against specific germs.
Boiling water for one minute may be sufficient in some areas, while a few minutes may be necessary in others.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may see insects not found in their regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people using force, are not usually recognized as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods without certain taxes and excise duties at specific locations.
Travelers can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco, in countries with high tax rates.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont, with its isolated wilderness frequently traversed by the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, creates challenging conditions.
If you are not used to driving on roads in this country, please be clear about things like steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp winding paths.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and it's more important to adhere to them strictly than at other times.
If I were to excitedly say, the mobile phone service is much stronger compared to other parts of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.

If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they will be dragged if the horse starts to run. To reduce this risk, many safety precautions have been taken.
Previously, many riders wore riding boots with heels and flat, fairly narrow soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if the rider falls and their weight pulls the stirrup leather backwards.
