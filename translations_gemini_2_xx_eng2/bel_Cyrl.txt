Despite the fact that one of the vaccines, which is in the experimental stage, may prove capable of reducing the mortality rate from Ebola, no drug has yet definitively demonstrated its suitability for treating an existing infection.
Initially, one of the antibody cocktails, ZMapp, appeared promising in this area, but official studies demonstrated less benefit than was necessary to prevent death.
During the PALM clinical trials, the drug ZMapp was used as a control. This means it was used as a benchmark, with the three other drugs being compared to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the US Olympic Committee's letter and agrees that the Olympic family must create safe conditions for all athletes as a matter of urgency.
We agree with the statement of the United States Olympic Committee that if important changes occur within our organization, it will be in the interests of the athletes and clubs, as well as the sports they represent. Revocation of the license in this case is not the best solution.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation because it can shed light on how abuse on such a scale, fearlessly described by the students of Larry Nassar who went through it, could remain unnoticed for so long. It also addresses the necessary changes.
The Gymnastics Committee and the U.S. Olympic Committee are united by one goal — to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes, so that they can turn their dreams into reality in a safe, positive environment with many opportunities.

This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides information that is not usually obtainable by studying fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the feathers.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top and had a pale or reddish-yellow hue on the underside.
This discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft (rachis) but possess other feather characteristics—barbules and barbs—researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development compared to other characteristics.
Judging by the structure of the feathers, one can conclude that they were used not for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or attract attention. Researchers suggested that even though it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample might show adult plumage rather than downy feathers of a chick.
Researchers suggest that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen may show the plumage of an adult animal, rather than the down of a chick.

The terms "luminosity" and "rotation" are used in combination to determine the Rossby number of a particular star. The latter is related to plasma flow.
The star's activity with respect to magnetic field reversal is less, the smaller the Rossby number.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in the KwaZulu-Natal region of the Republic of South Africa.
He once stated in an interview that the new variant "causes significant concern and anxiety because it has a very high mortality rate."

The voting process in France has traditionally not been high-tech. Voters would go into a booth to retrieve a pre-printed paper slip with the name of their chosen candidate and place it in an envelope.
After being identified by officials, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
This entire procedure is carried out in strict accordance with French electoral law.
Starting in 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent. This is done so that voters and observers have the opportunity to confirm that there were no envelopes in the boxes at the start of voting and that no other envelopes (other than those properly authorized and counted voters placed in the ballot boxes) were deposited there.
To witness every part of the process, candidates can send their representatives. In the evening, following specific procedures, volunteers, who are under strict supervision, count the votes.

One explosive device detonated near the office of the Governor-General.
Another three bombs exploded near government buildings within two hours.
According to some reports, eight people died. Official reports mention an estimated 30 injured. However, the final figures are not yet known.
Cyanuric acid and melamine were found in urine samples of pets that died after consuming contaminated food.
Researchers from the university stated that these two compounds react with each other and form crystals that can block kidney function.
When melanin and cyanuric acid were added to cat urine, the researchers observed the formation of crystals.
According to the results of infrared spectroscopic analysis, the structure and composition of these crystals are analogous to the structure and composition of those found in the urine of affected animals.
I don't know if this is clear to you or not, but the majority of goods that are delivered to this country from Central America are not subject to duties.
At the same time, eighty percent of our goods in Central America were taxed.
It seemed pointless to me and, of course, unfair.
I always tell people - you treat us the same way we treat you.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Governor of California, approved a bill that prohibits selling or renting video games with excessive violence to minors.
According to the bill, all violent video games sold in the state of California must have an "18" label, and their sale to minors is punishable by a fine of $1,000 per violation.
Keir Starmer, a King's Counsel and former Director of Public Prosecutions, made a statement this morning announcing the prosecution of Huné and Price.
Hune has resigned. Member of Parliament Ed Davey will be appointed to his position in the Cabinet. Davey's position as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is expected to be taken by Member of Parliament Norman Lamb.
Price and Heun are scheduled to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cadebec, 21, died in the accident. Cadebec was driving.
Christopher Schneider will need plastic surgery on his face, and Edgar Vegila was wounded in the jaw and arm.
When Uka pointed the gun at the fifth soldier's head, it didn't fire. Schneider now suffers from constant pain, and one of his eyes doesn't see. He's missing a piece of his skull, and his face is now partially made of titanium.
Schneider testified from his home country via video link, while he was at a US Navy base.
Besides the competitions on Wednesday, Carpaneda participated in two more individual races at the championship.
Initially, she participated in slalom, where she was disqualified in the first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result.
During the giant slalom event, she finished tenth among women in the sitting position. Her total time was 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes behind first place, which was taken by Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth place, taken by Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers from the group of athletes with disabilities did not reach the finish line, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers failed to qualify for the giant slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were returned to their owner by the Madhya Pradesh police.
"We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss tourist, and we were able to recover her mobile phone and laptop," said D.K. Arya, Deputy Inspector General.
Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar are the names of those who are being named as the accused.
The accused appeared in court with their faces covered, according to Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Despite the fact that there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver sustained severe head injuries.
While emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT, traffic was temporarily blocked on the road where the accident occurred.
Initially, he was placed in James Paget Hospital, located in Great Yarmouth.
He was eventually transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekojo has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, as she is accused of murdering her son.
She awaits indictment and trial while in custody. However, given that her photographs have been widely published, any eyewitness testimony may be called into question.
In other regions of Great Britain, this is a widespread practice, however, in Scotland, justice works differently — the courts believe that publishing photographs could potentially be harmful.
"It seems journalists are treading a dangerous path when they publish photos, etc., of suspects," notes Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Office of the High Court, authorized to bring criminal charges, informed journalists that, at least until an indictment is filed, no further comments will be available.
According to the information received, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in a way that preserves the borders that existed before the start of the 1967 Middle East war.
According to the information received, among other topics covered by the document are the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands that a military presence be maintained in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while Palestine agrees to only five years.
Shooters participating in the supplemental animal control program were to be closely supervised by rangers because the program was being monitored and its effectiveness was being assessed.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia, Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers to participate in a culling program being implemented under the auspices of the Sporting Shooters' Association.
Mick Flynn, who is temporarily acting as director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service for park protection and heritage, stated that the four shooters selected to conduct the first shooting operation were given comprehensive safety instructions and underwent appropriate training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council, composed of nine members.
This is already Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the early dissolution of the Provisional Electoral Council as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
Martelly responded to the large anti-government protests that began in October with a commission.
The reason for the protests, which were sometimes turbulent and fierce, was the absence of elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
Around 60 cases of defective iPods overheating were registered. This led to six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
According to a statement from Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), they had information on the 27 accidents that occurred as a result of using the devices.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it had received a report from Apple about 34 new overheating incidents, which Apple had classified as "minor."
In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report to a later date "worthy of sincere regret."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 Friday GMT).
Representatives of the Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Office stated that there were no reports of damage or accidents in the country.
Furthermore, according to data from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of the disaster.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus in the Philippine capital Manila and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with his M16.
Several hostages were rescued, and at this time, according to confirmed data, at least six were killed.
Six hostages, including elderly people and children, as well as photographers from the Philippines, were released ahead of schedule.
The elderly woman needed to use the restroom, so the photographers were held hostage in her place. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's example and became a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
When Liggins worked in the hospital, he began to study the problem of premature births in his free time.
According to his research, the introduction of the hormone accelerates the maturation of the embryo's lungs.
According to the Xinhua news agency, government investigators on Wednesday found two so-called "black boxes" - flight data recorders.
Luna's memory was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. She passed away on the night of two moons. It's quite original, just like she was. Luna was a strong woman," said Tony Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels remarked: "Luna was quite the oddball, no less than me... maybe even more... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I want to believe she's in a better place now."
The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a survey of 1400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, the acting Prime Minister, stated that, in her opinion, at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
34 percent of the survey participants share this opinion. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of respondents, who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent, who, on the contrary, believe that this should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and participate in three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition is doubtful: he has complained quite a bit about his health.
He wasn't allowed to take painkillers because they are banned at the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
This discovery was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is believed that comets could have brought to Earth not only organic substances that can form proteins and serve as a source of life support, but also water.
Given that comets collided with Earth in the distant past, scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, primarily that of Earth.
Earlier this year, 53-year-old Cuomo was elected governor. He signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He christened these rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration states that thanks to the NextGen system, airplanes will be able to fly shorter routes, which will help save millions of liters of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
Unlike older ground-based radar systems, it uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to determine the location of aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
The amount of transport is not increasing, and overground trains will not stop at "Wembley"; furthermore, there is no parking for cars at ground level, nor is there a park-and-ride facility.
The likelihood of having to hold the game behind closed doors without fans increased, as there may not be enough transport available.
The formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands is written about in a study published Thursday in the journal "Science."
According to a report by researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of a new species occurred in just two generations, although it was previously believed that this process required much more time. The emergence of the new species was made possible by the hybridization of the endemic medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) with the non-native large cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
From gold, one can cast various shapes. It can be rolled into thin sheets.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can then be easily twisted and braided. It can also be hammered out or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate painted illustrations in books—so-called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH level of a particular chemical substance. You can make such an acid-base indicator yourself from red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity level of a particular substance.
The pH level in the investigated chemical is determined based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the "H" in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as is known, a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix these two dry powders in a circular motion until they combine into a single whole, and then use wet hands to form them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation. In the process, a kind of shell is formed.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Greek cities on Crete and Santorini, dating back to the Minoan period.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths, in which women and men were together.
You're using a satellite when you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away.
In space, a satellite receives a call, and then almost instantly reflects it back.
The rocket was used to send a satellite into space. Scientists have to use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere refracts light, distorting the image.
In order for a telescope or satellite to reach space, an enormous rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. Easier and faster movement is the greatest thing the wheel has done for us.
Thanks to him, we have trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Below are mid-sized cats. Their prey is also mid-sized—they hunt both rabbits and antelope and deer.
In addition to everything, many small cats (including free-ranging pets) catch and eat more numerous small prey — insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the fact that each occupies its own niche, i.e., has a function unique to it, and therefore doesn't need to compete with other cats.
Lions are among the most social cats: they live in large groups known as prides.
A pride can include up to three adult males, who are related, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
In most cases, the females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides and wolf or dog packs is similar in many ways. The latter can strongly resemble lions in their behavior (but not other big cats) in that they pose a deadly threat to prey.
A tiger is able to climb (though not very well), jump great distances, swim, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man, like a well-trained athlete.
The tiger belongs to the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera). No other felines besides these four can roar.
A tiger's roar is more like a sentence composed of sharp and loud words than a lion's full-throated roar.
Ocelots prey on small animals. When possible, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds. Almost all the animals it hunts are significantly smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that ocelots stalk and find prey by scent, sniffing tracks on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they see well in the dark and move very confidently. Ocelots hunt by blending in with their surroundings and attacking their prey from ambush.
When a small group of living things (a small population) breaks away from the main population from which they originate (say, when moving across a river or mountain range, or when such living things migrate to a new island, making it quite difficult for them to return), they often find themselves in an environment that is significantly different from where they came from.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so in order to become a strong competitor itself, the new population will need different traits or adaptations compared to those it had before.
The original population hasn't changed at all: as before, they still need to adapt.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the animals increasingly resemble the main population from which they separated less and less.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass, and sooner or later, the two mentioned populations will look so different that no one would even think to classify them as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which in effect means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe. In addition to that, they use carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants "cook" their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from them. We eat mostly plants. And animals wouldn't survive without plants either.
For their time, mosasaurs were apex predators, so they feared nothing and no one except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws boasted over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and there was an additional row in the upper part of his mouth. This meant that his prey would have no chance of escaping.
It is not known for certain, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. The diet of mosasaurs consisted of large fish, turtles, and other mosasaurs. It is likely that they may also have consumed members of their own species.
Besides that, he would pounce on anything that fell into the water; his retrieve was not worthy even of such a giant as a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Although their food wouldn't generally surprise us, some dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them were boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent known as the edible dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy held banquets where they ate and reclined at the same time.
The dishes prepared in Ancient Rome could not include ingredients that arrived in Europe from America or Asia later.
They didn't have, in particular, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, or cocoa. It should also be added that no ancient Roman ever had the opportunity to taste turkey.
For each of their gods, the inhabitants of Babylon built a main temple, which was considered his home.
Believers brought sacrifices to their deities, and priests tried to satisfy their needs by holding various holidays and ceremonies in their honor.
Each temple had its own open courtyard and sanctuary, which only priests could visit.
In some instances, during the construction of temples, special towers resembling pyramids were erected. These were known as ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of great importance.
For the most part, the life of a Jewish family took place outdoors.
Women were cooking outdoors; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
In Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was of great value.
Greenland was not densely populated. According to Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and, sailing west, he came across Greenland, which he named "Greenland" ("Green Land").
But regardless of his discovery, tribes of Eskimos already lived there at that time.
There were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, despite each of these countries being "Scandinavian."
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this does not correspond to reality. Despite the fact that something is indeed written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, was written: "Original Draft of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776." The inverted inscription is located at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, no one knows for sure, but it is known that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was rolled up for preservation at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it may well be that this entry was added there simply as a note.
Thanks to the Normandy landings and subsequent battles, it was possible to liberate northern France, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
He was under the authority of the "Vichyites." These were those French who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon began – the Allies landed in southern France.
Americans and the forces of "Free France" liberated the southern territories of France in just two weeks, after which they headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people who work together and live in a society.
The aforementioned term "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, i.e., "civil." The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, that is, "citizen," as well as to the noun civitas, or "city" or "city-state." All of this, in turn, somehow speaks to the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, equitable distribution, and a lasting cultural footprint.
Often, small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word because they disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation. This government consisted only of the Congress.
The Congress did not have the authority to introduce taxes, and since a national executive and judicial branch did not exist, it relied on the support of state authorities to enforce all laws, which were often not inclined to cooperate.
Furthermore, he lacked the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs introduced by the states.
According to the Articles of Confederation, unanimous consent of all states was required to make amendments, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, just like the Germany national team, ranks second among the strongest national teams in the world. In 2006, it won the FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing are among the popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, although Italians also participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is located on almost 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu. Thanks to this, Japan ranks 7th in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often called an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view, as it is a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan began as early as the 15th century. It was then that its name was recorded by European sailors passing by as "Formosa," which meant "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of primitive farming practices. The company hired Chinese laborers to cultivate rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) captured the western and northern Taiwanese territories in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, according to which the right of sovereignty over the island was transferred to Japan, and the latter controlled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
To give tourists a better idea of what most of the buildings on the edges of the complex originally looked like, the latter were rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
Yes, the most popular format in the world for still-image photographs is the 35mm format. At the end of the era of analog photography, this film format predominated.
Such film is still being produced, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio is now used in the sensor formats of digital cameras.
It can be a little confusing, but in reality, the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Accordingly, it is considered that the aspect ratio for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler whole-number proportion) is 3:2.
Many common formats have the same or similar aspect ratios (for example, the APS format family).
The rule of thirds, often attacked and mocked, provides simple advice that ensures dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in an image.
If you believe him, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the photograph into thirds in the vertical and horizontal planes (see example).
During this period of European history, the activities of the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
Despite all the linguistic and cultural differences that existed, the Christian religion united European countries for over a thousand years.
Everyone, from the king to the commoner, was under her all-pervasive power.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity lies in the idea that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and alleviate suffering, and that this is precisely what the church's funds are for.
For over a thousand years, the central church authorities have been located in Rome. Because of this concentration of power and money, many question whether this dogma is being followed.
Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of hostilities.
The embargo on the supply of vital military and civilian goods, although it violated generally recognized international law, which had been enshrined in legislation over the past two centuries by several international agreements, proved to be an effective strategy.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering certain areas of the ocean, thereby endangering even neutral vessels.
Because there was no significant reaction to this tactic, Germany believed that there would be no reaction to unrestricted submarine warfare either.
Pacifist and isolationist sentiments prevailed among most citizens and countries throughout the 1920s.
States and nations intended to avoid such a situation in the future, as they had already witnessed the horrors and atrocities during the First World War.
In 1884, Tesla moved to live in the United States of America because he got a job at the "Edison" company, which is located in New York.
He had only 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) in his pocket when he arrived in the USA.
In ancient China, there were unique ways to denote different epochs. At each stage of China's history, or within each family in power, distinct dynasties existed.
Furthermore, the reigns of dynasties were separated by periods of disunited provinces, when instability reigned. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, many nobles vying for the throne waged ruthless battles among themselves.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms era: thousands of people died during the struggle for the opportunity to occupy the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them were the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the rise of nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs not to a single ruler, but to the entire people.
Moreover, various positions after the Revolution became available to all male candidates, resulting in the most successful and ambitious rising to the top.
The same thing happened in the army, because if previously military ranks were assigned based on social class, now they were based on skills and abilities.
Moreover, the French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond worldly life. To meditate and reflect, he often visited a cave on Mount Nur (which translates as "light"), known as "Hira".
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, provides a very vivid impression of the spiritual foundations of Muhammad.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world - it is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In reality, she is very difficult to find, even if someone knows about her existence. Inside the cave, you are in complete isolation.
Besides the edge of the clear beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains, you won't see anything. From the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramids that were erected to honor the memory of the deceased pharaoh. It was built in the third century BC.
On the Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, are located several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were for the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The sign indicating an up-bow is a "V", and the one for down-bow is a curved line or a square without the bottom side.
"Up-bow" means that you need to start the movement from the tip of the bow and draw it upwards, while "down-bow" means that you need to start from the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow downwards.
An up-bow stroke usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow stroke produces a stronger and more confident sound.
You can make your marks with a pencil, but don't forget that the printed symbols of the tie are there for a reason, for a specific musical purpose, so they usually need to be preserved.
On October 6, 1789, due to a crowd of women from the market, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Marie Therese), as well as Madame Elisabeth, the King's sister, had to return from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family was taken to Paris in a carriage. On the way, they were surrounded by a crowd — people in it whistled, shouted, and yelled threats at the king and queen.
The king and queen had to open the carriage windows under pressure from the crowd.
At one point, someone from the crowd waved the head of a guard killed at Versailles in front of the queen, who was already scared to death.
The military expenses of the US imperialists, incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines, had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay off a significant portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were placed through Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the US imperialists would be the super-profits brought by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To imagine who the Templars were, one needs to have a good understanding of what the prerequisites for the creation of the order were.
Traditionally, the era in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages—a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
First came the Early Middle Ages, followed by the High Middle Ages, and after that, the Late Middle Ages. The latter, as is commonly believed, ended around 1500 AD.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses a range of practical ideas, from pressure to promote specific technologies or technical necessity to the precise understanding that human destiny is determined by the logic underlying scientific laws and their embodiment in the realm of technology.
Two general ideas are characteristic of most explanations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself largely occurs outside of cultural or political influence, and technologies, in turn, have an inherent (rather than socially conditioned) influence on society.
In particular, there is an opinion that the use of cars stimulates road development.
Nevertheless, if the number of cars is small, a nationwide road network does not make economic sense. For this reason, new production methods are being developed that will reduce the cost of car ownership.
Due to the large number of car owners, the number of traffic accidents is increasing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of healthcare that allow treating various injuries.
A huge element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
Speaking of the Romantic era, the geography of presence had a strong influence on people. Over time, traditions and culture arose, connected to it. They were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, because they existed in harmony with the place and the position occupied by society.
While Paris is considered the modern capital of fashion, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 AD, the city gains prominence as an epicenter of luxury and retains this status until almost 1100 AD.
Throughout the 12th century, its status as a capital of luxury faded. This happened mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts, including spices and silk, which were valued much higher than what was offered in the markets of Byzantium.
It was then that Constantinople conceded the title of fashion capital to Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as the 14th century.
Initially, the Eastern Byzantine culture had a strong influence on clothing style.
However, Western styles can lag behind by 25–30 years due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people started using buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades was one of the most significant events of that time.
In a subsistence agricultural system, the amount of food produced is only enough to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Natural farming is a simple and, as a rule, organic system. It is based on using preserved seeds specific to a particular ecological region, in combination with crop rotation or other very simple methods. The goal of all this is to achieve maximum yield.
Historically, many farmers practiced subsistence agriculture. Currently, many third-world countries still practice it.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views who, from the perspective of social norms, feel neglected and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of representatives can be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a distinct subculture can occur based on various factors — linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination thereof.
Members of the same subculture often define their belonging to it through a distinctive and symbolic style in clothing, manner of behavior, and jargon.
As an illustration of what socialization is and how important it is, the example most often cited is that of children who were unfortunate enough to grow up in an atmosphere of disdain, neglect, various hardships or humiliation and insult, and who were not socialized by adults in childhood.
Such children are called "feral." Some "feral" children have been held in captivity for extended periods (usually they were treated this way by their own parents); in some cases, the lack of parental care was the result of parents' unwillingness to notice serious physical or intellectual impairments and deficiencies in the child.
Before they were abandoned or ran away, feral children may have suffered severe abuse or experienced trauma.
Others, it seemed, were raised by animals; according to rumors, some lived independently in the wild.
If a child is raised entirely by animals, their behavior almost entirely (considering physical limitations) reflects the behavior of the animal caretaker: for example, such a child may be afraid of or indifferent to people.
While the goal of project-based learning is to make the learning process easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes even further in this regard.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather an assistant that helps people gain new experiences in learning. This can mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, both a teacher and the little paperclip in Microsoft Office are assistants.
The software includes virtual assistants. They are needed to ask questions, provide hints, and explain procedures that a student or listener finds difficult to understand on their own.
There are many reasons why children may end up in foster care. These can include abuse, neglect, and even coercion.
It is unacceptable for children to grow up in an environment where no one cares for them, they are not raised, and their education is neglected, yet this still happens.
In our opinion, the foster care system is a safe zone for such children.
It is expected that thanks to our foster care system, wards will have reliable medical care, safe homes, kind and caring guardians, and a stable education.
It is considered that a foster family must provide for all the child's needs that were not met in the home from which they were taken.
The internet is a means not only of mass communication, but also of interpersonal communication.
Due to the special characteristics of the Internet, additional opportunities arise for its use and for satisfying the needs of the audience.
For example, the opinion is expressed that concepts such as "education" and "socialization" are significant motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when researching audience response to websites.
Thanks to video recording, important discoveries were made in the interpretation of microexpressions—meaning facial muscle movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, among other things, that the correct interpretation of microexpressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks noted how people with brain damage, without understanding the speech itself, can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that animals—for example, domestic dogs—may also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
The research results of the twentieth century indicate that there are two pools of genetic variability, namely, manifest and hidden variations.
Under the influence of mutation, new genetic variations arise, and with the help of selection, they are removed from the pool of expressed traits.
With each subsequent generation, segregation and recombination shuffle the variations within these two pools.
In the savanna, available plant resources cannot satisfy the primates' need for amino acids if their digestive system is similar to humans'.
Moreover, if they fail to do so, the consequences are serious. These include malnutrition, growth depression, and inevitable death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been proteins, found in legumes and foliage. However, if not prepared properly, they are difficult for organisms of primates like us to digest.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large amount of protein, rich in all the necessary amino acids and, at the same time, easily digestible.
Judging by all appearances, it should come as no surprise if it turns out that our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in almost the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption refers to the deliberate waking of a sleeping person during the normal sleep process and falling back asleep again after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up, but not completely.
If you find yourself snoozing the alarm clock in your sleep, try placing it on the other side of the room. That way, you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other versions based on biorhythms, it is necessary to consume a lot of fluids (primarily water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed - this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the tension in their body and spirit.
The more vital force is present, the more positive it is, the lower the tension. Absolute peace and contentment are available to everyone.
Enlightenment can be attained by anyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
At the heart of Tibetan Buddhism lies the teachings of Buddha, which were supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and a range of methods from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini yoga, and love for all humanity.
Followers of Kundalini yoga claim that in order to awaken Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment), one needs to practice specific yoga poses, mantras, and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a key part of Tibetan meditation practice. Visualizing various deities allows one to purify energy channels, open chakras, and achieve enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led the USSR and the USA to cooperate. After the end of the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to quarrels between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins - former allies turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it truly involved the armies of friendly countries fighting. The battlefields were located in various regions—from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense was broken by September 17, 1939. Retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
Nevertheless, in just one night, these plans became meaningless, as over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army, part of the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts, entered the territory of eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Shipping cargo by boat is clearly the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of naval forces was defined as ensuring their country was able to transport people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from transporting their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II became one of the most significant examples of this idea. With the aim of helping Great Britain, the Americans endeavored to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the aforementioned movement, mainly using submarines for this purpose.
Germany could probably have conquered Great Britain in the same way it conquered the rest of Europe if the Allies had failed.
It appears that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them in order to always have milk, wool, meat, and hides on hand.
Typically, domestic goats grazed in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures. Often they were tended by goatherds—children or teenagers. The latter acted as shepherds. Animals are still herded this way today.
As early as the 16th century, haul roads were built in England.
Although corduroy roads were just parallel wooden planks, they allowed draft horses to move faster and pull heavier loads than on the existing uneven roads.
Sleepers began to be used to hold the rails in place quite early. However, after some time, it became clear that movement on the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, however, due to the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the wagons wore out faster.
After some time, iron wheels replaced wooden ones. The first rails made entirely of metal appeared in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man"), people began to walk in an upright posture.
Australopithecines, their predecessors, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedal individuals of australopithecines have been found in fossils dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, however, it is entirely possible that seven million years ago, Sahelanthropus was already walking on two legs.
One can become more aware of the environment, one can become a participant in the environmental movement, one can even become an activist, so that in the future the aforementioned suffering does not turn out to be very strong.
Often, this looks more like symptomatic treatment. However, if we need more than just a temporary solution, then we must find and destroy the root of the problems.
It is quite obvious that thanks to the technical and scientific achievements of humanity, the world has changed significantly. As a result of overpopulation and people's wasteful lifestyles, the number of problems has increased.
After the Declaration was adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten copy, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to the printing shop of John Dunlap, which was located a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
On July 8, John Nixon publicly read this document for the first time in the yard of Independence Hall.
On July 6th, George Washington received a copy, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9th. On August 10th, another copy reached London.
To our time, 25 of the first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence have survived (known as Dunlap broadsides). The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and that it still exists today, only we call them birds.
Because of feathers and the ability to fly, many people don't consider them dinosaurs.
But birds still share many features with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, lay eggs, and, like Tyrannosaurus Rex, walk on two hind legs.
Virtually all modern computers perform operations on information encoded as binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only consist of one of two values — 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious signs. For example, vomiting is a fairly common symptom, making it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
An open container of pills or toxic household chemicals may be the first sign of internal poisoning.
Instructions for providing emergency medical assistance for this specific poison should be found on the label.
To refer to this group of insects, entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense.
This term arose because people have long known what bedbugs are – these insects that are extremely well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both kissing bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous parasites, meaning they have adapted to living in the nests or homes of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are registered in the United States of America. Accordingly, this neurological disease is a leading one among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a baby does not align with their interests or the interests of the child they already have.
Such couples may give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the child's biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that other spouses can raise and nurture them.
The main goal of science is to determine, through the scientific method, how the world functions. In fact, the majority of scientific research is conducted using this method.
However, he is not the only one. Experimentation (that is, a test conducted to rule out one or more possible hypotheses through questions and observations) also guides and stimulates scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists paid the most attention to classical texts. Primarily, this includes the Bible in Latin.
Commonly accepted views at that time considered Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including in the field of psychology.
When the number of people who knew Greek diminished, the West found itself cut off from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorhythms observed in animal behavior and physiology are largely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles. The latter arise as a result of the functioning of a biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not a direct reaction to external periodic signals, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is an autonomous process. Even when external signals are absent, this process continues in the form of independent, free-running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses claiming that DNA is the genetic material was tested during the Hershey–Chase experiment.
For implanting their own DNA into bacteria, Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the DNA of a bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of a bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of genetic material in which the mutation occurred, and whether the cells affected by it are germline cells, mutations can have very different consequences.
Only mutations in germ cells can be hereditary. Other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts those people who are interested in visiting various natural zones and territories, because they want to enjoy the general view and landscape, including enjoying observations of flora and fauna.
As an example of activities you can do in nature, you could mention fishing, hunting, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
As an example, one could cite visiting, studying, and photographing orangutans on the island of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small provincial towns in their cars to go to work. On the way, they pass other people who work where they just left.
In this dynamic transport cycle, everyone is involved in and supports the car-based transportation system in one way or another.
Scientific data indicates that the modern high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has largely contributed to human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone who participates in the life of society uses transportation systems. And almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you are unlikely to hear so many complaints about collapsing bridges or water quality.
Why are transport systems a constant source of such complaints, why do they regularly fail? Is the reason due to insufficiently competent transport engineers? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The concept of "traffic flow" implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows presents a complex problem because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Drivers, fortunately, usually behave quite consistently; therefore, as a rule, traffic flows are characterized by a certain rationally determined sequence and can be approximately described using mathematical models.
To more fully and effectively illustrate the nature of traffic flow, the relationship between its three main parameters was established: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The existence of these connections helps to plan and design road facilities, as well as manage their operation.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them more effectively avoid enemies, as well as find partners and food.
In most cases, insect wings fold along the body.
Thanks to this, they can squeeze into various very small places to hide there from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects today that cannot fold their wings.
A man named Aristarchus claimed several thousand years ago that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, however, many held a different opinion—that the Solar System (including the Sun and other stars) revolved around the Earth.
Sounds reasonable, because when you're on Earth, it's hard to argue that it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and the largest in terms of water volume, containing 8 times more water than the river in second place.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching a width of six miles.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers.
The Amazon River, into which the waters of thousands of smaller rivers flow, has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles).
Although pyramid construction using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, no one has ever been able to surpass the pyramids of Giza in size and technical perfection.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were in awe of the monuments erected by their ancestors, which at that time were over a thousand years old.
Only about 800 people live in the Vatican. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
Italian is used in the legislation and official communications of the Vatican.
Most of those who work in the public sector use Italian as their daily language, while Latin is often used in religious rites.
All residents of the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Thanks to the fact that basic chemical elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) occur in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools, people knew about them in ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that stated that all things are composed of a single element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
Rather, it looked like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although, according to his theory, they can transform into other substances in order to eventually become what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements similar to calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Furthermore, there are alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic components. Such a non-metallic component could be, for example, carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the significance of the pencil and the frequency of its use have decreased with the emergence of new writing methods.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, and pencil sharpeners are no longer needed.
We can only guess what fate awaits the keyboard when something fundamentally new replaces it.
The principle of a plutonium bomb lies in using the energy of nuclear fusion, when a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
It's like pushing a very heavy cart uphill. Repeated fission of the nucleus will release some of this energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable. This means that they tend to decay under slight external influence or even without it.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust's thickness on the near side is about 70 km, while on the far side it's about 100 km.
Under the lunar maria, the Moon's crust is thinner, while under the highlands, it is thicker.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side of the moon because the crust is thinner here, and therefore it was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Substantive theories focus on what drives or attracts people.
The mentioned theories stem from the idea that people have certain needs and/or desires that they transform into internal ones and give a subjective character to (in other words, internalize) during maturation.
The mentioned theories describe what exactly motivates individuals to desire what they do, and what factors in their environment can influence whether they will do certain things.
Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory" are two authoritative content theories.
Essentially, when leaders are leading their former colleagues, two types of behavior can arise. At one end of the spectrum, there will be attempts to remain "one of the guys" (or "one of the girls").
A manager of this type may experience difficulties with evaluating work performance, making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, delegating responsibility, and holding culprits accountable.
Another extreme is a situation where a person changes beyond recognition — feels the need to change everything the team has done so far and appropriate it for themselves.
Ultimately, the leader bears the responsibility for the team's success and failures.
Often, this type of behavior ends in quarrels between the leaders and the remaining members of the team.
Virtual teams should adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some slight differences.
Typically, virtual team members act as a contact center for the corresponding real-world group.
Considering that such teams can meet regardless of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be understood by local management.
Another unique component of distributed virtual teams is the presence of a genuine "out-of-sight team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
A leadership team to which each member defers is a so-called "invisible team." It sets the standards for each member.
What reason might an organization have for wanting to undergo the lengthy procedure of becoming a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
Creativity and ingenuity can manifest when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization.
Thus, the process used by an organization whose employees strive to collaboratively overcome an obstacle can lead to the emergence of a new, innovative process that satisfies customer needs.
The organization's management should create a culture characterized by innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning. Only then can the organization be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), the continuous approach represents a method by which organizations can achieve greater efficiency.
A theoretical approach to the study of cognition is supported by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. Consequently, the area of research narrows and becomes more precise.
The research results obtained by scientists are confirmed by the existence of a close relationship between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It has long been known that various types of traumatic brain injuries, focal lesions, formations, plaques, pathological changes, and tumors in the brain affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and processes within it that were previously unknown to us.
Thanks to this, we obtain a huge amount of materials and data for building simulation models, which, in turn, help us understand the processes that occur in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" usually evokes associations with science fiction, in reality, AI is a very important field of computer science that deals with the study of behavior, the learning process, and the intellectual adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes attempts to make machines automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
As an example, one can cite planning and control, the ability to respond to customer requests and technical issues, as well as recognize faces, voices, and handwriting.
They have emerged as distinct disciplines that study real-life problems and offer solutions for them.
Nowadays, AI is often used in economics, medicine, technical and military fields. Furthermore, it is a component of software for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions form a significant part of school education. Often, the teacher takes students to places that are impossible to reach by bus.
With the help of modern technologies, it is possible to organize virtual tours. Students can explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of works of art. And all this without leaving the classroom.
Participating in virtual tours together is also a very good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences in future lessons.
Students at Bennett School in North Carolina, for example, create a website about their annual trip to the state capital, and they redesign it every year, but the old versions remain online in the form of an archive.
Furthermore, blogging can improve students' writing skills. Although at the beginning of blogging their grammar and spelling often "limp," this, as a rule, changes for the better, thanks to the presence of an audience.
Considering that students are usually the most demanding audience, the blog author, in order to avoid criticism, is doing everything possible to improve their style.
Besides this, blogging "helps students better understand the world around them." The need to maintain audience interest inspires them and forces them to remain capable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging fosters collaboration and encourages students to learn far more than a traditional school approach offers.
If students use blogs properly, they "will be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; active response to online materials will help students define their own position on what is written by others, as well as express their own views on specific issues" (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa is an interesting and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find numerous art galleries and museums, which offer the opportunity to get acquainted with the country's past and its present.
Niagara Falls lies further south, while to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its pristine natural beauty.
That's why, and for many other reasons, tourists, visitors, and other foreigners consider Ontario to be a typical Canadian province.
Significant portions of its territory, located further north, are very sparsely populated, and some areas are almost completely desolate wilderness.
For comparison of population, one can cite the following fact, which surprises many: the number of African Americans in the USA exceeds the total number of citizens in Canada.
East African islands are located near the east coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Undoubtedly, Madagascar is the largest of them. When it comes to wildlife, it can be compared to a separate continent.
Almost all of the smaller islands are either independent states or belong to France. They are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
Moreover, the Arabs brought Islam with them to these lands, and this religion quickly spread in the Comoros Islands and on the island of Mayotte.
The beginning of European influence and the policy of colonialism dates back to the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope.
The northern border of this region is the Sahel, while the southern and western borders are the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female tourists are advised to always say they are married, even if they are not.
Besides, it might be helpful to wear a ring (one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, they may encounter behavior that seems like harassment to them. Local residents may often bother female tourists, grab their hands, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and boldly stand up for your opinion (regardless of cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!).
Modern Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used this city as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the 1755 earthquake, they abandoned the place.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Beida. The name Casablanca was given to the city by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
Near the Medina's Old City, one can quickly find places that sell traditional Moroccan products – leather goods, pottery, tagines, hookahs, and various toys, but all of them are exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from the border with Rwanda, which is popular with tourists.
In 2002, Goma was wiped off the face of the earth by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. It buried most of the city's streets, mainly in the city center.
Despite the city of Goma itself being relatively safe, venturing outside its limits warrants a little investigation to find out if there is active fighting in the North Kivu province at a given moment.
Furthermore, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano. It also offers very cheap services for those who enjoy watching mountain gorillas – it's hard to find more attractive prices in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
Due to the relative inaccessibility of Timbuktu, its name began to be used as a metaphor for distant, exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and the presence of an airport, Timbuktu today is a city plagued by poverty.
In 1990, due to the threat from desert sands, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
Henry Louis Gates dedicated a lot of attention to this city in the PBS program "Wonders of the African Continent."
Compared to the rest of the country's cities, this city stands out even more because it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa. It is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern boundary runs along the Crocodile River.
The park's area is 19,500 km². It has 14 ecozones, each inhabited by different animals and growing different plants.
It represents one of the most interesting places in the country, and is also considered the most significant of South Africa's National Parks.
As in all national parks in the Republic of South Africa, the park charges a daily entrance fee and levies an environmental fee on visitors.
Furthermore, it may be advantageous to purchase a so-called Wild Card — a pass that grants access to several parks in Southern Africa or all national parks of South Africa.
The name of the country Hong Kong is borrowed from Hong Kong Island, which is a center of attraction for many tourists.
Hong Kong's beautiful buildings, which shape the city's architectural appearance, are compared to a gleaming bar graph, and the waters of Victoria Harbour only emphasize its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be enjoyed by leaving the island and heading to the Kowloon waterfront located opposite it.
A significant portion of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly situated along the northern coast on reclaimed land.
In the past, this place was seized by colonizers from Great Britain, so if you want to see evidence of the country's colonial past with your own eyes, you should start right here.
The Sundarbans forest is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and the interior of India.
UNESCO declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in India is called "Sundarban National Park."
It's not just mangrove swamps that are called forests, it's also some of the last remaining dense jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain and have survived to this day.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which water bodies or swamps occupy about one-third.
The Sundarbans forest has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and currently, according to reports, 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer are found in this region.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (which is located across the river) throughout the day. However, in most cases, they leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar (which is in the Bumthang district).
Due to the fact that intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to purchase tickets a couple of days before the trip.
Comfortable and reliable small Coaster buses manufactured in Japan serve most areas.
A minibus taxi is a comfortable and convenient way to reach nearby places, such as the cities of Punakha (fare: 200 ngultrums) and Paro (fare: 150 ngultrums).
The bridge spanning the Oyapock is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the banks of the Oyapock River, on which two cities are located — Oyapock (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock (French Guiana).
The height of the two pylons is 83 meters. The length of the bridge is 378 meters. The roadway consists of two lanes, each 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The bridge was only opened to traffic in March 2017, despite its construction being completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will become fully functional in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani, who led a semi-nomadic life of hunting and also engaged in subsistence agriculture, were the most significant group of indigenous people who inhabited the territory of modern-day Eastern Paraguay.
Other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Payagua and Guaycuru, lived in the Chaco region. To survive, they hunted, fished, and gathered.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," actually emerged in the 16th century when Spanish conquistadors encountered the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a three-hundred-year period of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to preserve its originality and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, you can watch smaller tournaments and matches here.
Information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be obtained from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP). It is worth the same as the British pound (GBP).
On the Falkland Islands, currency can only be exchanged at the single bank in the entire country, located in Port Stanley opposite the "FIC West" store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted for payment anywhere on the islands. In addition, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley itself.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted. However, they might accept British or American cash; check with the owners in advance about their preferred method of payment.
It is practically impossible to exchange the local currency outside the Falkland Islands, so do it before you leave.
When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in Montevideo, and vice versa. The reason is that the city is located south of the equator.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above +30°C in the summer months are common.
Winters there can be deceptively cold: the thermometer rarely drops below zero, but due to the wind combined with the humidity, the temperature feels lower than it actually is.
The amount of precipitation remains almost constant throughout the year, so there are no distinct wet or dry seasons here.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are used to seeing people, you should not feed or disturb them – wild animals remain wild.
Park authorities advise staying at least 100 yards (meters) away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (meters) away from other wild animals!
Bisons, moose, deer, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of going on the attack, regardless of how docile they may seem.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year due to a lack of proper distance. Do not approach closely, as these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous.
Also keep in mind that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so do not wear or cook food with a strong scent and keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city, home to just under 40,000 people, is located on the island of Upolu.

The assassination of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III ended a peaceful assembly in the city, which took place during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
Due to Auckland being located between two harbours, there are many beaches here. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches are located near North Harbour. They stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south, along the coast of the Pacific Ocean.
Here, almost all the beaches are sandy, it's a safe place for swimming, and most have shade from semi-deciduous trees.
In the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers (central Auckland district), the beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitematā Harbour.
These are sometimes crowded beaches for families with many shops. It is safe to swim here.

The local tap water is perfectly safe and drinkable. However, if you still have any concerns, finding bottled water is not a problem.
The idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. Espresso is a small portion of black coffee, cappuccino is rich with cream rather than foam, and tea is brewed without milk.
The hot chocolate is truly just like the one in Belgium. Fruit juices cost quite a lot, but the taste is excellent.
Reef trips take place year-round and in large numbers, but injuries and trauma from any of the aforementioned causes are rare.
Still, we advise you to follow the advice of the authorities, comply with all requirements, and carefully monitor warnings about the need to adhere to safety rules.
Box jellyfish are found from October to April near beaches and around river estuaries north of the town of 1770. Occasionally, they can be seen outside of this period as well.
Sharks are indeed present here, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks avoid people and therefore swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles mainly live not in the ocean, but in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows a traveler not to worry, because they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often deal with specific hotels. However, you may be able to book other accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers to and from, or even combined packages with flights and hotel accommodation.
Moreover, if you need time to consider the offer or obtain any other documents (such as a visa) that are necessary to get to your destination, the travel agent can hold your booking.
It is recommended to send your proposals for changes to the conditions or requests to the tour agent, and not directly to the hotel.
The vast majority of music festival attendees choose to stay at the event, and, according to most attendees, this is an extremely important experience.
You'll have to arrive early if you want to find a spot near the music area in the campsite.
Remember that even if the performances on the main stages end, there may still be festival venues where music will play late into the night.
At some festivals, families with young children can use special campsites.
We advise checking where your cabin is located if you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter – passage through ice can be accompanied by a terrible noise and cracking, which is especially disturbing for people with increased sensory sensitivity.
The St. Petersburg cruise program includes time spent in the city. Passengers on these cruises do not require visas (see conditions).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into making sure guests spend as much time as possible there and spend as much money as possible. To this end, casinos have no windows or clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment. All this is done to keep guests in a good mood and not wanting to leave the casino.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered on the house. However, all outstanding players know the importance of staying sober, as intoxication hinders clear thinking.
Snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures – all of this should be taken into account by anyone planning to visit northern latitudes or cross mountain passes.
The coefficient of friction is low on snowy and icy roads, so you can't drive as if there's just asphalt under the wheels.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can accumulate in a very short time that you'll get stuck.
Furthermore, visibility may be limited due to snowfall or blizzards, or ice accretion or condensation on car windows.
At the same time, snowy weather and ice are common occurrences for many countries, and traffic there is not interrupted throughout the year.
The most popular tourist attraction in Africa is probably the safari, and for many tourists, it is the most exciting part of their trip.
In common usage, the term "safari" refers to a land journey, particularly through the savanna, where one can see the beautiful wild African environment.
As a rule, individual animals, including giraffes and elephants, approach vehicles closely, and even standard equipment can guarantee good visibility.
In Lviv, it's better to observe cheetahs and leopards with binoculars, as they can sometimes be very cautious.
A hike that takes several hours, or even several days, is called a walking safari. It is also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing."
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Individual competitions will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the first city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice – they were first held here in 1964.
The situation may be complicated if you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced.
Cancellation policies may vary, but generally, as of the end of March, coronavirus epidemic cancellation policies do not cover July 2020, when the Olympics are supposed to take place.
It is expected that ticket prices for most events will range from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, with standard tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
If you iron damp clothes, they will dry faster. Many hotels rent out ironing boards and irons, even if they are not in the room.
You can try using a hairdryer if you don't have an iron handy or don't want to wear ironed socks.
Try not to overheat the fabric too much (as this can cause it to shrink or even, in extreme cases, burn).
Water can be purified in various ways, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
Boiling water in some places can take as little as one minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have varying degrees of effectiveness, so if you have any doubts, you should consider the advisability of buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are uncharacteristic of their native region.
Pests can cause irritation (and in the worst cases, even allergic reactions), spread poisons and infections, and also spoil food.
Usually, infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing a person are not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Tourists heading to countries where taxes are very high can often save a good amount of money, especially on goods like tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
The most difficult driving conditions are on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway – on the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, as the road here often goes through wilderness.
If you have limited experience driving on rural roads, always remain attentive: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes, and unexpected turns here.
The speed limits here are noticeably lower than the preceding and following stretches — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it is very important to adhere to them strictly.
Interesting fact: the mobile signal is much stronger here than along many other stretches of road, say, near "Pennsylvania Wilds".
Pastries in Germany are quite good, and in Bavaria, like its southern neighbor Austria, they are quite hearty and diverse.
Fruit flour products are widely popular, with apples added year-round, and in the summer, also cherries and plums.
Hazelnut, almond, and other forest nuts can be found in many German baked goods. Strong coffee is often a good partner for popular cakes.
If you are looking for a small but calorie-rich pastry, try the one that, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with meat or vegetables, seasoned with herbs and spices.
There are two types of curry. It can be dry or wet. It all depends on how much liquid is in it.
In the northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is typically added to curry, while in southern India and some other coastal regions, simply coconut milk.
Indonesian food is cooked on 17,000 islands. It should be noted that Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, in the absence of further clarification, the term most often refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now you can taste Javanese cuisine throughout the archipelago. It widely features a variety of simple, spicy dishes. Most often you can find seasonings and aromatic additives that Javanese people love - peanuts, red hot chili peppers, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hang down from both sides of the saddle and serve as footrests for the rider.
They give the rider greater stability, but safety issues can arise because the rider's legs can get caught.
If a rider falls from a horse, their foot can get caught in the stirrup. In this case, if the horse gets scared and starts to run, it can drag the rider along. To minimize the risk of this, some safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear special boots with heels and a soft, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, feature safety bars. If a rider pulls back on the stirrup leather during a fall, the safety bars allow them to detach from the saddle.
In the Cochamo Valley, a major climbing destination in Chile known as the Yosemite of South America, there is a vast array of large granite walls and bouldering problems.
Breathtaking views open up from the mountain peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes through the endless labyrinth of rocks.
Alpine skiing sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. They involve descending a snowy surface on skis or a snowboard that are attached to your feet.
For many enthusiasts, skiing is the main activity during their travels, and they are sometimes called "skiing enthusiasts." They might spend their entire vacation skiing in a specific location.
People have been skiing since ancient times - rock paintings depicting skiers date back to approximately 5000 BC.
The history of downhill skiing as a sport began sometime in the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians had already opened the first sports and recreation ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: it's called skiing in remote areas, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is similar to alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, but usually does not include them. The latter are practiced on steep sections of terrain and require significantly stiffer skis and boots.
Compare the ski track to a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you'll be able to travel slightly further than if you were walking. However, you'll very rarely be able to reach the same speed as skiing on a groomed trail without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent. Nevertheless, it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means that tourists and travelers have to go through passport control and submit visa applications repeatedly.
At the same time, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this regard.
You generally have the ability to cross borders without going through passport control again while you are in this zone.
Similarly, if you already have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa to each participating country in the Schengen area, which saves time, money, and simplifies the document processing procedure.
There is no universal definition that determines which manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define goods as antiques if they were made more than 100 years ago.
The concept of "antiques" has certain geographical differences. For example, in North America, the age of an item required for it to be considered antique is less than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be called antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the trading culture that accompanies it is also important for people of other professions.
However, not all Sami were involved in reindeer herding, even though it was traditionally a major occupation. Many lived off fishing, hunting, or similar activities, and reindeer were primarily used as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people have modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, where the Sami live.
Despite its widespread use, especially among other peoples, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and a false image of Roma people.
If a travel warning or advisory is issued for a country you plan to visit, this may affect the terms of your travel medical insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can also take advantage of the advice of government agencies in other countries, not your own, but their advice is intended for citizens of their country accordingly.
Yes, for example, compared to Europeans or Arabs, US citizens may encounter different situations while in the Middle East.
The recommendations and hazard warnings are simply a summary of the country's political situation.
They often express common, superficial, and simplified views, especially when compared to the more detailed information that can be obtained from other sources.
Extreme weather conditions is a general term for dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage, disrupt social life, or lead to human casualties.
Weather can be harsh in any part of the world. Depending on geographical location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions, natural disasters can take various forms.
Among the various forms and consequences of extreme weather conditions are not only strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires, but also tornadoes, cyclones, thunderstorms, and waterspouts.
Blizzards, snowstorms, ice, and dust storms – these are all regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any potential severe weather conditions in their area, as this will affect planned trips.
Any person planning to visit a country where hostilities may be taking place should undergo appropriate professional training.
Perhaps an internet search for "Aggressive Environment Course" will yield the address of a local company.

There are many books and magazines dedicated to survival in the wild, but very few publications dedicated to war zones.
Tourists planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must have the necessary documents for returning to their homeland.
In different countries, governments are prepared to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or make changes to documents in accordance with the desired name and gender to varying degrees.
Foreign governments are ready to implement these documents to very different degrees.
Furthermore, security screening at checkpoints became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
It is unlikely that transgender people who have not yet had surgery will be able to go through a scanner without their dignity and right to privacy being violated.
A rip current, often observed on a reef or similar location, is the returning flow of waves receding from the beach.
The backflow concentrates in a few areas with great depth, which is related to the underwater topography, and there it is possible for a rapid current to form down to great depth.
Fatigue is the cause of most fatalities, when people try to swim back to shore against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it won't be difficult at all to swim back.
Try to head to a place where you won't get caught in the current again. Also, if your skills allow it or if you have been noticed, you can stay in place and wait for rescue.
Because of the shorter honeymoon phase, the shock of returning home can occur earlier than culture shock. It can be more severe and last longer.
Travelers who had no problems adapting to a new culture may find it very difficult to re-adapt to the culture of their homeland.
People who return to their homeland after living a significant amount of time abroad have already become accustomed to the culture of the new country. They have lost some of their habits that were once learned in their native culture.
Probably, when you first visited a foreign country, people were patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need time to adapt.
Many people do not expect at all that understanding and patience are also needed by those travelers who are returning to their homeland.
One of the activities that might interest your children more than anything else is the sound and light show held around the pyramids.
Darkness and silence envelop the pyramids before the start of the show.
Usually, you can always hear the voices of tourists and merchants here. The history of light and sound is like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx serves as a decoration and acts as the narrator of a long story.
The pyramids serve as a backdrop for the narratives, and different pyramids are illuminated from time to time.
Several states claim rights to the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819. The largest number of bases are located here. In 2020, sixteen of them were still operational.
The archipelago is separated from the Peninsula by a distance of 120 km to the north. The largest island is called King George Island, and it is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, one can mention Livingston and Deception Islands, where a picturesque natural harbor was formed in the crater of an active volcano.
Ellsworth Land, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is located south of the peninsula.
At this place, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau. Then they rise again from it, forming the Ellsworth mountain range, 360 km long. The Minnesota Glacier cuts it in half.
The Vinson Massif, the highest mountain range in Antarctica, is located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range. Its highest point is Mount Vinson, which reaches 4,892 m.
A satellite phone may be your only option if you are in a remote area where mobile service doesn't work.
Satellite phones don't usually replace mobile phones because you need to be outdoors and have a direct line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
Shipping companies often use this service, including on cruise ships and in expeditions that require data transmission and voice communication services.
You can find out more about connecting to this service from your local telephone service provider.
The option of combining study with travel is gaining increasing popularity among those planning an academic break.
This option is particularly popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take a gap year before entering university without harming their knowledge.
In fact, in many cases, a year of study abroad can increase your chances of getting into a university or college in your own country.
Tuition for these educational programs is usually charged.
Finland is one of the best places to go rowing or boating. In addition, the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands, located both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You can get by without a yacht on the lakes and archipelagos.
Despite the fact that the largest lakes and coastal archipelagos are actually large enough for any yacht, you can get a completely different experience in smaller boats or even kayaks.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime. Statistically, there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
Similar things can be seen in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but nowhere else (for example, in the Netherlands this figure is one in forty).
Most memorable Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in Russian St. Petersburg.
This means that for several full days you have the opportunity to wander the historical part of the city, returning to the ship for the night.
You will not need a separate visa if you only plan to go ashore on ship-sponsored excursions (information valid as of 2009).
Some cruises offer visits to Berlin, Germany in their brochures. However, looking at a map reveals that Berlin is far from the sea. Furthermore, the cost of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
For people of any age and background, flying on an airplane can be a frightening experience, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced some kind of traumatic event.
There's no need to be ashamed of it: it's the same kind of fear as other personal fears or dislikes of certain things that many people experience.
Understanding how airplanes are constructed and what happens during flight can help some overcome the fear that arises from a fear of the unknown or a loss of control.
Courier services are well paid for the fast delivery of items. In many cases, when delivering business documentation, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs, time is of the essence.
Large companies have their own planes on some routes, however, when it comes to other routes and smaller firms, there was a problem.
If items were sent by air transport, then, possibly, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
Sending it as registered baggage was the only way to get the cargo faster. Airline rules do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, that's where you come in.
The obvious way to end up in first or business class is to shell out huge amounts of money for such a privilege (or, even better, to have a company do it for you).
However, this comes at a price: practice shows that compared to regular economy class, you can pay four times more for business class and more than eleven times more for first class!
Essentially, there's no point in looking for discounts on tickets for direct flights from A to B in first or business class.
Airlines are well aware of the existence of a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay the maximum price for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably. Therefore, they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is the city of Chișinău. The local population speaks Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a country where several nationalities reside and where an ethnic conflict has taken place.
As a result of this conflict in 1994, the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Republic was formed in the eastern part of Moldova. It has its own government and currency, however, no country belonging to the EU recognizes it.
Economic ties were restored between the two mentioned parts of Moldova, despite the lack of success in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Among the cities of Turkey, Izmir is the third largest. Its population is about 3.7 million people. It is a very good transportation hub and the second largest port after Istanbul.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and functioning commercial center, located on a vast bay surrounded by mountains.
Although the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey, its wide boulevards, glazed building facades, and modern shopping centers coexist with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can visit a church that has an unusual octagonal shape. Furthermore, it offers a picturesque view of the neighboring island of Eysturoy.
Above some of the tombs in the churchyard, noticeable marble dove sculptures have been erected.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk through this interesting and unusual village to see its sights.
Nearby, in the northern direction, lies the romantic and captivating town of Sintra, which became famous among residents of other countries after Lord Byron brilliantly described its majesty.
Bus route number 403 of the company "Scoturb" makes regular trips to Sintra. It has a stop at Cabo da Roca.

And in our time, there are still quite a few men and women alive who had to survive here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or who worked here—both Jews and people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the seriousness and respect it deserves. Joking about Nazis or the Holocaust is not appropriate here.
Do not harm this place – do not write or draw graffiti anywhere.
In Barcelona, there are two official languages: Spanish and Catalan. Approximately half of the residents prefer Catalan, and most understand it. And almost everyone speaks Spanish.
At the same time, Catalan is used on most signs, as it is the official language according to the legislation.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used on public transport and in other places.
Ordinary announcements in the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but announcements about sudden disruptions are made via an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Japanese, and Arabic.
Parisians are often called rude, egocentric, and arrogant.
Although it's most often just a misguided stereotype, while in Paris, it's still best to demonstrate your best behavior and be *bien élevé* (well-mannered). Thanks to this, you'll almost certainly have no problems getting around the city.
If you show a little politeness, the Parisians' harsh behavior will quickly disappear.
The large territory of the Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with forest. Here you can mostly find beech, Canadian spruce and various other coniferous trees. There is also a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
Thanks to a wide range of microclimates, diverse soil types, and varying altitudes, a multitude of plant communities can be found here.

Besides various common species, this place is inhabited by such rare animals as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie.
Women visiting monasteries should wear skirts that cover their knees. In addition, their shoulders should also be covered.
In almost all monasteries, women who are unaware of these requirements are indeed offered headscarves. However, if you bring your own, especially if it is brightly colored, the monks or nuns at the entrance will be very pleased.
A similar requirement applies to men as well – they must wear trousers below the knee.
They can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after every guest, so you might feel uncomfortable in these skirts. The universal size is offered for men!
As with the cuisines of many other regions of the Mediterranean, Majorcan cuisine is characterized by dishes made with vegetables, bread, and meat (mainly pork). Olive oil is also added to all dishes.

Even when they stand in the middle of a sentence, all nouns, as well as the pronoun Sie (that is, "You"), are capitalized.
With the help of this method, it is always possible to distinguish verbs from nouns that denote objects.
Perhaps this also simplifies reading, but it complicates writing somewhat because you need to understand whether a verb or an adjective in its substantive form is being used.
Most words in Italian are pronounced exactly as they are written, so the pronunciation here can hardly be called difficult.
The main focus should be on the letters "c" and "g" because their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
The consonants "r" and "rr" must be pronounced differently: "caro" translates as "dear," while "carro" means "chariot."
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly linear grammar.
Therefore, after studying this grammar textbook, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and will better understand phrases.
There is no doubt that knowing any of the Romance languages makes learning Portuguese much easier.
However, people who can speak a little Spanish might jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is similar to it and therefore does not require separate study.
As of today, pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete and function as museums or educational centers.
Usually, such observatories were located in cities or on university campuses, where they were easier to reach than modern observatories. The reason is simple – nowadays, light pollution is a much bigger problem than it used to be.
The majority of research telescopes today are grandiose objects of gigantic proportions, usually located in peripheral regions with optimal atmospheric conditions.
"Hanami," which means cherry blossom viewing, entered Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
China is considered the birthplace of this concept, where plum blossoms were favored.
The first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the Emperor of Japan only for himself and other court aristocrats.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so don't be tempted to pull out "just one" specimen.
If you start collecting "specimens" while visiting an officially landscaped garden, you will also be kicked out without any discussion.
Overall, Singapore is a safe place to stay and get around, and you can buy almost everything you need here after you arrive.
However, if you found yourself just a few degrees north of the equator, in the "high tropics," you would have to deal with both the heat (all the time) and the bright sun (when the sky is clear, which is much less often).
Several buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
You should make sure that the bus you intend to take is actually going to Hebron, and that its route doesn't end in the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

In Christianity, the holiday celebrated as the day of Jesus's birth is called Christmas. It is one of the most important holidays for believers.
Many of the customs inherent in this holiday have been adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians in all countries of the world.
On Easter night, there is a tradition of not sleeping, but staying somewhere in an open place to greet the sunrise.
In Christianity, of course, there are certain theological interpretations of this tradition, but it may simply represent a fertility ritual and the arrival of spring.
Easter service is usually held by more traditional churches on Saturday evening of Easter weekend, and parishioners often begin the celebrations at midnight, commemorating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially reached the islands either swam or flew there.
The giant tortoise became the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands. This happened because mammals were unable to migrate due to the great distance between the island and the mainland.
Many mammals have appeared in the Galapagos since the arrival of humans there, including goats, horses, cows, cats, dogs, and rats.
You'll be able to experience what polar night is like firsthand if you travel to the Arctic or Antarctica in winter. During this time, the sun doesn't rise above the horizon at all.
This allows you to admire the Northern Lights, because the sky will be dark almost around the clock.
Besides, you will have the opportunity to enjoy the stars, given that these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not a problem.
Japanese work culture differs from what people in Western countries are used to. It is more hierarchical and formal.
Typical business attire includes suits, and colleagues address each other by last names or job titles.
The importance of harmonious working relationships cannot be overstated. Group efforts, rather than personal achievements, are prioritized.
Often, employees' decisions must be approved by their superiors. They are expected to unquestioningly obey the orders of higher-ranking managers.
