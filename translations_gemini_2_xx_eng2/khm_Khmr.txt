It not only confirms the general theory that some dinosaurs, at least, had feathers, but it also provides details about fossils that are generally impossible to ascertain, such as color and three-dimensional form.
Scientists say that this animal's fur is brown on top and yellow underneath.
This new discovery also provides a broader understanding of the evolution of bird wings.
Because dinosaur wings weren't well-developed and had what's called a rachis (central wing shaft), but possessed other wing characteristics - feathers and barbs - researchers have found that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development that built upon these features.
The structure of one wing suggests that the wings were not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or for display purposes only. Researchers have shown that even though this is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult feathers and not downy feathers.
Researchers pointed out that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows dinosaur feathers of a mature dinosaur and is not chicken feathers.

Even though much of the work is theoretical, this program was written to encourage observations originating from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The impact this group is investigating is caused by the gravitational force between the baryonic matter of galaxies and the dark matter of the Milky Way galaxy.
Just as the moon struggles to hold onto Earth's gravity, creating tides, the Milky Way galaxy struggles to resist the pull of the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way.
Scientists can summarize that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory states that the dark matter surrounding a galaxy exists around the galaxy in a halo-like structure and is made up of many small particles.

Candidates may send their representatives to witness all aspects of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the ballots under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, saw her finish in tenth place in the Sitting Women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind first-place Claudia Loesch of Australia, and 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth-place Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's team failed to finish their runs, and a total of 45 skiers out of 117 in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered laptops and mobile phones that were stolen.
Sub-Inspector D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The defendants are named Namedas Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused was wearing a mask when appearing in court.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
Regardless, the driver sustained a severe head injury.
The road where the collision occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency services extricate the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was sent to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, charged with the murder of his own son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be compromised because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the court considered the publication or posting of the photograph to be highly prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists appear to be treading a dangerous path if they publish photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for all prosecutions, indicated to reporters that it would not comment until a decision on charges had been made.
According to this leaked document, there is reference to the border dispute that Palestine wants, based on several borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other reported topics included the future status of Jerusalem, which is important for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continued military presence in the valley for ten years when the agreement was signed, while the Palestinians agreed to such a presence for only five years.
Forest conservationists are responsible for overseeing the sprayers in the pest control experiment to ensure the trial is properly monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
In partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers are selected under the Sporting Shooters' Association Hunting Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial spraying operation received extensive safety briefings and training.
Yesterday, former Haitian President Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It was Martelly's fifth CEP ranking in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Committee offered recommendations on the early resignation of the NEC (National Election Committee), as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
This mission is Martelly's response to the growing wave of protests against the government that began in October.
Some violent protests have occurred due to the failure to organize elections that were planned since 2011.
There are reports of approximately 60 instances of iPod malfunctions overheating, resulting in a total of six instances of fire and causing minor injuries to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that the ministry was also aware of the 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious cases."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in providing the report a "truly regrettable act."
An earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (equivalent to 09:19 PM Universal Time on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said that no damage had been reported in the country.
Therefore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been freed, and at least six hostages have been confirmed dead in the past.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released before the Filipino photographer.
The photographer then took the place of an elderly woman while she went to the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and also began a career in medicine.
He received training as a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Mr. Liggins began investigating the provincial labor force during his free time.
His research shows that if the hormone is administered, it will accelerate infant lung development towards maturity.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found flight data recordings from two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
The wrestlers also showed respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first badass queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the deuce. One of a kind, like no other. A badass woman."
Wrestler Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented, “Luna was just as weird as me…maybe even weirder than me…love and miss her…hope she’s in a better place.”
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Then Prime Minister Julia Gillard asserted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the people who participated in this poll hold this view: that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
A strong poll showed that 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness remains uncertain.
He couldn't use the medication he needed for his pain because it was prohibited during this sporting event.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Many people verified these findings using different hardware and software in early February, and they announced it on Tuesday as well.
Asteroids may be the source of water to Earth, along with organic matter that could form protein structures that support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a very long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor of the state earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumor as "useless and foolish political talk."
He was expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly closer together, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older, land-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport put on, and the overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities will not be available.
Fears about logistical shortcomings have raised the possibility that the game will be forced to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study, published on Thursday in the journal Science, reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, even though this process was believed to take much longer, due to interbreeding between local Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortis) and migratory cactus finches (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of forms. It can be hammered into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be woven back together. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It was made thin and placed on other metals. Sometimes it was made very thin to be used as decoration for hand-painted images in books, which were called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH level of a chemical substance. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice indicator changes color depending on whether the chemical is an acid or a base (alkaline).
pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in a chemical substance that has been tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (because a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry ingredients together, then use clean, damp hands to knead it into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, which can be detected in advance, and then form a type of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
The remaining debris of drainage systems were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Egypt, Persia, and ancient China also had toilets in ancient times. Sometimes, in Roman civilization, toilets were part of communal bathhouses in homes, used by both men and women together in a mixed setting.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive signals and then transmit those signals back to Earth almost continuously.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere interferes with some of our light and visibility.
To deploy satellites or telescopes into space, giant rockets, over 100 feet tall, are required.
The bicycle has profoundly changed the entire world. The biggest change it brought us is a convenient and fastest means of transportation.
It brought trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Beneath them are several mid-sized tiger species that prey on other mid-sized animals such as rabbits, squirrels, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including wild cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and various birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of being comfortable in their niche, a specialized task that each species of tiger has, which allows it to sustain itself without competition from other animals.
The lion is the most cooperative cat, living in large groups called prides.
A herd is formed by one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and their young.
Generally, women have close relationships with each other, becoming a large family of sisters and daughters.
It's surprising to see a proud lion behaving like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals with similar social behavior (but unlike other big cats), and they are also extremely dangerous to their prey.
An athlete with a very strong physique is like a tiger that can climb mountains (albeit not very well), swim, long jump, and lift weights five times stronger than human strength.
Tigers belong to the genus Panthera, the same genus as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four big cat species are the only big cats that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not quite the same as the full-throated roar of a lion, but it's like the sound we make when reading a sentence with a word that needs to be shouted.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can find them. Almost every animal that a wild cat hunts is much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that leopards hunt prey by tracking scents and sniffing the ground in areas they frequent.
In the dark of night, they can see clearly and travel smoothly. Leopards hunt for food by hiding and waiting to ambush their prey.
When a small group of organisms is separated from the larger group they used to belong to (such as if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so they are not likely to return), they generally tend to live in a different environment than the one they used to live in before.
This new environment has many different resources and competitors. Therefore, newcomers will need unique characteristics or different adaptations to become stronger competitors than what they previously needed.
The indigenous population hasn't changed; they still need the same adaptation as before.
Sooner or later, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they start to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will see a real difference, to the point that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and plants absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (breathe out).
Plants produce food from the sun through photosynthesis. Plants also provide shade.
We build houses from trees and make clothes from plants or trees as well. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive either.
The Mosasaurus was such a powerful predator of its time that it feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaws are lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, combined with extra ridges on the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that passes through it escapes.
We are not sure either, but it probably has blisters on its tongue. Its prey includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and sometimes it even eats its own kind.
It also attacked anything that entered the water. Even giant dinosaurs like the sharp-toothed T. rex were no match for it.
While we are immune to most of their food, the Romans certainly had their share of strange and unusual banquet foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and the women sat on chairs to eat their meals, the rich men preferred to feast together, sitting elegantly, enjoying the fresh air, and eating their food.
Ancient Roman cuisine likely did not include foods that were brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, and cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey either.
The Babylonians built magnificent temples for each of their gods, which were considered the gods' royal residences.
People will bring offerings to God, and the monks (priests) will arrange to fulfill all of God's needs through prayers and various ceremonies.
Every temple has a temple courtyard open to the sky, followed by a sanctuary inside, which only the priestly class could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special shrine for the gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses are less important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was lived in open fields.
The woman is cooking food in the house's porch/eaves. The shop only opens the stall that faces the road. Stones were used to build the house.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was settled sporadically. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his theory, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Each of the 'Scandinavian' countries has many differences in terms of the people, kings, dress, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that treasure maps are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Even though there's writing on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text below the document is written upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that during the early days, the large sheets of paper (which measured 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) were rolled up into bundles for storage.
Therefore, the bookmark was likely added simply as a placeholder.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was governed by the Vichy French state. These people were French who had made a peace treaty with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded southern France, an invasion known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned back towards Germany.
Civilization is a great culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and cooperate socially.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," meaning civil. The word "civil" is related to the Latin words "civis" (citizen), meaning civilian, and "civitas" (city), meaning city or state, and in another sense, it also means the size of a society.
The state is the nation's leadership. Culture and civilization reflect the sharing and continuation of knowledge from one generation to the next, a lasting legacy, and equitable dissemination.
Small cultures typically disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government—with only a single-body legislature—under the Articles of Confederation.
The assembly has no power to levy taxes, and due to the absence of a national legislature or judiciary, it is dependent on state authorities, which generally do not cooperate in enforcing all of its laws.
It also does not have the authority to reject tax and customs laws between the individual states.
Before the laws were amended, all states had to unanimously agree, and the states were less concerned about the central government because their representatives were often absent.
The Italian and German national football teams are the second most successful teams in the world, having both won the FIFA World Cup, with Italy being the champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with many Italians competing in international sports and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Based on its geography, and because Japan has many clusters/groups of islands, Japan often receives the title of "archipelago nation."
The initial discovery of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and noted the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous Austronesian grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar crops.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty army (1644-1912) occupied the west and north coast of Taiwan, and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the territory of Taiwan to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Windows.
Most of the buildings on the intricate perimeter have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how the building originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size near the film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by digital image sensors.
35mm format is actually confusing, being 36mm wide by 24mm tall.
The ratio of this size (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is called 3:2.
Many common configurations (e.g., the configuration of an APS group) are equal to or approximate this ratio.
The most violated and mocked rule of photography is actually an easy guideline to create compelling photos while maintaining a sense of visual order.
It is suggested that the most effective places for key photographic subjects are at the intersections that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under intense criticism.
For over a thousand years, European countries have formed alliances with Christianity as their state religion, despite having different languages, traditions, and customs.
His power over all sectors influenced everyone from the king to the common people.
A key principle of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the financial offerings of church congregations are established for this very reason.
The central authority of the Church has been located in Rome for nearly a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led to many questions about whether this religious doctrine has been fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of war, the British Empire initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy has been proven effective by cutting off crucial military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally recognized international law, as defined by numerous international agreements dating back two centuries.
England destroyed by mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean, endangering neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude that brought about the victory of the most citizens and countries was pacifism and isolationism.
After being shocked and witnessing the brutality of war during World War I, many nations did not want to experience such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with Edison in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time. Each era of China, or each family that held power, was a different dynasty.
From one dynasty to another was an unstable era, marked by the division of many provinces. The most well-known period is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those times, a fierce war also broke out between many nobles, who fought each other to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history, with countless people dying in battles to sit on the high throne in the palace of Xi'an.
It has many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from dictatorship to republic, nationalism, and the specific belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Similarly, after positions in the revolution were opened to all male candidates, it allowed those with ambition and success to thrive.
The military is the same: promotions depend not only on a person's rank but also on their ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a strong interest in matters beyond worldly life. He used to frequently visit a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light) for contemplation.
He secluded himself in a cave and escaped death at that time, and then bore clear physical witness to the spiritual presence upon Muhammad.
Located atop a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is extremely isolated from the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find at all, even if someone knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the beautiful and clear sky and the mountains that surround it. This small world can be seen or heard within this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that remains standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, pyramids are among the many large pyramids built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis, located in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains numerous pyramids (including one very large pyramid), many smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while the smaller pyramids, tomb shafts, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and members of the royal family.
The "caret" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "circumflex" symbol looks like a staple or a square with the bottom missing.
"Above" means you need to grab the end and push the lever, and "Below" means you need to grab the base (where your hand holds the code lever) and then pull the code lever.
An upstroke typically produces a soft sound, while a downstroke is heavier and crisper.
Don't be afraid to write your own fingerings, but remember that the printed fingerings are there for a musical reason, so usually respect them.
The detestable King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, his two young children (Marie-Thérèse, age 11, and Louis-Charles, age four), and the king's sister, Princess Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of women from the markets to return to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris by carriage through a crowd screaming and threatening against the King and Queen.
A diverse crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a member of the crowd shook his head at a royal guard who had been murdered at the Palace of Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The cost of the American imperialist war to seize the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a significant portion of expenses and the interest on bonds taken out in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking centers.
Indeed, the immense profits derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people would become the foundational profit for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to the order's creation.
The era in which those events occurred is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages, which followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, from the impetus of technology or the necessity of technology to the understanding that human destiny is driven by fundamental reasons related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism offer two general ideas: first, that technological development follows a path largely independent of political or cultural influence; and second, that technology "impacts" society in relevant ways, rather than being shaped by social conditions.
For example, some might say that the invention of the car led to road development.
However, the national road network cannot afford to build roads solely for a small handful of cars, therefore a new production method has been developed to reduce the cost of vehicles.
Having a large number of vehicles also leads to more accidents or crashes on the roads, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques for repairing damaged car bodies.
Romanticism has a significant element of cultural determinism, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and subsequently, customs and culture related to that geography arose; and these points, being in harmony with one's place in society, were considered superior to laws arbitrarily defined.
In the sense that Paris is known as the modern capital of the present day, Constantinople was considered the modern capital of feudal Europe.
Its famed reputation for magnificence began around 400 BC and continued until 1100 BC.
During the twelfth century, its situation declined, mainly because the Crusaders offered gifts like silk fabrics and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine Empire's market offered.
It was at this moment that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Originally, clothing was heavy and influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because the communication networks were slow, Western styles lagged behind the times by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. The biggest development occurred when people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is a type of agriculture that is practiced to produce enough food only to meet the needs and feed the farmer's family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple organic system that uses indigenous seeds preserved within the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other related simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together like-minded individuals because society ignores them, allowing them to cultivate an identity for themselves.
Cultural groups can differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Characteristics that define a subculture as different include language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of ethnic cultural groups often signal their membership to each other through unique styles or symbols, including clothing brands, specific preferences, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw upon cases of deprived children who have experienced neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse and who have not been socialized with adults as they grew up.
Children like these are called "destitute and helpless" or are still wandering. Some orphaned children are confined by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, abandonment of such children is due to parents not accepting their own children who are mentally disabled, intellectually challenged, or disabled, etc.
Homeless children may have suffered abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away from somewhere.
Others were accused of being raised by animals. Still others were said to have lived in the forest on their own.
When raised by something other than humans, children who behave like wild animals (with physical limitations) are almost identical to animals and require special attention, such as dealing with fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, incidental learning suddenly stands out more.
Mentoring is not a method of learning, but rather a support provided to individuals undergoing new learning experiences, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Assistance to students can be tangible and concrete, and teachers can also be a form of assistance, and even the paperclip in Microsoft Office can be helpful.
The virtual tutor is created within the computer program and it is designed to ask questions, provide hints, and explain the process of potential obstacles for students to solve on their own.
Children are placed in care centers for many reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking care, nurturing, and education, yet these children have experienced such a life.
We consider childcare systems as a safe place for all these children.
Our childcare system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Care and nurturing should provide for all needs that were previously unmet in the home.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to the addition of dimensions related to methods of use and satisfaction, etc.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been proposed as key motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" were also identified as new motivational aspects, which were defined by researchers Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to various websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of various facial expressions and micro-expressions, as well as facial movements that can last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying or not by accurately interpreting brief utterances.
Oliver Sacks, in his writing about a presidential address, illustrated how people unable to understand the speech due to brain damage were, paradoxically, able to accurately assess its sincerity.
He further suggested that the ability to interpret human character might be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: recessive and dominant.
Genetic drift adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Division and reunification alternated back and forth between the two groups from generation to generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for mammals with digestive systems like humans to meet their amino acid requirements solely from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences such as: impaired growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest plant resources to find will become sources of protein, readily available in plant leaves and vegetables, but primates like us have a hard time digesting these foods unless they are cooked thoroughly.
On the contrary, food derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but it also provides a wealth of protein containing essential amino acids.
In conclusion, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestral grandparents solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that baboons do today on the savannah and woodland.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking yourself during your normal sleep and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This method can be easily done by using a silent alarm clock to gently rouse you, without jolting you awake.
If you find yourself hitting the snooze button, you can put it on the other side of the bedroom to help force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other anomaly-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which are diuretics) before bed, forcing a person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is related to and inversely proportional to the amount of stress within their body and spirit.
Lower stress leads to increased positivity in the energy of life. Each person has the power to find complete peace and happiness.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is expanded by the Mahayana path of compassion and by utilizing various techniques through Indian yoga practices.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It contains yoga, Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love, all of which.
By practicing Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are awakened, and the awareness of enlightenment is generated.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States. At the end of this war, the clash of leadership systems, processes, and cultures led to the fall of many countries.
With two years having passed since the end of the war, former allies had become enemies in the present, and the Cold War had begun.
It would take another 40 years and would be fought in earnest through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other countries as well.
On September 17, 1939, Polish defenses were broken, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans had to be returned by tonight at the latest, at which point more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Red Army had arrived and created the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of eastern Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using cargo ships is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the ocean.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, the navy will also disrupt the ability of your enemies to move their people and goods.
A prominent recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II (WWII). The Americans attempted to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid England.
At the same time, the German navy, especially using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had indeed failed, Germany probably could have conquered Great Britain, just as it had conquered Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Generally, domestic goats are kept in groups on hills or other places with plenty of grazing, where the goat herders are often children or teenagers, similar to shepherds as they are known. This method of herding these animals in groups is still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the plank roads were simply planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed horses to pull loads faster and haul heavier items than the rough roads of the time.
Railway fastening was introduced from the early stages to keep the rails in place. However, gradually they realized it was more effective if they laid them (or placed them).
This has become a common habit, but the iron has been damaged by it rubbing against the wooden wheels of the cart.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete railway was put into operation.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright approximately two million years ago with the emergence of the Homo Erectus species (meaning upright man).
The great apes' ancestors didn't walk upright as much as previously thought.
A unique bipedal creature was discovered in the Australopithecus fossil region dating back 4.2 – 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a way that's better for the environment. We can participate in the environmental movement, and we can become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is only a symptomatic treatment. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we should look for the root cause of the problem and we should disrupt their processes.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of mankind, and the problems have also increased due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of mankind.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the nearby printing press, John Dunlap's printing press.
Over the course of a night, between 150 and 200 copies were created, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the Declaration was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who showed it to his troops in New York City on July 9th. A copy was sent to London on August 10th.
The Dunlap manuscript, a large document of 25 leaves known to still exist, is the longest surviving copy. The original handwritten manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that has continued to survive to this day, and we call those dinosaurs birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still seem to resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like dinosaurs (T-Rex).
Almost every computer in use today relies on information formatted in binary code.
A binary digit can only have one value out of two possible numerical values: 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as bits, which is a computer abbreviation.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Generally, symptoms such as vomiting and nausea are not immediately diagnosable.
The best indication of poisoning from an internal source may be the presence of open medicine containers or toxic chemicals in the house.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "insectoid" is used by insect research scientists in a formal sense for these groups of insects.
This term comes from ancient familiarity with bedbugs - insects that can adapt to live on humans.
Both deadly insects and blood-sucking insects are nest dwellers that have adapted to living in nests or homes.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have blood clots.
To raise children, a couple can decide whether it is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their children.
This couple is probably deciding to make a plan to adopt a child.
In adoption, the biological parents must terminate their parental rights so that another couple can have the right to raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. These methods, in effect, serve as a guide for scientific research.
It's not just one thing; experimentation and testing are a process used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, similar to asking questions and making observations, as well as conducting scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were generally accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greece declined, the West became detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many people have observed that the consistency in physiology and behavior often depends on the recurring cycles of endocrine glands and their production as determined by biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms are not easily entrained to external cues, a phenomenon documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is an organism's inherent timing device that generates and sustains cyclical rhythms, continuing to regulate the duration of cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was a landmark conclusion that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a bacteriophage, or phage virus, to insert its own DNA into bacteria.
They made observations on two experiments: either DNA inside the killer bacteria with radioactive phosphorus, or protein of the killer bacteria with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cell is a germ cell.
Only changes in germ cells can be passed on to children, while changes in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts tourists who are interested in visiting natural areas with the intention of enjoying the scenery, including flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about ecosystems.
Examples include visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car to get to their workplaces, and they also meet other people whose workplaces are the places those drivers have just left.
In this bustling transportation system, everyone is connected and supported by a transportation system heavily reliant on private vehicles.
Science now shows that this massive use of carbon has driven the biosphere out of the relatively stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints regarding water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why does the transportation system cause so much frustration, and why does it fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent, or is something more significant about to happen?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles as individuals, between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the driver seems to be driving smoothly and consistently over a reasonable distance. Therefore, the traffic flow seems reasonably consistent and can be represented by mathematical approximation.
To better describe traffic flow, a relationship is established between three characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of equipment on roadways.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly has helped them evade many enemies easily and made finding food and reproduction easier.
A common characteristic of most insects is their ability to fold their wings back along their body.
This provides them with many diverse small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are common mayflies and butterfly mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people think he is right, but many believe he is wrong. He says that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars as well), revolves around the Earth.
This seems true, because it feels like the Earth isn't moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon River is the largest river on the planet, with a width of 6 miles.
A full percentage of the water that flows from the rivers of planet Earth into the ocean originates from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of tributaries.
Although pyramids were built of stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids are enormous and display perfect construction techniques.
The New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt admired the many monumental structures of their previous leaders, which had stood for over a thousand years.
The total population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for drafting laws and official communications.
Italian is also a language that most government workers use daily, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People had knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper in their time because all these chemical elements can be found in nature in their original form and are easy to dig up using ancient tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things are composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This point is meant to imply that there are four elements (in a single order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though he also developed a theory that these four elements transform into new elements in order to create what we can see.
Alloys are generally composed of two or more metallic elements. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Substances like calcium and potassium are classified as metals. It is also true that silver and gold are metals as well.
You may also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in this universe is made up of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, with hundreds of trillions of them potentially fitting across the period at the end of this sentence.
If so, pencils are a good friend to many people when they are present.
Sadly, as newer writing methods have emerged, the status and usage of pencils have gradually declined.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without needing pencils and pencil sharpeners anymore.
One can only wonder what kind of keyboard will be the newest when it is produced.
A fusion bomb operates on the principle that it generates energy by combining nuclei with protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Split the nucleus again, then release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break apart, with little or no provocation.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
Its crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
Under the sea it is thinner, and under the plateau it is thicker.
There might be more highland areas (of the moon), maria, near that location because the upper layer is thinner than usual, making it easier for volcanic magma to reach the surface.
Substance theory focuses on discovering what makes people choose something, or what attracts people to it.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that must be present within them as they mature into adulthood.
These theories focus on certain human characteristics that make people want what they want and what is in their environment that motivates them to do or not do those things.
Two popular important theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can indicate when a manager is starting to outgrow their former friends. One end of the spectrum is trying to leave behind the "one of the guys" (or gals) persona.
This type of manager has difficulty making inclusive decisions, enforcing discipline, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and treating employees equally.
According to another perspective, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the group has done in the past and make it their own.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to division between the leader and other team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with some slight differences.
The liaison members serve as the point of contact for the rapid response physical team.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet based on different regions and times, which their local leaders may not understand.
The presence of a real "group we do not see" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual group.
"The invisible team" is a management group where each member reports in. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
What is the reason the organization wants to go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One goal in doing so, to put the learning organization concept into practice, is innovation (the use of new ideas or methods).
Creativity and intelligence can emerge when all resources are used effectively in the various operational areas of an organization.
As a result, the organization's collaborative work process in overcoming obstacles can lead to new innovations to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can utilize new ideas or methods, leaders must create a culture of embracing new ideas or methods, as well as sharing knowledge and the organization's learning.
Angel (2006) explains that the Continuum approach is a methodology used to help organizations reach a high level of performance.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of consciousness, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior aids scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, such as trauma, lesions, and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
It provided us with a wealth of information and documentation for creating various simulation models that help us understand the processes in our brain.
Even though AI is strongly defined by science fiction, it has become a significant branch in computer science, studying behavior adaptation, learning, and intelligence in machines.
AI research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include management, planning, and scheduling; the ability to answer customer questions and questions related to their diagnosis; as well as handwritten notes, voice, and faces.
This kind of thing has become a separate discipline focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Current AI systems are frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are incorporated into the functions of home computer software and some video game software.
Field trips are a big part of the class. Often, teachers like to take students to different places without using bus transportation.
Technology brings solutions for virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, explore aquariums through glass, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing about the study visit in person is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences for future classes.
For example: Every year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. Each year the website is updated, but the old websites are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help promote student writing. While students often start writing their blogs with some grammar and spelling problems, the presence of blog viewers leads to the correction of these errors.
Because students are the audience that criticizes the most, bloggers are starting to try and improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Like blog writing, "forcing students to be more aware of the world around them" requires students to be clever and engaging in order to capture the audience's attention (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the normal school day.
The proper use of blogs "can encourage students to be more courageous in analyzing and critiquing through actively responding to materials; students can define their role in the context of other people's writing as well as express their own perspectives on a particular issue" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, boasting numerous galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north lies a haven of untouched natural beauty: Muskoka and even more amazing places beyond.
All of these things and other displays in Ontario are what outsiders might think of as uniquely Canadian.
A large portion of the north has a small population, and some places are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more Black Americans living in America than there are Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean along the east coast of the African continent.
To date, Madagascar is the largest island continent, and when it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is a self-reliant continent.
Most of the small islands are independent countries or affiliated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it began to spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte regions.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century because the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The north of this region borders the Sahel, and the south and west border the Atlantic Ocean.
Women travelers are advised to say they are married, whether they are actually married or not.
Wearing rings is also beneficial (but not extremely expensive ones).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what is considered harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed or touched, for example.
Be strong towards people who are indifferent to you, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether the culture is different or not, it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was then named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive markets for shopping in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like Tagines, pottery, leather goods, pipes for traditional smoking, and the overall appearance of displayed items, but all of that is only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from Mount Nyiragongo, which buried most of the roads in the city, especially in the city center.
While the capital Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma should be researched to understand the combat situation, which continues to occur in North Kivu province.
This city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the most affordable Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. A typical (local) fare is 500 francs for a short ride.
Combined with its remoteness, the word "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for a faraway and exotic land.
Currently, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, the area was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of sand from the desert.
It was a significant juncture in the remarkable public service broadcasting career of Henry Louis Gates in the African world.
This city is strikingly different from other cities in the country because it is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the borders of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern boundary.
That national park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of the many attractions in South Africa and is considered a symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Alongside South African national parks, there is ongoing conservation and an entrance fee to visit the park.
It can also be beneficial for those who purchase a Wild Card, which offers the opportunity to choose entry into a number of parks in South Africa, or even all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the entire territory of Hong Kong and is considered a key location by many tourists.
The rows of skyscrapers in Hong Kong, stretching across the skyline, are likened to a dazzling graph of light posts, reflected on the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite side of the harbor, Kowloon.
A large part of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated in reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colony took as its own, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past, this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland into Bangladesh and India from the coastal region.
The Sundarbans area has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A portion of the forest area within Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not only mangrove forests located in alluvial soil — but they also include some of the vast remnants of swamp forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans area covers an area of 3,850 km², with one-third of this area covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer found in this area.
Buses depart from the bus station in the district (crossing the river) throughout the day, mostly heading east, with Jakar/Bumthang departures at 06:30 and 07:30.
Because local buses are always crowded, you should buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts receive services from small, comfortable, and sturdy Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches across the Oyapock River and connects Oiapoque in Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers reach a height of 83 meters, have a length of 378 meters, and have two small paths that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and traffic will be suspended until March 2017.
This bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are one of the most important indigenous groups living in eastern Paraguay today, living as hunters and gatherers and as semi-settled agriculturalists.
The Chaco region is home to various indigenous tribes, such as the Gekuru and Payagua, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In 16th-century Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," alliances were formed to fight against the Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish people began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely maintained its identity and indigenous character.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest annual sporting event takes place in December at the Polo Field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller matches and competitions can also be seen taking place here at various times throughout the year.
For information on matches and where to buy tickets for polo matches, please check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound, which is equal in value to one British pound.
Money can only be exchanged at the bank on this island, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West department store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the island, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
On remote and isolated islands, credit cards may not be accepted, even if British and US currencies are. Check with the local owner beforehand to determine which forms of payment are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located in the southern hemisphere, it's summer there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located close to the tropics. During the summer months, the temperature typically rises above 30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be much colder than you think: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel much colder than the temperature on the thermometer.
There are no "wet" and "dry" seasons: rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals in this park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild, and we should not throw them food or disturb them.
According to national park officials, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears, and at least 25 meters away from wolves and other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, wolverines, and almost all large animals can attack us.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they do not keep a safe distance. These wild animals are large and very dangerous, so don't get too close to them.
Furthermore, be aware of scents that attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking strongly scented items, and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of under 40,000 people.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the former site of a brutal naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruise ship. The lives of nearly 200 Americans and Germans were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of a paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Numerous beaches have formed due to the separation of the two Auckland harbors. The most popular are located within three areas or sections.
Ness Beach in the Shire of Hastings is situated on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all of this coastline consists of sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive is located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the area of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in Central Auckland.
Sometimes these entire beaches are crowded with families, with many shops lined up near the shore. Swimming is generally safe.
The main local beer is "Number One" beer. It's not a complicated beer, but it's a fun and refreshing beer. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are a better choice.
Tap water in this area is very safe to drink, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the 'white foam' of coffee is considered strange. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with a thick (not stiff) foam, and tea is never drunk with milk.
The hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards. The juice is a little expensive, but it has a delicious, fragrant flavor.
Coral viewing trips are conducted year-round, and incidents caused by coral are rare.
Continue to follow advice from authorities, respect all signage, and focus on safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April 1770. We can occasionally see them in months outside of these as well.
Sharks are real, but they rarely bite humans. Most sharks are very afraid of people and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in living in the ocean, as their primary habitat is along the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind, knowing they will have somewhere to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, even though you may find alternative accommodations like campsites through an agency.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, arranged transportation to/from the airport, or even hotel packages with flights.
They can also hold your booking if you need time to think about this offer or provide other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, any changes or requests should go through the travel agent first, and not be made directly through the hotel.
Some festivals see many concertgoers decide to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want this activity to be successful, you need to start as soon as possible to secure a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage might end, there may be other festival areas that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some campsites have special areas for families with young children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, inspect the cabin location, as the ice passage causes extremely unpleasant noise for those most affected.
A boat trip in St. Petersburg combined with time in the city. Boat passengers are visa-free (please check the conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to make guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings to make guests feel refreshed and satisfied at the venue.
Some places sell alcohol from their homes. However, intoxication impairs decision-making, and all gamblers are well aware of the importance of not getting drunk.
Those driving at high altitudes or crossing mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
Friction is low on icy roads, and you can't drive the same way you would on asphalt.
During a blizzard, snow falls in a very short period of time, often enough to trap you.
Visibility may be impaired by snowfall, blowing snow, or by frost or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and hail conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues with hardly any disruption throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a testament to many more tourists.
The word "safari" is commonly used to refer to land travel to see magnificent African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, try to get close to the cars, so standard equipment is conducive to good sightseeing.
Lions, leopards (a tiger-like species similar to leopards), and tigers sometimes get shy too, and you can see them more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "trekking," "hill walking," "bushwalking," or "foot travel") involves walking, usually lasting for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24th and last until September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, having hosted them in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you may have encountered a slightly difficult situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but by the end of March, various programs' cancellation policies, due to the coronavirus outbreak, did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that tickets for most events will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Some hotels have irons and ironing boards for rent if you don't have one in your room.
If the iron is not working, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer instead, if you have one.
Please be careful not to expose the fabric to too much heat (which can cause it to shrink or burn badly).
There are many different methods of purifying water, which are effective but also have certain drawbacks.
In some areas, boiling water for just one minute is sufficient, while in other places, it takes several minutes.
Water filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Some travelers may encounter some unusual animals that they have never seen in their own regions.
Pests can contaminate food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, transmit toxins, or spread diseases.

The stretch between the Point Marion and Fairmont dams presents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often bypassed via flat land.
If you are not yet familiar with driving on rural roads, please always focus on the road, especially being mindful of steep roads, narrow roads, and winding roads.
The final speed limit is significantly lower than the preceding and following sections — typically 35-40 mph (56 to 64 km/h) — and strict adherence to this limit is of paramount importance.
But it's really interesting that the mobile phone service is stronger along many other routes, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria, they are diverse and varied, similar to the pastries of their southern neighbors, Austria.

Indonesian cuisine, drawn from a sprawling archipelago of 17,000 islands, is a collective term that encompasses the vast array of regional specialties found throughout the country.
However, if the nuance of the word is not used, it could mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of Java.
Around the entire archipelago, there is an abundance of food. Ji-ff cuisine showcases simple dishes with key ingredients focusing on peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Ji-ff palm sugar), along with various aromatic herbs.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet, suspended on either side of the saddle.
It offers more stability for the rider, but there may be safety concerns because the rider's feet can get caught in it.
If a rider falls off a horse but gets their foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
Initially, most riders wore boots that were heeled and smooth, narrow, and had cushioning.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English ones, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if it is pulled backward by the rider.
Cochamo Valley is Chile's number one hiking destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its many huge and steep granite walls.

Downhill skiing and snowboarding, where you use skis or boards attached to your feet to glide down snow-covered areas, are popular sports.
Skiing is a popular primary travel activity for many, sometimes called a ski bum, and entire vacations are planned around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing has been around for a very long time - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Competitive downhill skiing originated in the 17th century, and in 1861, one of the first recreational ski clubs was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also known as off-piste skiing, ski touring, or alpine touring.
It is related, but usually doesn't involve recreational skiing on high mountains or mountaineering where the latter is skiing on steep terrain and requires rigid and tight skis and boots.
Think of a ski slope as being similar to a hiking trail.
In an ideal situation, you would be able to cover greater distances than walking, but more uniquely, you would achieve the speed of skiing without having to carry a heavy backpack on the trail.
Europe is a small continent, but rich with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would require going through multiple visa applications and passport checks.
However, in this regard, the Schengen area operates as one country.
Generally, if you reside in this area, you can cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen Visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for every Schengen member country, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.

If the country you are visiting becomes a subject of travel advice, your travel health insurance or insurance for cancellation of your trip may be affected.
You may also wish to consult with governments in addition to your own advisors, but their advice is intended only for their own citizens.
For example, Americans in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The travel advisory is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
Often, the views expressed are superficial, generalized, and oversimplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for hazardous weather phenomena that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it comes in different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.

The willingness of foreign governments to accept the documents varies greatly.
Security checkpoint screenings have also become more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not be subjected to scanners that infringe upon their privacy and dignity.
A rip current is a return flow from waves that rebound from the shore and hit a reef or something similar.
Because the underwater topography causes backflows to accumulate in deeper areas, it can create deep currents that flow quickly there.
Most deaths occur because of trying to swim against the current until exhausted, which is impossible.
Swimming back is not difficult if you swim out of the current.
Try to head towards a place where you won't be captured again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you may want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock tends to happen sooner and more intensely than culture shock when going abroad (the initial adjustment phase is shorter), and it can prolong the adjustment period and be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When you return from abroad to your homeland, you will have to adapt to a new culture and will also lose some of your cultural habits from your home country.
When you go abroad for the first time, people there are likely to be patient and understanding of your situation because they know that travelers from foreign countries need to adapt.
People may not have this kind of patience, so understanding and tolerance are necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid temple is one of the most fascinating things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramid temples when the sky is dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you often hear the voices of tourists and business people. The stories about sound and light are like stories in a storybook.

Other islands include Livingston and Deception, where active volcanic calderas provide remarkable natural harbors.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the southern part of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains have merged into a plateau, before re-emerging to form the 360 km Ellsworth mountain range, separated by the Minnesota Glacier.
The north, or the Sentinel Range area, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, namely Vinson Massif, which has a peak elevation of 4892 meters, also known as Mount Vinson.
In remote areas with no cell phone coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for cell phones because you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make calls.
This service is often used through transportation, including recreational crafts as well as missions, which require data and voice.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to these services.
A more popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn something new.
This is an especially popular option for school leavers, allowing them to spend a year outdoors before university without negatively impacting their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year abroad can truly increase your chances of transitioning to higher education in your home country.
Typically, tuition fees are required to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelago and at the lake, you don't need a yacht.
While the archipelago, coastline, and largest lakes are certainly big enough for cruise ships, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Rowing is a national pastime in Finland, where seven or eight people are required to have a boat.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise is unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the figure is from one to forty).
A unique feature of Baltic Sea cruises is the long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a couple of full days visiting the historical city, returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you are only traveling for leisure by cruise ship, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some boat tours feature Berlin, Germany in their promotional brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not a place near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the boat tour.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

Courier companies earn high salaries for delivering goods quickly. Often, time is of the essence with various business documents, goods, or parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, they have problems.
If they shipped the goods by air, through multiple routes, it could take several days to go through cargo handling and customs inspections.
The only way to get through quickly is to have your baggage checked in advance. Aviation regulations do not allow luggage to enter without the passenger, who is required to go through as well.
The most obvious way to travel in First Class or Business Class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for it).
But it's not cheap: unofficially, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal Economy Class ticket price, and up to eleven times the First Class fare!
Generally speaking, there's no reason to look for discounts on first class or business class seats for a direct flight from A to B without layovers.
Airlines are well aware that there is a specific core group of flyers who are willing to spend their money for the privilege of getting somewhere faster and more comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

Light pollution during their holidays is not the same as the problem that exists today. Those problems are mostly found in cities or near school grounds, which are easier to access than the construction sites being built now.
The most modern research telescopes are enormous instruments located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
