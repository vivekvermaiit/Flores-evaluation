As a now widespread theory, this not only proves that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional graphics.
Scientists stated that the underside of this animal's fur is pale or cream-colored, while the upper side appears chestnut-brown.
This discovery also gives an idea about the evolution of bird feathers.
Due to the absence of a well-developed central rachis in the dinosaur's feathers, but the presence of other features such as barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the central rachis was a result of the subsequent evolutionary development of these other features.
From the shape of the feathers, it could be estimated that they were intended not for the creature's flight, but more for regulating body temperature or for appearance. During the research, it was speculated that although the feathers belonged to the tail of a young dinosaur, they resembled an adult feather rather than that of a hatchling.
Despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers reported that the feathers were like those of an adult creature.

They discovered that the same fundamental principles pertaining to other stars also exist in the sun, thus it was determined that the movement of all stars is related to their brightness and rotation and originates from nothing else.
Luminosity and turnover are used together to determine the Rossby number associated with the star's plasma flow.
The activity of a star in terms of magnetic field reversal depends on the Rossby number. The smaller the Rossby number, the less activity there will be.

Although the work carried out was theoretical, a program was also written for the purpose of modeling observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
Tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way may have caused the effect the team was looking for.
Just as the Moon pulls on planet Earth, creating tides, the Milky Way also exerts pressure in the direction of the Sagittarius constellation.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dark matter's effect on other matter is similar to the effect that ordinary matter exhibits.
The theory claims that a very dark matter resides in the form of a halo made up of many small particles around the galaxy.

In the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, a highly drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by physician Tony Moll.
In an interview, he stated that the new form of the disease was "extremely worrying and dangerous due to its very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, and that at least two of them are medical staff at the hospital.
An infected person can infect 10-15 people who have been in close contact with them within a year.
However, among people infected with tuberculosis, the percentage of those infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis remains low, meaning that in South Africa, out of a total of 330,000 infected people at any given time, 6,000 have it.

The diameter of all entrances to the cave known as "Seven Sisters" measures a minimum of 100-250 meters (between 328-820 feet).
Infrared images suggest that they resemble caves due to the day-night temperature difference.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface, while at night they are warmer.
According to Glen Cushing of the US Geological Survey's Astrogeology Science Center and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, "their thermal activity is not as stable as that in large caves, which often support fairly constant temperatures on Earth, but that's related to having those deep holes in the ground."
The voting process in France has typically been a low-tech affair; people participating in the election would enter a booth, mark their chosen candidate on a ballot pre-printed with the candidates' names, and place the ballot in an envelope.
After verifying the voter's identity, officials allow the voter to place the envelope containing the ballot in the ballot box and sign the voter list.
In France, the election process is fully regulated by electoral laws.
After 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that both voters and observers can see that the box is empty when voting begins and that no additional envelopes are placed in the box other than the legal ballots that are properly counted.
Candidates may appoint their representatives to observe each stage of the procedure. All collected votes are counted in the evening by volunteer staff, following certain procedures and under observation.

According to the bill, violent video games sold in the State of California will be labeled with a label designed so that the number "18" can be read, and the sale of such games to minors will result in a fine of $1000 for each such offense.
This morning, the Head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Ker Starmer QC, stated in a statement that both Hyun and Price have been prosecuted.
After Hyun resigned, MP Ed Davey will take his place in the Cabinet. MP Norman Lamb is expected to succeed Davey as Business Secretary, a position that will be vacant after Davey's departure.
Hyun and his ex-wife Price's trial is scheduled to take place on February 16th at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Those who lost their lives were 25-year-old Nikolas Alden and 21-year-old driver Zakari Kyudbek.
Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider's face will need to be reconstructed with surgery.
Ukah's gun malfunctioned as it was aiming at the fifth man's head. Schneider's pain continued, he had blindness in one eye, a missing piece in his skull, and possessed a face made of titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a U.S. HQ base in his homeland.
Besides the event that took place on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in two separate races within the championship.
He received a "Did Not Finish" result in his first competition, which was in slalom. 36 out of 116 players had the same result in the competition.
She finished the race in tenth place in the women's giant slalom sitting ski competition with a total race time of 4:41:30, which was 2:11:60 slower than the first-place winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 slower than the ninth-place finisher, Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
In the women's sitting ski competition group, four skiers were unable to finish the race, and in the Giant Slalom competition, 45 out of a total of 117 skiers were unable to achieve a ranking.
Madhya Pradesh Police returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone to its owner.
According to Deputy Inspector General D K Arya, they have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and recovered the woman's mobile phone and laptop.
The names of the defendants were Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the convict was brought to court with his face covered.
None of the three people in the house were injured when the car crashed into the house.
Nevertheless, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
While emergency medical personnel were extracting the driver from the red Audi TT, the accident site was temporarily closed to traffic.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
The Addenbrooke's Hospital, where he was later transferred, was in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya, who was tried in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, is accused of killing his son.
He will remain in custody until the indictment is brought and the trial begins. However, any witness testimony may not be legally valid because his pictures have been widely published in the press.
While this is an experience frequently encountered in other parts of the United Kingdom, Scottish justice is distinct, and courts consider the publication of images as a potentially damaging step.
"Journalists are treading dangerous waters when they disseminate suspects' photos and other information about them," said University of Dundee Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Royal District, responsible for all court investigations, stated that it would not provide any comments to journalists until at least the indictment is known.
According to the spreading news, that document will refer to the border dispute. In this dispute, Palestine wants the borders to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Among other issues covered, the future status of Jerusalem, considered sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue were also present.
Israel demands that its military forces remain permanently in the valley for ten years from the moment the agreement is signed. The Palestinian National Authority, however, agrees to these forces being stationed here for only five years.
Forest rangers will closely monitor the shooters participating in the additional verification test for pest control, as the test will be checked and its impact assessed.
Volunteers with sufficient proficiency were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's shooting program in partnership with NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service) and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Loane, the Deputy Director of Park Conservation and Material Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four individuals selected for the initial cull operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, the swearing-in ceremony of Martelli took place before the new Provisional Election Commission (PEC) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential administration's commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEC (Central Election Commission) as part of a package of measures taken to prepare the country for the upcoming elections.
The government responded to the anti-regime protesters, which began in October and spread widely, with the Martelli commission.
Violent protests were also sparked in some cases by the refusal to hold certain elections that were supposed to take place after 2011.
Approximately 60 malfunction cases have been reported regarding iPods overheating excessively, including a total of six fire incidents, with reports indicating that four people suffered minor physical injuries as a result.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry reported that 27 accidents involving the devices are known.
Last week, METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) reported that it had received an additional 34 complaints from Apple regarding excessive overheating and that the company considered these to be "minor cases."
The ministry assessed Apple's delaying of the report as an "unwelcome" situation.
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage has been reported in the country.
Additionally, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that no tsunami signs had been observed.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
So far, it has been confirmed that several hostages have been rescued and at least 6 people are dead.
6 centuries were released freely, including children and the elderly, like Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers had taken the place of the elderly woman who needed the restroom. Mendoza was neutralized by being shot.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began working in the healthcare sector.
After completing her midwifery education, she worked at Auckland State Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the Liggins Hospital, she began to learn about premature births in her spare time.
His research showed that the process of fetal lung formation accelerates if hormones are administered.
Xinhua reported that state investigators were able to recover the two "black boxes" that record flight data from the plane on Wednesday.
Other wrestler friends also commemorated Luna.
"Luna Extreme was the first Queen. She was my first manager. She died on a night when there were two moons. Her death was as unique as she was. She was a strong woman," Tommy Dreamer added.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as unusual as me... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
In the 2010 federal election, the number of people who participated in pre-election surveys and opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
According to a survey, 34 percent of respondents wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
Based on the final results of the survey, 29% of participants believe that Australia will become a republic, while 31% believe it will never achieve this.
The Olympic gold medalist in freestyle swimming was supposed to swim from 100 meters to 200 meters and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but considering his complaints, they suspected his health was questionable.
He can't use pain medication because it's banned in the games.
The largest number known to date was discovered on January 25th by Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri.
This discovery, confirmed by several people using different devices and software by the beginning of February, was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are believed to be a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic materials that could create proteins and support life.
Scientists are trying to understand how the planet Earth was formed, as planets, especially comets, collided with the Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo, who began serving as governor at the beginning of this year, passed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called all these rumors "political blather and foolishness".
There are rumors that he will put forward his candidacy in the 2016 presidential elections.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system will save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions by allowing aircraft to fly shorter routes.
For this, instead of old, ground-based radar technology, satellite-based technology is used, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of the aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional vehicles are allowed to stop, overground trains will continue non-stop through Wembley, and there will be no roadside parking, parks, or transit vehicles.
The fear of lack of transportation increased the possibility of the match being played in a closed arena, without team fans.
The journal "Science" published a new study on Thursday about the emergence of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States reported that new species are secularized in just two generations, but this process is thought to take longer than the formation of a captive-bred endemic "Darwin's finch," "Geospiza difficilis," migratory cactus finches, and "Geospiza magnirostris."
Gold can be formed into any shape. It can be rolled into a small ball.
It can be drawn into a thin, flexible wire. It can be hammered and rolled into sheets.
It can be prepared very thinly and adhered to other metals, even so thinly that it can be used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books, sometimes called "illuminated manuscripts."
These chemical substances are called pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether a chemical substance is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level in the analyzed chemical substances is determined by the amount of Hydrogen (H in pH) ions they contain.
Protons stripped of their electrons are considered hydrogen ions because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron.
After mixing the two dry powders together, slightly dampen your hands and form a ball from this mixture.
The dampness of your hands will affect the outer layers, which can cause a tingling sensation and a kind of crust to form on your hands.
Flushing toilets connected to a complex sewage system are a characteristic feature of almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women went together, in mixed company.
You can call someone thousands of miles away from you via satellite.
The satellite, once it receives a signal sent from space, immediately reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and images, scientists use telescopes in space.
A satellite or telescope can only be put into space with a large rocket that is 100 feet long.
The greatest achievement that the wheel, which significantly changed the world, has brought us is easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to this invention, we gained trains, automobiles, as well as many other modes of transportation.
Beneath them are larger cats that prey on medium-sized animals like rabbits, antelopes, and gazelles.
Finally, small cats (including comfortable house cats) have a large number of prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in a niche concept based on the saying that every cat with its own unique job is unrivaled.
Lions are the most social felines, living in groups called prides.
Prides consist of up to thirty female lions and cubs, as well as 1-3 mature male lions.
Lionesses are usually very close to each other, living as a large family composed of daughters and sisters.
Lion prides behave like wolf or dog packs, resembling each other surprisingly in their behavior (unlike other big cats), and are deadly hunters for their prey.
The tiger possesses abilities like a highly flexible athlete, being able to climb (moderately well), swim, leap long distances, and carry loads up to 5 times greater than a strong human.
Tigers (from the Panthera genus) are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four animals are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar doesn't resemble a sweet, rumbling growl; it sounds more like raspy and jingling words.
Ocelots feed on small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are smaller than them.
According to scientists, ocelots find and track their prey (animals) by smelling the area where they are.
Ocelots have excellent night vision, allowing them to see very well in the dark, and they also move stealthily, blending in with their surroundings to hunt their prey at the first opportunity.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the population to which they belong and ends up in a place different from the environment they previously inhabited (for example, if they are taken to the other side of a mountain or river, or to a new island, they cannot easily return).
This new environment has diverse resources and various competitors, so the new population will require different characteristics and adaptations to become a stronger competitor compared to its previous form.
The initial form of the population actually didn't change at all; they still need the same adaptation as before.
As the newly settled population gradually began to adapt to the environment, they became less like others.
As a result, after thousands or even millions of years, two living species may look so different from today that they might not even be classified in the same genus.
We call this process the process of speciation, meaning it involves the formation of new species. This process is an inevitable consequence and a very important component of the evolutionary process.
Plants produce oxygen, which is essential for human respiration, and absorb the carbon dioxide they release.
Plants grow by photosynthesizing with the help of the sun. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our houses and sew our clothes, and most of the food we eat is made up of plants. Animals could not live without plants.
Because Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, it feared nothing except other mosasaurs, its own relatives.
In its long jaws were over 70 sharp teeth, with an extra set in the upper palate, which meant that nothing alive could escape its grasp.
While we don't have precise information, we believe it had a forked tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it's even possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water, and even a huge dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't compete with him.
While we recognize most of their foods, the Romans had distinct banquet dishes such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and dormice, which is a type of rodent.
Another difference was that while the poor and a woman ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich people held feasts together and ate their meals reclining on their sides, relaxing.
In the following centuries, dishes coming from America or Asia to Europe were not part of ancient Roman cuisine.
So they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, and no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The people of Babylon built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be that god's home.
While priests tried to satisfy the gods' demands with ceremonies and festivals, people also offered sacrifices to their gods.
Each of the temples has a dome and an altar that only priests can enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-like towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The tower's highest point was intended solely for worshipping God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
Living in the open air was often a way of life for Hebrew families.
The women prepared food in their courtyards, and the shops consisted only of open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forest areas, so wood products were extremely expensive.
In Greenland, the population is sparsely distributed. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red, exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, sailed westward and discovered Greenland, naming it so.
However, Eskimo tribes were already living there, regardless of its discovery at that time.
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are "Scandinavian" countries, but there are many differences between their peoples, kings, customs, and history.
If you think the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map written on the back, you've watched "National Treasure".
However, this is not true. What is written on the back of the document is not a map leading to treasure.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence document, at the bottom, upside down, are the words "Original of the Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although it is unknown who wrote this document (measuring 24½ inches in length and 29¾ inches in width), which consists of a large parchment paper folded for preservation, it is known that he wrote it early in his life.
Thus, the notation was probably added simply as a label.
Although the Normandy landings and ongoing battles cleared the northern part of France from enemy occupation, the southern part was still deprived of freedom.
It was governed by the French, known as "Vichy." This French population, which signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940, collaborated instead of fighting against the occupiers.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion plan was called "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces liberated the south of France in just two weeks and then headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a unified culture where a large group of people living and working together share a society.
The word "civilization" derives from the Latin word "civilis," meaning "civil," and also from the Latin word "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," while also defining the scope of a society in a certain form.
The predecessors of nations were city-states. Civilization understands culture as the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the preservation of cultural traces, and fair dissemination.
Small cultures are often not recognized as civilizations because they disappear without leaving behind unique historical evidence.
As stipulated in the Articles of Confederation, the Revolutionary War was still ongoing when the thirteen states united and formed a weak central government whose sole component was Congress.
Lacking the power to levy taxes, the congress relied on state bodies that were not very effective in implementing all the laws, as there was no national executive or judicial authority.
Furthermore, it does not have the authority to invalidate interstate tax legislation and tariffs.
Before changes can be applied to the articles, anonymous consent must be obtained from all states, but the states were so indifferent to the central government that the representatives representing them often missed meetings.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world, and they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing are among the popular sports.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions of the country. Italians also participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
The Japanese possess approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the world's 7th largest island nation.
Due to its cluster and group of islands, Japan is also geographically called an "archipelago".
In the 15th century, after European sailors recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa," or "beautiful island," Taiwan began its era of being known by those names.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, revolutionizing local grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), which seized the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, confirming the transfer of sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control of it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consisted of 3 main monuments: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Reconstruction work was applied to many of the buildings surrounding the complex with the aim of creating an impression in tourists of how the originals actually looked.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored, and reconstruction work is still ongoing.
For example, we can say that the most widespread photography format in the world is still 35 mm film, which was considered the most commonly used film size at the end of the analog film era.
Currently, it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is applied in digital camera image sensor formats.
Although the 35mm format might sound a bit confusing, it actually means 36mm width and 24mm height.
Therefore, it is reported that the ratio of that format between the parties is 3:2 (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number).
Many common formats (formats belonging to the APS family can be cited as an example) equal or approximate this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often exploited and in most cases mocked, is a simple rule that creates dynamism by preserving a certain sequence stage of a picture.
It notes that the most effective spot for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
The transfer of the strengthened and enriched Catholic Church under state control occurred during this period of European history.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has connected European countries, despite the diversity in their religions, languages, and traditions.
His all-encompassing power took everyone under its influence, from the king to his people.
One of the main principles of Christianity was that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial fund established in the church should serve only this purpose.
For millennia, the central authority of the Church was located in Rome, and this concentration of power and financial resources in one place raised questions among people about whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Soon after England began military operations, it blockaded Germany by sea.
Although this blockade violated generally accepted norms of international law, regulated by several international agreements of the past two centuries, the strategy exerted its influence by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies.
To prevent any ship from accessing all parts of the ocean, Britain did not hesitate to endanger even ordinary ships and mined international waters.
Because the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the main attitude of many citizens and peoples consisted of pacifism and isolation.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations would never wish to face such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offered to him at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States of America, he had only 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) with him.
Ancient China displayed different time zones in a unique way. Each stage of China, or each ruling family, was its own dynasty.
Also, among the kingdoms, the fragmented provinces had different periods. The best known of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years with conflicts between the Han and Jin kingdoms.
During these periods, fierce battles broke out among the nobles vying for the throne.
This Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in their struggle to sit on the highest throne in a magnificent palace located in Xi'an.
Existing social and political influences include the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and beliefs that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, professions were open to all male candidates who were the most ambitious and ready to succeed.
The same could be said for the army, because army rank was determined by caliber, not by class.
The French Revolution inspired the working class, who were subjected to repression in other countries, to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad showed a deep interest in topics that were not related to worldly matters. He would frequently come to a cave called "Hira" in the Nur mountain to contemplate.
Within the cave that has stood the test of time, an extraordinarily clear impression emerges, linked to the spiritual allure of the Prophet Muhammad.
Completely isolated from the rest of the world, this cave is located on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca.
Actually, although its existence is known, finding it is difficult. Entering the cave means being completely isolated.
Looking up, one can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the mountains surrounding it. It is very difficult to sense the world from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is just one of the seven wonders that have survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many great pyramids built to immortalize the memory of the deceased Pharaoh.
As Europe emerged from the Middle Ages, the combination of the Chorales of the Roman Catholic community (later called Gregorian chants) and liturgical rites led to the development of a type of music that later spread throughout Europe through the papacy and monasteries for both women and men to sing.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while the surrounding smaller pyramids, most of the tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "caron" mark resembles the letter V, while the "ogonek" mark resembles a pincer or a square with the bottom side missing.
When we say "up," you should draw the bow from top to bottom, and when we say "down," you should draw the bow towards yourself, starting from the side of the violin where you hold the bow.
The upper string usually produces softer sounds, while the lower string produces stronger and more decisive sounds.
Don't hesitate to make your own markings with a pencil, but the bowing marks printed in the music indicate a specific detail, so they must be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a crowd created by market women.
They returned to Paris in a wagon, amidst a group of people who were glaring at the king and queen, shouting their hatred and threatening them.
Due to the large crowd of people, the King and Queen had to open the car windows all the way.
At that moment, a person from the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the panicked Queen.
The war expenses incurred during the US imperialist occupation of the Philippines were extracted from the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and fluctuating bond interest rates on behalf of the Philippine government through branches of Wall Street banks.
Undoubtedly, a sufficiently large profit, which would constitute a major gain for US imperialism, was derived from the long-standing exploitation of the Filipino people.
Understanding the Templars requires grasping the context that spurred their creation.
The 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, during which these events occurred, are known in European history as the Early Middle Ages (CE 1000-1300).
After the early Middle Ages, the late Middle Ages followed, lasting 1500 years.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas, from the endeavor or necessity of technological development, to a firm belief that human destiny is guided by the fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most commentaries pertaining to technological determinism rest on two common ideas: that technological development, on its own, progresses on a grand scale further than cultural or political influence, and that technology, rather than being socially conditioned, inherently exerts an "impact" on society.
For example, we can say that motor vehicles play a leading role in the development of roads.
Despite all this, a nationwide transport network is only economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being created that can reduce the costs of car ownership.
The majority of the population owning cars leads not only to an increase in road accidents, but also to the invention of new technologies in the healthcare sector to treat those physically injured in accidents.
Romanticism possesses a strong element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Connected to romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and as time progressed, customs and cultures aligned with that geography arose, forming a harmony with society, which was better than arbitrarily defined laws.
Considering Paris is the fashion center of the modern world, Constantinople was also considered the fashion center of feudal Europe.
It began to be recognized as a center of luxury around the 400th year of our era and retained this status until the 1100th year of our era.
Beginning in the twelfth century, it gradually began to lose its status, primarily due to the fact that the crusaders returned with items more valuable than goods like silk and spices found in Byzantine markets.
It was precisely at this time that Constantinople's title of "Fashion Capital" was transferred to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture of the East influenced clothing.
However, due to weak communication channels, Western styles were 25-30 years behind.
Western Europe began to refine its lifestyle in the late Middle Ages. One of the greatest innovations of the era was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes as a result of the Crusades.
A family farm is a type of farm that produces enough products to meet the food needs of the farmer and his family.
A family-peasant farm is a system that uses a simpler technique to increase yields or organically appropriate seed stock preserved to suit the ecoregion along with easy, organic, and rotational cropping.
Historically, many farmers engaged in family farming, and this is still the case in most developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel alienated from mainstream social standards, allowing them to forge a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender affiliation of members are factors that differentiate subcultures.
Aspects that distinctly classify a subculture can be assessed as language, aesthetics, religion, political, sexual, geographical factors, or a combination thereof.
Members of a subculture typically demonstrate their membership through characteristic and symbolic use of style, often encompassing fashion, behaviors, and the use of slang.
Referring to a few of the tragic life stories of children who were raised neglected, unhappily, or exploited, and who were not introduced to social life by adults while growing up, is one of the most common methods used to express the importance of socialization.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some of these feral children are confined to the home by people (usually their own parents), while in some cases, parents abandon the child because they reject the child's severe mental or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have been subjected to child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping from someone.
Other children are claimed to have been raised by animals, with some allegedly living spontaneously in the wild.
A completely unsocialized feral child, raised by animals, will demonstrate fear or indifference towards humans, almost always mimicking the actions of the animal that raised them (within physical limitations).
While the learning process focuses on making project-based learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method takes it to entirely new levels.
The temporary setup is more of a tool for students who use new learning methods, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project, rather than a teaching method.
Temporary fixtures are virtual and real, meaning that a teacher is a temporary fixture, but so is the little pin man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual temporary devices are embedded in the software and designed for students to ask questions related to procedures they may have difficulty with, get quick answers, and understand the procedures.
Children are placed in foster families for various reasons, such as neglect, mistreatment, and even violence.
Although no child should grow up in an environment devoid of those who nurture, care for, train, and educate them, they do.
We consider the Foster Care System to be a safe zone for those children.
Ensuring a safe home, a caring caregiver, stable education, and reliable healthcare is essential in the foster family system.
All the unmet needs of the children in the home they left should be met in the foster family.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The various features of the internet lead to added value in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important types of motivation for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eimi and McCord (1998), investigating the public's attitude towards websites, determined that "individual participation" and "ongoing relationships" are new motivating factors.
The use of video recordings, micro-expressions lasting only a few milliseconds, led to significant findings in the interpretation of facial movements.
It was claimed that one could tell if someone was lying, especially by interpreting micro-expressions appropriately.
In his article titled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks discusses how people with brain trauma, even if they don't understand the speech, can accurately assess the speaker's sincerity.
He had claimed that even some animals, such as domestic dogs, possess this ability, which consists of interpreting human behavior.
Twentieth-century research showed that genetic diversity has two bases: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic diversity, while selection removes it from the expressed variants.
Parting and reunification shuffle variations back and forth between two groups from each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the plants available there.
Even being unable to do this can lead to serious consequences such as growth depression, poor nutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources may be protein derived from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult-to-digest foods, even for primates like us, unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides the body with a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids it needs.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the same way chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of having interrupted sleep, waking up suddenly while sleeping, and falling back asleep again within a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily implemented by using a relatively quieter alarm clock, just to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you usually turn off your alarm sleepily and go back to sleep when it rings, try putting it far away from your bed so you're forced to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices include consuming excessive fluids before bed (especially water or tea, or a known diuretic) and the method of frequent urination.
A person's level of inner peace is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and soul.
Where tension is low, the love of life is that much greater. The desire to attain complete peace and contentment is inherent in every person.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and pessimism.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but has become more comprehensive with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and Tibetan Buddhism, which consists of the path of love, is fundamentally very simple.
Kundalini energy (clarity of thought) is awakened through Kundalini Yoga, with yoga practices such as breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Deity Yoga lies at the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through visualizations of various celestial beings for the purification of energy channels and the activation of chakras, the consciousness of enlightenment is awakened.
Germany, being a common enemy, was the reason for the USSR and the USA to act together in World War II. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the separation of the countries from each other.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
The Cold War continued for the next 40 years with real proxy "armies" in all the battle zones from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, after the defense of Poland was breached, retreating and reorganizing under the protection of Romania was the only remaining hope.
Nevertheless, these plans lost their force overnight after 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, invaded the eastern regions of Poland and then entered Belarus and Ukraine, creating fronts there.
The most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans was to use cargo ships.
Traditionally, the job of navies has been to protect your country's ability to transport its own people and goods, while also interfering with the enemy's ability to transport their own people and goods.
The North Atlantic operation of World War II is one of the most notable examples of this in recent times. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to Britain to help them.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to prevent this movement, mainly using U-boats.
Germany could only conquer England as it had the rest of Europe if the Allies had been defeated in that struggle.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
To easily obtain their milk, wool, meat, and hide, tribes in ancient cultures began to keep them.
Usually, goatherds, who look more like shepherds but are usually children and teenagers, look after domestic goats that join herds grazing on hills or other pasture areas. These herding methods are still used today.
Roads were built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the wagon roads consisted only of wooden supports parallel to each other, they allowed horses to pull them along with heavy loads to increase their speed on more difficult roads.
Sleepers were introduced quickly enough to hold the sections of the railway line in place. Still, as time passed, it was thought that these roads would be more advantageous if there was iron on top of those rails as well.
It started to be used as a widespread application, but iron-bottomed wagons with wooden wheels wore out more quickly.
As time passed, wooden wheels were replaced with steel wheels, and the first all-steel rails were introduced to the market in 1767.
Humans began walking two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man), making pedestrian travel the first mode of transportation known to us.
The habit of walking upright did not exist in the ancestors, the Australopithecus.
Bipedalism traits were discovered in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago; however, it should be considered that Sahelanthropus may have also been able to walk on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can take the first step by showing a more friendly attitude towards nature, joining environmental protection movements, and even becoming activists to prevent, to some extent, future damage that may be inflicted on nature.
In most cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want to solve problems temporarily, we must identify and neutralize their root cause.
It is clear that the scientific and technological advancements in humanity have transformed the world into a different place, and the large population size coupled with people's interest in an extravagant lifestyle has led to a further increase in problems.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the manuscript of the law, signed by John Hancock, President of the Congress, and Charles Thomson, Secretary, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a few buildings away.
In one night, 150-200 copies of the document, known as "Dunlap broadsides," were produced.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall.
George Washington read the copy sent to him on July 6th to his troops in New York City on July 9th. Another copy reached London on August 10th.
As we know, Dunlap's 25 posters that have survived to this day are the oldest copies of the document that have reached us. The original handwritten copy, however, does not exist.
In the modern world, most paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
The reason many people don't accept them as dinosaurs is because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many aspects that resemble dinosaurs.
These birds, which have scaly skin and clawed feet, can lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
The manipulation of data encoded with binary numbers forms the operating principle of almost all computers used today.
A binary digit has only one of two values, that is, either 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits or bits in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not manifest itself immediately. Because symptoms like vomiting are very common, it's not always possible to make an accurate diagnosis.
The open container of a medicinal drug or the presence of toxic household chemicals are the best indicators of internal poisoning.
Read the brochure that notes the emergency medical instructions for this particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "beetle" in a general sense for insects belonging to this group.
This term arose because we have been familiar with bedbugs, which have the ability to live as parasites in the human body, since ancient times.
Both blood-sucking insects and bedbugs are dangerous, they are able to live in the nest or in the home of the organism they inhabit.
In the US, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), indicating that it is primarily observed as a major neurological disease in young and middle-aged patients.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple might think that raising a child is against their own interests or the interests of their children.
These couples can make a plan to adopt a baby.
In the adoption process, the child's biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another family can become their parents.
The main goal of science is to investigate how the world works using scientific methods. In fact, this method leads many scientific researches.
However, in reality, this is not just an experiment; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations are also part of scientific research.
Natural and philosophical scientists studied classical texts, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were used in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As the level of mastery of the Greek language decreased, the West gradually began to separate from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Rhythms, which mainly depend on the existence of endogenous periods and their generation through the biological clock, are more frequently encountered in physiology and behavior.
Intrinsic rhythms not solely created by reaction to external periodic signals are structured for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are oscillators that can continue to cycle freely and self-regulate, even without external influences.
That DNA is genetic material was one of the main ideas put forward based on the Hershey-Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They labeled the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus and the proteins of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur in order to conduct two experiments.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a germ cell or not.
Mutations that can be passed on to children only when present in germ cells can cause cell death or cancer when present elsewhere.
Tourism trips organized in the lap of nature attract more attention from people interested in visiting natural places to enjoy the scenery, including plants, animals, and wildlife.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and walking in parks, as well as learning about ecosystems, can be examples of on-site activities.

Every morning, people get into their cars and leave their small towns to go to work, while others who have workplaces where they came from pass them by, heading in the opposite direction.
In this dynamic route scheme, everyone is connected to and supports a system that relies on personal vehicles in one way or another.
Science shows that the mass carbon economy has driven the biosphere out of the stable state that supported human evolution for the past two years.
Almost everyone who is a member of society and uses public transport also complains about public transport.
You rarely hear complaints with similar content, such as water quality or a bridge collapsing, in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they experience problems every day? Are transport vehicle engineers incompetent? Or are there more fundamental things happening?
Road traffic is the analysis of the movement of vehicles between two points and the interactive relationship they create with each other, as well as the behavior of drivers individually.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study road traffic because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers generally demonstrate reasonably logical behavior, so traffic flows usually fit into a certain logical framework and can even be represented approximately mathematically.
To better express traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relations help with the planning, design, and implementation of highways.
The ability to fly, which insects, the first animals to take to the skies, possessed, allowed them to easily escape predators, find food, and mate more efficiently.
Many insects have the ability to fold their wings over their backs.
These features give them a wide range of small places where they can protect themselves from predators.
Currently, there are only two insects that cannot fold their wings on their backs, one of which is the dragonfly, and the other is the mayfly.
A man named Aristarchus stated thousands of years ago that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Although some thought he was right, the majority of people believed the opposite, that is, that the Solar System, including the Sun itself (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
Because the Earth's movement isn't felt, this idea seems logical, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the largest river in the world by discharge volume of water, and the second longest river. Its water volume is 8 times greater than the second largest river.
The Amazon River, the largest river on Earth, is 6 miles wide in some places.
20% of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River, which collects water from thousands of small rivers, is 6387 km (3980 miles) long.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were unrivaled in terms of their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The Vatican has approximately 800 residents. It is considered the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
Italian is the language of law and official communication in the Vatican.
Italian is the language used daily by most of those working in the province, while Latin is typically used in religious ceremonies.
Roman Catholics are citizens of the Vatican.
People have been aware of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they are found in nature in their natural form and can be extracted relatively easily with primitive tools.
According to Aristotle's theory, everything is made up of one or more of the four elements. These elements were air, water, fire, and earth.
This is more akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he assumed that those substances were being transformed into new substances to form what we wanted to see.
Alloys are mainly formed from a mixture of two or more metals. Let's not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table of chemical elements.
Chemical elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It is also possible to obtain alloys that contain non-metal elements such as carbon in small amounts.
Matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms, makes up everything in the universe.
Atoms are so small that if trillions of them combined, they would only be the size of a period at the end of this sentence.
Since its invention, the pencil has become a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods are discovered, the use of pens has decreased even further.
People now type their messages on computer screens, while pencil sharpeners are gradually becoming a thing of the past.
In this case, we are only left to guess what a keyboard will be good for after a new invention.
The working principle of a nuclear bomb is based on the energy required to bind together a nucleus containing numerous protons and neutrons.
This is like driving a heavily loaded cart uphill. When the nucleus is split again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have a very strong tendency to decay with very little or no stimulus because they have an unstable nucleus.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It appears thinner under the dark layers called "maria", and thicker under the mountainous regions.
There may be more lunar maria on the side of the Moon facing Earth because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for basaltic lavas to reach the surface.
The main goal of content theories is to determine what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that they harbor within themselves as they grow and mature.
These theories explore what motivates certain people to act the way they do, and what, in their environment, compels them to perform certain actions or refrain from them.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two popular theories from the group of motivation theories.
Generally, two types of behavior can manifest when managers start managing their former colleagues. One end of this spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Such leaders struggle with making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, evaluating the quality of work, assigning tasks, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of this spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks they have to change everything a group has done and redo everything themselves.
As a result, he bears full responsibility for whether or not the leading team succeeds.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are considered equal to traditional teams in terms of the same quality standards, with very subtle differences.
Virtual team members are often used as a point of contact for physical teams close to them.
Because their teams may meet across different time zones that aren't apparent to the local management system, they have more independence than a traditional team member.
One of the indispensable parts of a virtual team is the existence of the true "invisible team" factor (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
"Invisible Team" is a management group that sets standards for team members, with each member reporting to it.
Why would a company want to go to great lengths to earn the title of a learning company? Because the sole purpose of applying in-house learning concepts in practice is innovation.
Creativity and mastery can emerge if all available resources are used effectively across an organization's functional departments.
Ultimately, an organizational process acting collaboratively to overcome an obstacle can play a leading role in new innovations that will meet customer needs.
For an enterprise to be innovative, the management must foster a culture of innovation along with knowledge sharing and an internal learning culture.
Angel (2006) explains that the Whole Environment approach is used as a method to help companies elevate their work to a higher level.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying knowledge, and for this reason, it narrows the field of research, bringing it into a more precise form.
Research by scientists confirms the connection between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various brain traumas, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect human movements and cause changes in certain mental functions.
With the development of new technologies, it is possible to observe and study previously unseen forms and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to create simulation templates that make it easier for us to understand the stages in our thinking.
While artificial intelligence strongly evokes science fiction, it represents a very significant branch of computer science related to machine behavior, learning, and the adaptation of intellect.
AI research is about creating techniques for the automatic execution of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include handwriting, voice, and facial recognition, as well as skills in sampling, testing, planning and programming, and responding to customer diagnoses and questions.
Such topics have brought about various disciplines that deal with solving problems encountered in real life.
AI systems are frequently used in the economy, medicine, engineering, and military fields, in addition to the IT system, because they are installed in several home computers and software suitable for video games.
Field trips are a major part of any curriculum. In many cases, teachers like to take their students on excursions to places that are not accessible by bus.
Thanks to the virtual travel solution offered by technology, students will be able to sit in the classroom and view museum exhibits, watch aquariums, or admire amazing works of art.
Sharing any school trip virtually is a great way to reflect on that trip and share our experiences in future lessons.
Because a new model is created each year, the website that the students of Bennett School in North Carolina created about their trip to the state capital is preserved as an album, with the old version being kept.
Blogs are effective for improving students' writing skills. Although students typically begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling skills, having an audience changes this situation.
Since students usually constitute the most critical audience, the author of the blog strives to further improve the writing to avoid being subjected to criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "encourages students to gather more information about the world around them." The desire to attract the reader's attention inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging fosters a spirit of collaboration among students and encourages them to expand their knowledge beyond what they learn at school.
Students can strengthen their analytical and critical skills by making appropriate "use" of blogs; they can frequently refer to internet materials and formulate a position based on the writings of others, as well as define their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's bilingual, enchanting capital, showcases its past and present through its many art galleries and museums.
To the south ahead lies Niagara Falls, while to the north reside Muskoka and other undiscovered natural beauties.
All of this and more allows Ontario to be truly valued by foreigners as authentic Canada.
Across the vast territories starting from the north, the population is sparsely settled, and some places are almost untouched by humans.
The population comparison surprises many, as there are more African Americans residing in the USA than Canadian citizens.
In the Indian Ocean, in the part adjacent to the east coast of Africa, there are islands of East Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is undoubtedly one of the largest and like a continent on its own.
Many of the relatively smaller islands are independent nations or dependent on France and are popular as luxurious coastal resorts.
The religion of Islam, brought to these lands by the Arabs, spread as far as the Comoro Islands and Mayotte.
The expansion of Europe's sphere of influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery of the sea route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Regardless of their actual marital status, all female travelers are advised to state that they are married.
Wearing a ring might also help (just as long as it's not too expensive).
Women should consider that cultural differences can result in what they call assault, and that it is not at all similar to behaviors like robbery, armed harassment, and so on.
When rejecting men, be firm and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether there are cultural differences or not, this is unacceptable!).
Founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, the modern city of Casablanca was called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, and used as a strategic port city.
The Portuguese abandoned the rebuilt Casa Branca after the earthquake of 1755.
Spanish merchants who established trading posts in the city called it Casablanca, but the Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Dar el-Beida.
Casablanca is one of the most attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the ancient medina, it's very easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various types of decorative items, but all of it is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located at the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which affected many of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is extremely reliable, visits to other locations outside of Goma should be explored in order to understand the situation of the ongoing war in North Kivu province.
The city is also considered a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, one of the cheapest ways to observe Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for a short distance taxi ride is ~500 Congolese Francs.
The word "Timbuktu," with its perceived inaccessibility, had also begun to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Although Timbuktu has become a tourist attraction due to its popularity today, and even has an airport, it is considered a poor city.
Due to the danger posed by the desert sands, it was added to the World Heritage List as a monument at risk in 1990.
This was one of the most significant stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS program related to his exclusive Africa's Great Civilizations.
This city, where one feels the Arab spirit more strongly than the African, stands in complete contrast to the other cities of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while its southern border is bordered by the Crocodile River.
The park's total area is 19,500 km², and it is divided into 14 different eco-regions, each harboring its own unique wildlife.
Besides being one of South Africa's top attractions, it is also considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Daily conservation and entrance fees are required here as in all South African National Parks.
In addition, it may be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to selected parks in South Africa, or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island has also given its name to the area where it is located, and this area is a major center attracting tourists.
One can compare Hong Kong's skyline, formed by the arrangement of buildings, to a captivating, shimmering histogram emerging from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon shore.
Much of the urbanization of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along its densely populated northern shore.
This is the place the British colonists appropriated, so if you are looking for evidence related to the colonial history of the region, you can start here.
Sundarban is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarban forest area, included in the UNESCO World Heritage List and located in India, was designated as Sundarban National Park.
These forests, which are not solely composed of mangrove swamps, also contain some of the last remaining trees from the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², with approximately 1/3 of it consisting of water and swamps.
Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. It is now estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Throughout the day, buses depart from the intercity bus station located by the river, but many of them, especially those heading east and the Jakar/Bumthang bus, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Intercity buses are usually crowded, so it's recommended to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
In most regions, comfortable and reliable small Japanese long-distance buses operate.
Taking a shared taxi to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200) is both fast and convenient.
The bridge over the Oyapok River is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapok River to connect cities in the Oyapok region of Brazil with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The bridge, with a length of 378 meters and a width of 3.50 meters featuring two lanes, is located between two towers with a height of 83 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Although construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to open in September 2017, which is when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to complete their work.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group, currently living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes in Eastern Paraguay and engaged in family-peasant agriculture.
Other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Quaycuru and Payaqua, who had settled in the Chaco region, engaged in hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of India," emerged in the 16th century as a result of Spanish conquistadors clashing with representatives of the indigenous population.
The Spanish colonial period lasted for 3 centuries.
Paraguay was able to preserve its national characteristics and identity after Asunción was founded in 1537.
Some of the best polo teams and players in the world are a factor that makes Argentina famous.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be found here.
If you want to learn about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), and its value is equal to that of one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, money can only be exchanged at the bank located in front of the "FIC West" store in Stanley.
Generally, Stanley credit cards and US dollars are accepted alongside British pounds sterling anywhere on the islands.
Credit cards probably won't be accepted on remote islands, but British and US currencies might be; clarify with the business owners in advance what payment system is used in the country you are travelling to.
Since it's almost impossible to exchange the currency used in the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, exchange your money before leaving the islands.
When it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer in Montevideo, which is located south of the equator, and vice versa: when it is summer there, it is winter here.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical climate zone, and the air temperature in the summer months usually exceeds +30°C.
These or similar situations demonstrate how deceptive winter cold can be, especially when the temperature is below freezing, and the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
Because the amount of rainfall throughout the year remains approximately the same, there are no specific concepts of "rainy" and "dry" seasons here.
Most of the animals in the zoo are used to seeing people, but their nature is still wild, so you shouldn't approach and feed or disturb them.
According to the park administration's warning, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
Bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals, no matter how docile they may seem, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a certain distance. Considering that these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, it is imperative to maintain distance from them.
Also, keep in mind that bears and other wildlife have a well-developed sense of smell, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Founded in the 1850s, Apia has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
Liman was a place that became famous for its maritime turmoil, where 7 ships from Germany, the United States of America, and England were refused departure in 1889.
All ships sank, with only one British cruiser remaining. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering organized in the city by the Mau movement resulted in the killing of high-ranking leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is located between two harbors, there are many beaches here. The most popular ones are in these three regions.
The "North Shore" beaches of the Pacific Ocean (the "North Harbour" port) stretch along the coast from Devonport in the south to "Long Bay" in the north.
Almost all sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and pohutukawa trees provide shady spots on most beaches.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located near the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious coastal suburbs of Mission Bay, and in the St Heliers part of central Auckland.
There are many shops on the shore of these beaches, which are also popular with families. It is safe to swim here.
The basic local beer, called "Number One", has a simple composition, a pleasant taste and is refreshing. The other one is "Manta".
While there are many French wines you could taste, you're more likely to find New Zealand and Australian wines here.
It is absolutely not dangerous to drink local tap water, and if you are wary of it, bottled water is also readily available.
The concept of "flat white" is foreign to Australians. "Espresso" is a strong black shot of coffee, cappuccino is a drink with cream on top (not foamy), and tea is served without milk.
You can find hot chocolate made according to genuine Belgian standards. Although the fruit juices taste great, they are expensive.
They have underwater trips throughout the year, and injuries resulting from these causes are rarely encountered on underwater rocks.
In any case, obtain recommendations from the authorities, adhering to all rules and paying attention to safety warning signs.
Flatback sea turtles emerge north of the 1770 region from October to April, near beaches and river basins. They can also be found outside of this period.
Sharks exist, though they rarely attack people. Most sharks do not swim in places close to people because they are afraid of them.
Saltwater crocodiles that do not lead an active lifestyle in the oceans primarily live in river basins north of Rockhampton.
By making reservations in advance, travelers don't have to worry about accommodation at their destination.
Travel agencies usually have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, or combine flight and hotel packages.
They can keep your order active if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents related to your destination (e.g., a visa).
For any adjustments or requests to be fulfilled, please contact the travel agency first, before the hotel.
At some of the festivals, the vast majority of participants set up camp on the grounds during music festivals, and many consider this the most important experience.
If you want to feel the excitement up close, then you should arrive early and reserve a spot to set up camp near the music.
Even if the music stops at the main stages, remember that there may be music in other sections of the festival until midnight.
At some festivals, special camping areas are allocated for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin floor, as the icy roads you pass can cause quite a noise for sensitive people.
Your time spent in the city is included in the St. Petersburg cruise trip. Cruise tourists do not require a visa (see stipulations).
Casinos typically do everything they can to maximize the time customers lose and the money they spend. There are no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
To keep their guests' spirits high and ensure they enjoy their stay, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served at home. However, being drunk leads to impaired judgment, and all experienced gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes and mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and freezing.
It is not possible to control a car on icy and snowy roads as you would on regular asphalt because the friction force is weak.
When a blizzard hits, so much snow can fall in a short time that you can become stranded in it.
Your visibility may be impaired by snowfall, blizzards, condensation and icing on your car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal for many countries, and traffic flow mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Probably, the most important tourism activity that attracts tourists' attention to Africa is safari tours.
The term safari, which is especially popular for overland travel undertaken to see Africa's magnificent wildlife, particularly in the savannas, is used.
Thanks to the standard equipment, it is possible to get a good view of some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, when they approach vehicles.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes hide themselves, and you can only see them with binoculars.
A safari walk (also called a "nature walk", "safari excursion", or "hike") consists of a walking trip lasting several hours or several days.

You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Most hotels have irons, and even if there isn't one in the room, you can borrow an iron and ironing board from the hotel.
If you don't have an iron, or if it's not essential that your socks are ironed, then you can use a hair dryer.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (this can cause the fabric to shrink, and even burn if more heat is applied).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against particular risks.
While boiling water for 1 minute might be enough in some regions, it can take several minutes in others.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if you have any doubts about it, you can buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers are likely to encounter animal parasites that they don't see in their own regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infections or dangerous animals that can cause physical harm or kill people are not usually considered pests.
Goods purchased from duty-free shops are not subject to duties and taxes in that location.
Tourists going to countries that impose high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money by shopping here, especially when buying alcohol and tobacco products.

The posted speed limits are noticeably low compared to the preceding and subsequent sections – generally 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h), making strict enforcement all the more important.
Interestingly, the mobile phone service is stronger here than in other parts of the route, e.g., Pennsylvania Wilds.
German-style flour products are quite delicious. In Bavaria, as in their southern neighbors Austria, they are extremely plentiful and diverse.
Fruit pastries, which can be baked with apples all year round, and can also use cherries and plums in the summer, are widespread.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes usually go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste small-sized but richly ingrediented pastries, try pancakes. Depending on the region, they are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a type of dish made with herbs and spices, as well as meat, vegetables, or both.

"Indonesian cuisine," with its 17,000 islands, is an umbrella term that generalizes the wide variety of regional cuisines of the peoples living there.
Nevertheless, without further explanation, the initial meaning of this term is aimed at describing food originating from the central and eastern regions of the island of Java.
Currently, the most used in the archipelago, there are a number of simple spicy dishes in Javanese cuisine, with the main flavors loved in Java being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hang from both sides of the horse's saddle, allowing the rider to pass their feet through and secure them.
They provide better stability for horse riders, but there is a risk of the rider's feet getting stuck between them.
If a rider jumping off a horse's foot gets stuck in the stirrup, they can be dragged on the ground as a result of the horse running away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures should be taken.
Traditionally, most horse riders wear heeled boots with smooth soles and a sufficiently narrow shaft.
In later periods, some saddles, most notably English saddles, began to be fitted with safety bars that would allow the stirrup to detach from the saddle when a rider fell off the horse.
Cochamo Valley, Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, consisting of various types of granite and cliffs.

Alpine skiing sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downhill on snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a primary travel activity for many adventure enthusiasts, who are sometimes called "ski fanatics." These people spend their entire vacations just skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing dates back to ancient times, to cave paintings depicting skiers from 5000 years BC.
The history of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century. The first ski resort was opened in Australia in 1861 by Norwegians.
Ski backpacking is also known as backcountry skiing (in remote areas with very few people), ski touring, or ski hiking.
Although this may be related to Alpine skiing tournaments or mountaineering, it does not generally encompass them, as mountaineering is a sport that takes place on steep cliffs and requires more rigid skis and snow boots.
A hiking trail and a ski trail look very similar.
When the conditions are favorable, you'll cover a distance a bit farther than you walk, but you can very rarely achieve ski-skating speed on groomed race courses without your heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent comprised of many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, when traveling here from many countries, it is necessary to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
Again, the Schengen Zone functions somewhat like a single state in this regard.
When you are in this area, you will have the opportunity to cross borders directly, that is, without the need for re-checking at passport control points.
Similarly, if you obtain a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a separate visa for each of the Schengen member countries. This saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal standard for determining whether prepared goods are antiques; only some tax authorities consider items over 100 years old to be antiques.

Although handicrafts may be younger than similar mass-produced goods, they can be considered antique items.
Reindeer husbandry is a vital source of income for the Sami people, and this culture, which incorporates commercial activity, is also important for many other professions.
Nevertheless, although traditional, not all Saami further expanded reindeer herding, but rather chose fishing, hunting, and other means of livelihood, using reindeer as draft animals.
Currently, many Sami people are engaged in modern forms of trade. Tourism is also of great importance in Sápmi, which is considered the Sami territory.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is usually considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.

Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to be able to pass through scanners while maintaining their privacy and sense of self.
Rip currents are strong, narrow currents flowing away from the beach, often occurring in rocky areas or similar locations.
Considering the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in a few relatively deeper points, from where it mixes into the deep water with a rapid flow.
Most fatalities occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is sometimes impossibly difficult.
Swimming against the current will not be as difficult as it was before, after getting out of the flow.
Try to swim somewhere you won't be caught by the current anymore, or wait to be rescued, considering your skills, or the place where they saw you.
Reverse culture shock manifests itself more quickly than culture shock (the lag phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Travelers who can easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own local culture.
It's normal to lose some habits specific to your own culture when you return home, as you've become accustomed to a new culture while living abroad.
When you travel to a foreign country for the first time, people were most likely patient and understanding towards you, taking into account that travelers arriving in a new country need time to adjust.
People may not realize that travelers returning home need patience and understanding.

Others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of still-active volcano creates a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region bordering the Bellingshausen Sea in the south of the Peninsula.
In this part of the peninsula, the mountains, which join the plateau, subsequently rise again, creating the 360 km-long Ellsworth Mountains range, which was split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range lies the Vinson Massif, home to Antarctica's highest mountains, located 4892 m from Mount Vinson.
In remote locations where mobile phone network service is unavailable, using a satellite phone might be your only option.
To make a phone call, you need to stand in an open area where your phone can clearly pick up the satellite line, which is why satellite phones cannot replace regular mobile phones.
This service is very often used by maritime transport, including cruise ships and exploration voyages that require remote internet connectivity or voice.
The local phone service provider should provide more detailed information about subscribing to this service.
The most popular options for those planning to take a sabbatical are traveling and learning.
This tradition is more popular among school graduates because they have the opportunity to take a gap year before continuing their education and starting university.
In most cases, taking a gap year dedicated to creative pursuits, enrolling in a course abroad, can increase your chances of getting higher education in your own country.
Traditionally, tuition fees will be required to register for such educational programs.
Finland is an ideal country for boat trips. In addition to being "the land of thousands of lakes," it also has thousands of islands in its lakes and in its coastal archipelago.
Having a yacht in archipelagos and lakes is not absolutely necessary.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any ship, smaller boats, even canoes, would offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This occupation is similar to the one in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but on the other hand, it is also unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, this figure is between 1-40).
Many Baltic Sea cruises feature extended stays in the Russian city of St. Petersburg.
This means that by returning and sleeping on the ship each night, you can spend two full days visiting this historic city.
If you only disembark on the coast as part of a cruise, you will not need a separate visa (information valid as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany, but as you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, therefore visiting the city is not included in the cruise prices.
For older individuals who have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event, or for people with bad memories, traveling by plane can be a frightening experience.
