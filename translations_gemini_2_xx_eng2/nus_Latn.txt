However, "duɔ̱rä" can have nuances. * **"kä AI ɣɛn ɣöö bi̱"**: This is where the "let AI help you" comes from.

I am interpreting "maciini̱ lät kɛn" as "internet" (machine network), and "go̱o̱r ŋäc ŋuaani̱" as "search for answers." Again, strong assumptions here. **To provide a better translation, I need clarification on:** * **The context of the conversation.** What are the speakers talking about? * **The specific meaning of "duɔ̱rä" and "ɣöö bi̱" in this context.** * **Whether "maciini̱ lät kɛn" is indeed referring to the internet.** * **A more precise understanding of what "go̱o̱r ŋäc ŋuaani̱" entails.** Please provide more information, and I'll do my best to give you an accurate translation!
