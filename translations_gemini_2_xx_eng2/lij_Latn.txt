Ring had finally resolved a case with a lawsuit from a competing security company, ADT Corporation.
Although an experimental vaccine seems promising in reducing Ebola mortality, there have so far been no medications that have been clearly demonstrated to be effective in treating an already established infection.
A mixture of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies have shown that it had fewer advantages than what was sought in preventing death.
In the PALM research, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to the other three treatments.

This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but it provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional shape.
Scientists say that the feathers of these animals were chestnut brown on top, with the underside being fawn or carrot-colored.
The discovery also allows a glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other kinds of feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers deduce that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other kinds.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or for display. Researchers have proposed that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the example shows the feathers of an adult and not the down of a chick.
Researchers have proposed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the example shows the feathers of a large one and not the downy fluff of a chick.

It was discovered that the sun behaved according to the same basic principles as other stars: it was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system is governed by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team is studying would be caused by the gravitational force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter conditions other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of swarms of tiny particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed paper ballot indicating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the staff have verified the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting register.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that at the beginning of the vote there are no envelopes inside and that no envelopes are added, except for those of voters duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to attend every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

Chris Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take the ministry for Business, Innovation and Skills. Davey is currently a minister without portfolio.
Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates Court on February 16th.
The deceased were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla suffered fractures to an arm and the jaw, so much so that Kristoffer Schneider needs reconstructive surgery for his face.
The weapon of Uka failed so badly that it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has always had two, an eye socket, a missing section of the skull, and a titanium reconstructed face.
Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his homeland.
In addition to the event on Monday, in Carpanedo she participated in two individual races at the championships.
The first was the slalom, where she had a Did Not Finish in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
The other day, in the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's session group were unable to finish their race, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom were unable to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the laptop and cell phone that were stolen.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house, when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
During all the storms, the helmsman suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he had been taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was relocated to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been appearing at the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh since then, accused of murdering her son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the testimonial evidence may be compromised, given that his image has been published everywhere.
While it's common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee observes that “journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects”.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for criminal prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leaks, would refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
Other topics that were discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, while the PA only agrees to allow this presence for five years.
The bats in the additional disinfestation test had to be closely monitored by the rangers, so much so that the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the current director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first culling operation have received complete safety instruction and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP).
It is the first CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of holding elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
It has been reported roughly 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods, which have caused a total of six fires and left four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said he had been warned of 27 accidents related to the instrument.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The minister responded by calling Apple's report delay "truly reprehensible."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The emergency management office in the Northern Marianas has stated that no emergencies have been reported in that state.
Even the Tsunami Warning Center in the Pacific said that there was no tsunami risk.
A Filipino policeman, now no longer in service, held tourists from Hong Kong hostage after taking control of their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Reportedly, hostages have been rescued and, for now, at least six have been declared dead.
Six hostages, including children and an elderly person, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old lady who had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down with firearms.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his career in medicine.
He studied obstetrics and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying the condition of premature babies in his spare time.
Their research showed that, if a hormone was administered, it accelerated the fetal respiratory maturation of the child.
Xinhua reports that government investigators recovered two flight recorder "black boxes" on Monday.
The wrestler comrades also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. Beautiful and unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "the Moon was strange like me... maybe never again... love her and lose her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those in the survey share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those interviewed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his problems his form was in doubt.
He couldn't take the medicines he needed to overcome his illness, because they were banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Many people have verified the discovery using different hardware and software since the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water that arrived on Earth together with organic matter which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets crashed into the Earth in ancient times.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his governorship at the beginning of this year and last month he signed a law that legalizes marriage between people of the same sex.
He defined the votes as "clear and political follies".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
They should use satellite technology in contrast to the old technology based on ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport has been put in place and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride are not available on site.
Fears about the lack of transport have raised the possibility that they may be forced to play the match behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
A study, published yesterday in the journal Science, reported on the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
The egg can be worked in all sorts of shapes. It can be cast into tiny molds.
It can be spun into a thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or flattened into sheets.
It can be beaten very, very thin and glued onto another metal. Or it can be made so thin, that sometimes it was used to decorate the images painted by hand in the books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is what is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on whether the chemical product is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean and wet hands, crush them into a ball.
The humidity on the walls reacts with the external salts, which feel strange and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, almost in every house, connected to a sophisticated system of drains.
Remnants of sewer pipes have been found in the Minoan city houses of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were public baths in ancient Egypt as well, in Persia and in China. In Roman civilization, toilets were often part of public baths where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you know that you have to use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it down immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts our light and vision.
It takes a rocket much more than 100 feet tall to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an unbelievable way. The most important thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster transport.
We brought the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Underneath them, there are felines of medium size that eat prey of medium size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In the end, there are many small cats (including domestic kittens) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, crickets and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special behavior that each feline adopts, which prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social felines, and they live in large groups, called prides.
The herds are made up of one to three large, breeding males, together with thirty females and the young.
Generally, the females are closely related to each other, and they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very much like wolf or dog packs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in their behavior, and very deadly to their prey as well.
As a well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (but not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human being.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a phrase from angry and screaming hens.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, marmosets, rodents, and birds, if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and blend in very furtively as well. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (such as when they move across a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island, in such a way that they can no longer easily return) they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were previously in.
This new environment here has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it gradually begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they could no longer be called the same species.
Let's call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is to say, that they breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also give us shade.
We build our houses with plants and we make clothes with plants. So much food that we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, consequently it had no fear of anything, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were adorned with more than 70 teeth sharpened like razors, with one extra placed in the roof of his mouth, as if to say there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it may have even been a cannibal.
He would also help everything that fell into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex couldn't have beaten him.
So much so that most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or curious festive food, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich had to organize banquets where they reclined on one side, while consuming meals.
The meals of the ancient Romans couldn't include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a principal temple to each of their gods, which was considered the god's house.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
All temples had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they were built, like a part of temples, as special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats.
The tower's top was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house wasn't very important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was spent outdoors.
The women were busy preparing food in the courtyard; the shops were just open doorways facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There weren't big forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for homicide and, when he travelled further west, he found Greenland, and he named it Greenland.
But, regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there, at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure" you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the "Declaration of Independence".
For the rest, it's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.

Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is said that at the beginning of its life, the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was folded to be preserved.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added only as a label.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the North of France, but the South was not yet free.
It was governed by the French "of Vichy". These were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had collaborated with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the South of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, and it has a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means "civil", which signifies "citizen", and "civitas", which means "city" or "city-state", and which in some way also defines the dimension of society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civic-type culture carries with it the transmission of knowledge across different generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and an equal diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true and proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government – with the Congress as the only component – according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, since there was no executive or judiciary, it relied on the central authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to annul the fiscal laws and tariffs between the states.
The Statute required unanimous consent from all the states before it could be modified, and the states took the central government not so seriously since their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most practiced in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often indicated, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa", or "very beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 and perhaps from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), they took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu develops around three principal structures, that is to say the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings near the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues even today.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the era of analog film.
It is still produced today, but above all its proportions have been inherited from the formats of the image sensors of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing: 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the proportion of this cheese (dividing by twelve, to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many common forms (for example the APS format family) are equal to or very close to these proportions.
Using the rule of thirds too much and too often risks becoming a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
It is stated that the most effective position for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion held the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His power pervaded everything and affected everyone, from the king to the ordinary person.
One of the first Christian principles is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and misery, and that the Church's monetary funds are here precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to wonder if this principle was just.
Just after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiates a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proves effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violates accepted international law, codified in various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent anyone from entering certain areas of the ocean, also causing danger to neutral ships.
Since there had been a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude on the part of citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of war in the First World War, the nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cities named after him, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his foreman in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Thus, between one dynasty and another, there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
In these times, there were two wars between different nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the ancient history of China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
After the Revolution and occupations, offices were opened to all male candidates, thus allowing the ambitious and successful to advance.
Same goes for the military, because instead of basing army ranks on class, they were now based on importance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people oppressed by the working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
His mother was deeply interested in questions beyond this mundane life. He frequented a cave which became famous with the name "Hira", on the mountain of "Noor" (light for contemplation).
The greatest cave, surviving the times, exhibits a very vivid image of Möma's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, it's not at all easy to find it so well, even though we know it existed. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
You can only see the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains that are around. Very little of this world can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing.
Built from the Egyptian era of the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arch up" sign looks like a "V" and the "arch down" sign looks like a paperclip, or a painting without the bottom side.
"Sciù" means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and "zu" means that you should start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow high up usually produces a softer sound, whereas a bow lower down is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your markings with a pencil, but remember that the penciled-in cues are there for a musical reason, so usually they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrified, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, eleven years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old) and his sister, Madame Elisabeth, on October 6, 1789, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
Inside a carriage, they return to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shout and scream threats against the king and queen.
A crowd of people forces the king and queen to hold onto the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, one of this mob brandishes the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles, then at the terrified queen.
The costs of the US imperialism's war for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the expenses, and the interest on bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government, through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Naturally, the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the primary gain of Filipino imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that pushed for the creation of the order.
The era in which the events unfolded is usually indicated by the name High Middle Ages, or the period of European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological impetus or technological imperative in the strict sense, according to which the destiny of men is guided by an underground logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows its own path beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology inherently has "effects" on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car engine necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Regarding all the coastlines, a national road network is not economically sustainable only for a few cars, and so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The excessive weight of cars also leads to a high incidence of accidents on the roads, which necessitates the invention of new treatment techniques in healthcare to care for the damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time it fostered customs and cultures tied to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury had begun more or less around 400 A.D. and lasted more or less until 1100 A.D.
Its condition declined in the twelfth century, especially due to the fact that the Crusaders had come back with gifts like silks and spices that were considered superior to those that Byzantine merchants displayed.
It was in those times that the title of Fashion Capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
For the rest, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the era, following the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done for the production of food sufficient to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses original seeds recovered from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who think alike, and who feel neglected by social standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive based on the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or voluntary abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their developmental phase.
These children are called "bestial" or "wild". Some wild children have been confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Young wild children can today suffer serious abuse or childhood trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others think they were raised by animals; they say that someone lived alone in nature.
When raised completely by non-human animals, the feral child displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost equal to those of the particular animal that takes care of him, such as his fear or indifference towards humans.
So much so that the approach based on projects should make it easier to learn, and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of entrepreneurship, but rather a support that provides assistance to people who are facing a new entrepreneurial experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be either virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the paperclip assistant from Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are internalized into the software and have the purpose of putting into discussion, suggesting, and explaining procedures that might be difficult for the student to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that isn't stimulating, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We would consider that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide stable homes, loving educators, stable instruction, and reliable healthcare.
The foster care service had to provide everything necessary that was lacking in the house from which they had been taken previously.
The Internet combines both mass media elements and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and approach to gratification.
For example, "to learn" and "to socialize" are proposed as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few seconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out how people who are unable to understand a speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess its sincerity.
It even suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there exist two basins of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of manifested variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation forward and backward between the two pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate, with a digestive system like that of a human, to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, the impossibility of doing so has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in the leaves of legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not easily digested, but they provide high quantities of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" a little like savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of waking up deliberately during a normal sleep period, and falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done gently, using a rather quiet alarm clock to bring them back to consciousness without fully waking them up again.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm so much that you fall back asleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, thus forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm involve the consumption of many liquids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleeping, thus forcing one to stay awake to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been extended by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everything.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga deity. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and culture led to disagreement between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the old allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would have been hard for the 40 years after and it would have been really fought, by proxy armies, on the battlefields of Africa, Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in so many other places.
Before September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these tanks became almost obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army and the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the navy is traditionally to guarantee that your country maintains the capacity to move its people and its goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One recent example of this most worthy of attention was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about ten thousand years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goat herders who were often children, more or less grown, similar to the shepherd we know. These herding methods are still used today.
The wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carts were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and to haul larger loads, compared to the slightly more bumpy roads of those times.
The crossbars were introduced rather quickly to keep the slides in position. In any case, it gradually became clear that the tracks would have been more efficient if they had a point of iron on the upper part.
This is becoming a common practice, but the iron was causing more wear on the wheels of the carts.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron. In 1767 the first iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago, with the spread of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also be activists, to reduce future suffering to some extent.
Being here, many times, is really just like a symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, if we don't want a solution that is only temporary, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is easily understood that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems have become more numerous due to overpopulation and the unbalanced lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by the Congress, on July 4th, a handwritten copy signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was sent a short distance to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known during the day as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten copy has not survived.
Several paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They call them birds.
Some people don't recognize dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are several things in birds that still seem like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is to say 0 or 1, and these numbers are indicated as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning or decay may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are never so general as to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the package insert for specific first aid instructions for that specific venom.
The term "scimixa" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of little animals.
This term likely comes from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are creatures highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin monkeys and bed monkeys are animals that make a nest, and that are good at living in the nest or in the house of their host.
In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the main neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women are twice as likely to have MS compared to men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can act as parents to the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method in fact guides most scientific research.
It is not only experimentation, however, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more hypotheses, pose questions, and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrated on the classical texts and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
The opinions of Aristotle were accepted on all scientific questions, including psychology.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.

Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, and plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that maintain a cyclical period in free-running conditions, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacillus.
Two experiments were done, marking either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material of the affected section, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and getting to know the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their cars in the small city to go to work, and are overtaken by others, whose workplace is the place that the first ones have just left.
In this spiderweb of dynamic transport, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Current science indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and should use the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears about levels of complaint equal to those regarding water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems create such problems, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement between two points of individual drivers and vehicles, and the interactions they create between each other.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to have behaviors within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and management of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly has helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend and elongate their bodies. This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
This gives it a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are stoneflies and mayflies.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and also the other stars).
This seems absurd, because we don't perceive the Earth as if it were moving, isn't it true?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A good 20 percent of the water poured into the oceans of the planet comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River's main length is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and in the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work for the State, so much so that Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
People knew the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, or copper, because these could all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many, many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver or gold.
You can also have alloys that include small quantities of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of billions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people, when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pen has been relegated to a status and uses that are minor.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a pen.
One can only wonder what will happen to the head when something new arrives.
An atomic bomb works according to the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with so many protons and neutrons.
A bit like struggling to pull a heavy cart up a hill. By dividing the nucleus again, therefore, part of that energy is released.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70km thick on the near side and 100km thick on the far side.
It is softer under the sea and harder under the bridges.
There might have been more sea on that nearby side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates people to behave in a certain way, or to be attracted to something.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow from childhood to adulthood.
These theories aim at what someone has seen with certain people that makes them desire the things that they do, and what those things will or will not make them do in their environment.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In the workplace, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has done, and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often translates into rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of the virtual team act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy compared to the members of a conventional team because their teams can meet based on variable time zones that might not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership group to which all members refer. The invisible team establishes the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to face the long process of establishing a learning organization? One objective for putting the concepts of organizational entrepreneurship into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization that works together to overcome a gap can lead to a new innovative process to satisfy the customer's requirements.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational entrepreneurship.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide evidence for a theoretical method of investigating cognition. Therefore, they narrow the area of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for some time that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, or tumors, influence behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and processes of the brain never seen before.
Here, it provides a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines to automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is often used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military sectors because it has been constituted in various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Very often a teacher would like to take their students to places for which traveling by bus is not an option.
The technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Virtually sharing a school trip is also a way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state's capital, every year the website is remodeled, but the old versions are kept online as a memory album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. So much so that students often start their experience on the blog with a sloppy grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience behind them changes things.
Since students are often a critical audience, the blog writer is starting to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Also, the blog "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages extending entrepreneurship far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can allow students to become more analytical and critical; through an active response to materials on the internet, students can define their positions in the context of the writings of others and delineate their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, and it presents a series of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north it hosts the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and even more.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is typically considered Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated, and some are wild and almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are found in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the biggest island of the two, and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France and known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it had great success in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is delimited by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: all women traveling are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also useful to bring a ring (just one that isn't too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in something that can be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stand firm in rebuffing men and don't be afraid to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city like Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old town it's easy to find places that sell traditional products like towels, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo located in the westernmost part of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, visits outside Goma can help to understand the state of conflict that persists in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as for cheaper gorilla trekking tours in Africa.
To get around in Goma, you can use boda-bodas (that is, motorcycle taxis). The common price for a short ride is about 500 Congolese francs.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and faraway lands.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
Since 1990 it has been added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert locusts.
It was one of the main stops in the PBS special "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African atmosphere.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, so much so that the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and has been considered the gem of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
It might also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main objective.
The row of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a bright barcode made visible by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and then head towards the Kowloon waterfront.
A large majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely populated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own, and so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps: they include some of the last remaining vigorous jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is covered by water areas or swamps.
Since 1966 the Sunderbans have been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since interdistrict buses are often full, it is advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, sturdy Japanese-made buses, which are quite comfortable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to reach nearby places, such as Paro (Nu150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The full operativity of the bridge is expected for September 2017, when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be finished.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group among those who inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guayacurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called "the giant province of the Indies", was born from the meeting of Spanish conquerors with the original indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a good part of its character and its indigenous identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
The tournaments and minor matches here can also be seen in other periods of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is fixed to be equal to that of the British pound.
The money can be exchanged at the only bank located in Stanley, after the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currencies might be used; check in advance with the owners to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It's almost impossible to change Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, summer is there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, with summer months commonly experiencing temperatures above 30 degrees.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There aren't particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of water remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they haven't kept a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Furthermore, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or preparing food that smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval blockade in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German victims were lost.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamanese Lealofi III.
There are many marinas, due to the fact that Auckland is divided between two harbors. The most popular ones are in the three areas.
The shores of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with sure footing, and most of them have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The shores of Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the inner areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sea locations for families often full of people with a nice row of shops lined up along the square. Genoa is for sure.
The main local beer is the "Number One", it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
He has many French wines to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee was foreign. A short black is an "espresso", a cappuccino comes filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate here is on par with Belgian standards. The fruit juices are so-so but very good.
Many trips to the coral reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
However, keep in mind the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish are found near the squares and near the mouths of rivers from October to February north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside these periods.
Sharks exist, but it's difficult for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking the trip in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of having a place to sleep, once arrived at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you might find the possibility to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight/hotel packages.
You can also keep the reservation on hold for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. the visa).
Any changes or questions must be reviewed in advance, through the travel agent, and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals decide to camp on site, and most people consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music in the main parks might be finished, there could still be sections of the festival that continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's position, because crossing the ice causes a rather horrible noise for those who are more exposed to it.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. The balconies and aerial views are absent and the exits can be difficult to find.
Usually, they offer special deals on food, drinks, and demonstrations, to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks inside the house. However, drunkenness compromises judgment and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Whoever drives at certain latitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you can't drive like you would on new asphalt.
In snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that it's enough to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or condensation, or by ice on the vehicle's windshield wipers.
Otherwise, the ice and snow conditions are normal in many villages and traffic continues mostly without interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in popular usage, refers to overland journeys to see the magnificent African fauna, especially in the savanna.
Certain animals, like elephants or giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and standard equipment, allowing for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you would see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "walking in the bush", "safari excursion" or "hiking") consists of an excursion, of a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics were held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events were held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having organized the 1964 games.
If you had booked the seats and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, although they are not present in the room.
If a steam iron isn't available, or if you don't feel like wearing ironed trousers, you can try using a hairdryer, if there is one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric too much (as it can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are various ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In certain areas it is sufficient to boil the water for a minute, in others several minutes are necessary.
Water filters vary in effectiveness and, if in doubt, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal parasites with which they are not familiar in their regions of origin.
Parasites can ruin food, cause irritation, or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Highly infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force, are usually not classified as parasites.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with heavy taxation can save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, with constant passage through isolated terrain in the woods.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your concentration up: steep slopes, narrow alleyways, and hairpin bends are common.
The posted speed limits are much lower than the preceding and following stretches – around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than elsewhere.
Curiously, however, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, for example, the wild lands of Pennsylvania.
The German sweets with cream are very good and, in Bavaria, are quite rich and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with cooked medlars in jam all year round, and cherries and plums that make their appearance in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, try those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and in certain other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term that covers a vast range of regional cuisines present throughout the nation.
However, if used without further qualification, the term tends to refer to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely available eggs throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a wide range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that Javanese people prefer are pistachios, peppers, peanuts (especially Javanese coconut peanut), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the knight's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the kayaker but can cause safety problems due to the possibility of the kayaker's feet getting stuck inside.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk to a minimum, it is possible to adopt a series of safety precautions.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, certain saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to come off the saddle if a rider falls.
Cochamó Valley – the main climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of big walls and granite cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking mountain views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly opening new routes, drawn by its infinite climbing potential.
Winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important itinerant activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations in a particular place around skiing.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Sack on your shoulders with skis: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is connected, but usually it doesn't involve ski mountaineering or alpine style climbing, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions you would be able to cover distances a little longer than on foot, but you would only very rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy load on beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen area, after all, functions in some way like a single country, in this sense.
As long as you stay within this zone, by plane you can cross the borders without going through the passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which objects are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be shorter in places like North America, rather than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of sustenance among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many people with other professions.
Traditionally, furthermore, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although it is used in the area, especially among non-Roma, the word "zingaro" is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You could also want to consult the advice of governments different from yours, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might find themselves later in different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
Bulletins are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The points of view presented are often superficial, general, and far too simplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any dangerous atmospheric phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Bad weather can be verified in any part of the world and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of bad weather, as are blizzards, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal meteorological phenomena include snow flurries, snow storms, hail storms and rain storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of bad weather affecting their area as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should obtain professional training.
A search on the internet for a "Course on hostile environments" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will probably cover all the issues discussed here in a much more detailed way, usually with practical experience.
Usually, a course lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing games, first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications that deal with war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they bring valid documents for the return trip.
The availability of governments to issue passports with an undesignated (X) gender or updated documents to correspond to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as widely variable.
Security check procedures have also become much more invasive in the era following September 11, 2001.
Transgender people prior to surgery should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves that break offshore, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in certain deeper sections, and there a fast current could form towards the deep waters.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim upstream, which could be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, going back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to look somewhere where you won't get caught again or, depending on your ability, and if you're a good swimmer, you might want to wait for the rescue.
Return shock arrives earlier than that linked to culture (or not linked to the charm of discovering something new), it lasts longer and can have stronger effects.
People who have adapted to a new culture often have difficulty readjusting to their culture of origin.
When someone returns home after living abroad, they are accustomed to the new culture and have lost some ties to their own culture of origin.
When you go abroad, for the first few times, in all likelihood, people are patient and understanding, because they know that whoever goes to live in a foreign country needs to adapt.
People cannot imagine that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The spectacle of dreams and luxury of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids at dawn and be able to see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually here you can hear the breath of tourists and sellers. The story of sound and light is just like one you can find in a book.
The Sphinx is in the background and acts as the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are contested by several nations and have many bases: in 2020, sixteen of them were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the Villa Las Estrellas site is located.
Others include Livingston and Deception Islands, where the caldera flooded by an active volcano still provides a marvelous natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula blend with the high plateau, to re-emerge and form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
Apart from the north, the Sentinel Range has the steepest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where cell phones have no coverage, the only option that remains could be that of a satellite phone.
Usually, a satellite phone cannot replace a mobile phone, since in order to make a call you need to be outside in a position where the satellite can clearly locate you.
This service is frequently used by boats, including recreational ones, as well as expeditions that have data and voice communication needs over long distances.
Your local telephone company should be able to give you more in-depth information for connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who want to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is most frequent among those who have just finished school, as it allows them to spend a year outside the state before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, attending a course during a gap year abroad can increase the chances of entering advanced training programs once one has returned to their country of origin.
Usually, to enroll in these training programs, you need to pay an entry fee.
Finland is an important destination for boats. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
Among archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for all yachts, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is equal to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but still unique elsewhere (e.g. in Holland the ratio is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stop in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
So you can visit the historical city for a couple of full days and return to the ship in the evening to sleep there.
Landing on the ground only for an organized excursion will not require a visa (starting from 2009).
Some cruises present Berlin, in Germany, in their advertising brochures. As can be seen in the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling on an airplane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from having personal phobias, a dislike for something, or other fixations that so many other people have.
For some, the fact of understanding some data about how an airplane works and what happens when you fly could be helpful in overcoming a fear based on something you don't know or don't have control over.
I run and get paid well for delivering things to the shipping company. Often the timing is very important when dealing with business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For certain trips, the larger companies have their own planes, but for others and for the smaller companies, there was a problem.
If the goods were shipped by air, on some routes it may have taken days to clear customs and be released from cargo.
The only way to get it through faster would have been to ship it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow shipping baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class or business class is to take out a nice wad of cash (or, even better, have the company where you work do it).
But comfort doesn't come cheap: usually the cost of business class is even four times greater than that of economy class, while first class, on the other hand, is eleven times as much!
As a matter of principle, there's no reason to look for discounts on first class or business class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know very well that there is a certain quantity of travelers who would pay even an eye from their head for the privilege of arriving at a certain place quickly and in full comfort, and they set prices precisely based on this fact.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldavia is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
Since 1994 this conflict has led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member state of the European Union.
Although political negotiations have failed, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million people, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent strategic point for transport.
The ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern commercial center, developed and full of people, located around an enormous bay and with mountains all around.
Wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are punctuated by traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, on top of some tombs there are interesting sculptures of marble doves.
It's worth taking a half-hour stroll around this intriguing village.
To the north, at a short distance, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which foreigners have come to know thanks to the passionate descriptions of its splendors made by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Always to the north, visit the grand sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine), a place where Marian apparitions known throughout the world are said to have occurred.
Remember that essentially you are visiting the site of a mass grave, and also a site that has an almost inestimable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who lived here at that time, and many others who had relatives who were imprisoned or died here after having worked here, whether they were Jewish or not.
I have the love to treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect that it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not ruin the site by making marks or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people find it easier to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
To all sailors, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because according to the law it is the primary official language.
Although, Spanish is also widely used on public transport and for other services.
Regular announcements on the subway are only in Catalan, but unscheduled service disruptions are announced automatically in a wide range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians are often considered to be an egotistical, rude, and arrogant people.
Although this is mostly an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to visit Paris without problems is to behave as well as possible, according to the behaviour of a "bien elevée" (well-behaved) person. This way, getting around the city will be much easier.
The brusque Parisian quickly realized that she would have to show some courteous manners if she wanted to be liked.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded and mainly comprises beeches, firs and pines, and presents alpine vegetation mixed with Mediterranean vegetation.
It presents a wide variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying altitude.
This area presents a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
You can find rare fauna like the common European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the badger, the lynx, the wildcat, and the western capercaillie, along with many other more common species.
During the visit to the monastery, it is necessary that women have skirts that reach to the knees and that they cover their shoulders as well.
Most of the monastery provides travel blankets for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it has bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Likewise, men are also asked that their pants cover their knees.
These ones can also be taken from the warehouse at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed every time someone puts them on, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing these uniforms. For men, there is only one size!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of other areas facing the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil extensively.
A simple and popular snack, especially in summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato, and any condiment such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, and also the word "Sie" which translates the form of courtesy, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish verbs from objects.
Probably what makes the reading even easier, although the writing is a bit complicated by the need to understand if a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
The pronunciation of Italian is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The letters that require the most attention are "c" and "g", because their pronunciation changes based on the following vowel.
Also, pay attention to pronouncing the single "r" and double "rr" differently: "caro" means 'dear', "carro" means 'cart'.
The Ligurian language has a relatively easy and, for the most part, regular grammar.
Thus, reading this grammatical compendium will help you learn most of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
To all those who already know a little Spanish, it might be tempting to conclude, a bit too hastily, that Portuguese is so similar that there's no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories for the most part today are too old to be used, and remain as museums or training sites.
Given that in the good old days light pollution wasn't the same problem as today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, and are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures located in isolated areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The vision of skirts riding high, known as hakama, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The idea came from China, where the flowers of plum trees were the most valued.
In Japan, the first festivals for churches on the lands were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy linked to the emperor's court.
The most beautiful plants are those found in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
During a visit to a garden organized according to formal criteria, the act of uprooting "specimens" for collection will also be punished with expulsion from the garden, without discussion.
For common people, Singapore is an extremely safe place where it is easy to move, and after arriving it is possible to buy almost everything that is needed.
But given that it is located in the "high tropics," a few degrees above the equator, you will have to fight as much with the heat (constantly) as with the sun beating down (when the sky is clear, which happens more rarely).
There are also buses that go north towards Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish site near it, in Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good subject for a vacation.
For example, to visit castles in the upper Loire valley, in the Rhine valley or to take a cruise towards interesting cities on the Danube or to navigate on the Erie Canal.
They also define the popular hiking and cycling routes among the people.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays for Christians, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions linked to this festivity have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some place where you can see the sky, to watch the sunrise.
It is understood that there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well also be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
Often the more traditional churches organize a vigil on Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregations often starting to celebrate at sundown until midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived here in the past did so by flight, by swimming, or by floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not complete the journey, so in the Galapagos the giant tortoise is the main shelled animal.
Since man arrived in the Galapagos, a large number of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you might experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This event presents a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, given that the sky will be dark all day long almost entirely.
Given that the areas are sparsely populated, and consequently light pollution is often not a problem, you could also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The clothes are the standard ones for business, and colleagues call each other by their last name or by their job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental, and emphasizing group effort is more important than praising personal success.
Those who work a lot often have to obtain permission from their superiors for all the decisions they make, and are expected to obey the orders of their superiors without asking questions.
