This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but provides details that cannot usually be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional presentation.
According to scientists, on the upper part, this animal had chestnut-brown feathers and, on the lower part, feathers with a pale or carotenoid color.
This discovery also gives us an idea about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, called the "rachis," but share other characteristics with modern feathers, such as barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these features.
The structure of the feathers makes you think that they were not used for flying, but more for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers believe that the sample shows an adult feather, not a down feather, even though this is the tail of a small dinosaur.
The researchers were of the opinion that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather and not a small bird's down.

They discovered that the Sun's functioning is based on the same fundamental principles as other stars. The conclusions showed that activity in all stars of the system was governed by their luminosity and rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the value of the Rossby number (Ro), the less active the star is in reversing the polarity of its magnetic field.

The work done was more theoretical, even though the program was designed to simulate observations made on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert force on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a halo shape and consists of many small particles.

They are colder than their surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it's consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and slip a pre-printed paper ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside before voting begins and that no envelopes are added except those of the counted and duly authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives as witnesses to any part of the process. The votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict supervision, following the appropriate procedures.

The victims were Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old, and Nicholas Alden, 25 years old. Cuddeback had been the driver of the car.
Edgar Veguilla was wounded in the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider suffered injuries that required surgery to reconstruct his face.
Uka's gun jammed when he pointed it at the fifth person's head. Schneider has constant pain, is blind in one eye, is missing a piece of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a US Air Force base in his home country.
Besides Wednesday's event, Carpanedo also competed in two individual races at the championship.
Her first event was the slalom, where she received "Did Not Finish" on her first attempt. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In her next race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group, with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Austrian Klaudia Lősch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's sitting ski category failed to finish their race, and 45 out of 117 total skiers at the Alpine Skiing World Championships failed to qualify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
The Deputy Inspector General, D K Arya, said: "We have arrested the five people who raped the Swiss citizen and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused arrived at court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to "James Paget" Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused of killing her son in the Edinburgh First Instance Court.
She is in pre-trial detention awaiting indictment and the start of the trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scots law operates differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial to the case.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee emphasizes that "it seems journalists are treading a dangerous path if they publish photos etc. of suspected individuals."
The Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for all criminal prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment is announced.
According to reports, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants according to the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
It is thought that other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Until the signing of this agreement, Israel wants a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian authorities agree to allow their presence for only five years.
The shooters had to be closely supervised by guards during the additional pest control test, as the test was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director for Park Protection and Heritage at the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have been given extensive instructions on their safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council for Martell in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were caused by the lack of elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating due to malfunction have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it had been made aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry announced last week that Apple had informed it of 34 further overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry reacted by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 PM local time (Friday at 09:19 AM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said it had not received reports of damage in the area.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman after she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liginsi followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liginsi began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone is administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs in infants.
"Xinhua" reported that state investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
Tomi Drimer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Quite rare, like she herself was. A strong woman."
Dastin "Goldast" Ranelsi commented that: "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even more so... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
In a poll of 1400 people before the 2010 federal election, opponents of Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of people in the survey share this opinion, according to which they wish that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch of Australia.
In the extreme responses to the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical fitness has been uncertain.
He couldn't get the right medication to overcome his pain, as they are banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
The discovery was verified by many people using different devices and software in early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of delivering water to Earth, along with organic matter that could create proteins and help life.
Scientists hope to understand the creation of planets, especially how Earth was formed from the collision of comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political fabrications and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA's claims, will allow airplanes to travel on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite technology, compared to the old technology that relied on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate the aircraft more accurately and give pilots more precise information.
There will be no additional transportation and overground trains will not stop at "Wembley", and car parking facilities, as well as park and ride, are not available for the playing field.
The fear of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would be played obligatorily behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process took longer, due to crossbreeding between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be beaten into thin sheets.
It can be drawn and made into thin wire, which can then be twisted and woven. It can be hammered into sheets or rolled into sheets.
It can be thinned excessively and combined with other metals. It could be thinned so much that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidic or alkaline (basic) level of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one electron and one proton).
Mix the two dry powders, and then, with wet and clean hands, squeeze them together to form a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every dwelling, connected to a rather complex sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of mixed-gender public bathhouses.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away from you, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by means of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
For placing a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket with a height of over 100 feet is needed.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has brought us is that it has provided us with a much faster and much easier means of transportation.
She brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are cats larger than average that feed on prey of average size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In conclusion, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat far more small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the niche concept, a special function that every cat has that doesn't allow it to compete with the others.
Lions are the most social felines. They live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three related adult males, together with up to thirty females and cubs.
Women, being part of a large family of sisters and daughters, generally have closer bonds with each other.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals with behavior strikingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats) and just as deadly to their prey.
As a very well-prepared athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like the full-throated roar of a lion, but is more like a sentence made up of growls and screams.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals. When they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller in size than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals (their prey) through scent, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and move very stealthily as well. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (such as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they go to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than was previously necessary.
The original population hasn't changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
With the passage of time, with the beginning of the new population's adaptation to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is a very important part and an inevitable consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, that humans release through breathing).
Plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses with plants and create clothing with plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the roof of his mouth, meaning nothing that crossed his path escaped him.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had his tongue like a fork. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have even been a cannibal.
He would also attack anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not defeat him.
Although we would recognize most of their food, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual items for feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, rich men preferred to eat together in feasts, where they ate their meals reclining on their hips.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that came from America or Asia to Europe during later centuries.
They, for example, had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and there is not even an ancient Roman who ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was called the house of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to take care of the gods' needs through celebrations and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as an integral part of temples, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built.
The tower's peak was a special sanctuary for the god.
The apartment wasn't so important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Life in a Jewish family took place mainly in the open air.
The women cooked meals in the courtyard; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few settlements. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, on his voyages westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time, regardless of its discovery.
Although every country was "Scandinavian", there were considerable differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of this document, written upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
For this reason, it is possible that the note was only placed as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south remained occupied.
He was governed by the French of the Vichy regime. They were French who, in 1940, had chosen to make peace with the Germans and had collaborated with the occupiers, instead of fighting against them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and were continuing towards Germany.
Civilization is the name given to a specific and shared culture of a fairly large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis" which means "civil," which is related to the Latin word "civis" meaning "citizen" and "civitas" meaning "city" or "city-state," which in a way also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors to states. A civilizing culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a continuous cultural footprint, and a fair diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies first created a weak central government—with Congress as its only structure—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Furthermore, he did not have the authority to violate the laws on taxes and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so unseriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, like the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and in 2006, they were the FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, starting with the Italians who compete in both international games and Olympic events.
Japan contains almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to Japan's cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to, in geographic terms, as an "archipelago."
The origin of Taiwan dates back a long time, to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island."
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of local grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas in western and northern Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed it until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photograph format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It continues to be produced even today, and above all, in the same format inherited from the image sensor of a digital camera.
The 35 mm format is, in fact, somewhat confusing, being 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio with whole numbers) comes out to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are the same as or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
He determines that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, was viewed with a scrutinizing eye.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith had linked European states to one another, regardless of differences in language and customs.
His power, which was felt everywhere, affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are specifically there for that reason.
The main organs of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being followed.
Immediately after the start of military fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent the entry of all ships into entire sections of the ocean, even endangering neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany hoped for a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
The prevailing attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations during the 1920s were pacifism and isolationism.
After the horrors and atrocities during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States of America to accept a job at the "Edison" company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with only 4 cents in his account, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of recounting different periods of time; each era of China or each family that held power was a recognized dynasty.
Also, between each of the dynasties there was an unstable period with divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war was waged between many nobles, who were fighting for the throne.
"The Three Kingdoms" was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, in which thousands of people died in the struggle to occupy the highest position in the great palace in Xian.
It has many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, job opportunities also opened up for all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
This also applies to the military because instead of military ranks being based on category, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was most interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He often went to meditate in a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light).
The very cave that survived the ages gives a very vivid reflection of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
This cave, which is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not at all easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
You can see nothing else but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains that surround you. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that continues to stand today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Khufu), several smaller tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "caret" symbol looks like a V, and the "cup" symbol looks like a paperclip or a square without its bottom side.
"Upper" means that you should start at the top and push the bow, and "lower" means that you should start at the loop (which is where the hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow generally produces a sweeter sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more assertive.
You may take your own notes, but remember that the printed slurs are there for musical purposes, so they should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrified, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage fully open.
In a moment, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles before the horrified Queen.
The costs of the American imperialist war to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a significant portion of expenses, and bond interest was floated on the stock exchange in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Certainly, the super-profits realized from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main profits of American imperialism.
Someone needs to understand the circumstances that prompted the creation of the order in order to understand the Templars.
The era in which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (the years 1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, ranging from technological impetus or the necessity of technology to the narrow understanding that human destiny is guided by a basic logic linked to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two main ideas in common: that technological development progresses on its own path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
Someone might say, for example, that the automobile necessarily leads to the improvement of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically fruitful for only a small number of vehicles, therefore new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Widespread vehicle ownership also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a pronounced element of cultural determinism, brought about by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures arose that were connected to that geography, and, since they were in harmony with the land and society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is distinguished as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around the year 400 AD and lasted until around the year 1100 AD.
His position declined during the twelfth century, especially due to the fact that the crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were more valued than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris also took place.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can remain 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, which came as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is farming that is practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses native seeds combined through crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this situation continues to persist in many developing nations.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel disregarded by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the ethnicity, age, location, class, and/or gender of their members.
The distinguishing criteria of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender-based, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often display their membership by using style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon, in a distinctive and symbolic way.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized with adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "feral" or primitive. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually by their parents); this abandonment of the child was in some cases due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have been the victims of severe child abuse or trauma before abandonment or removal.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child manifests behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to that of the particular caregiver animal, such as their fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, "Scaffolding" supported learning takes it a step further.
The scaffolding method is not a learning method, but rather a supporting tool that provides assistance to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, meaning a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the little man in the form of a paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is adopted by the software and aims to investigate, encourage, and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling alone.
Children are sent to children's homes for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should ever be raised in an environment that is not encouraging, kind, and educational, but they are being raised that way.
We consider the Foster Care System a safe zone for these children.
Our care system is expected to provide loving caregivers, safe homes, secure healthcare, and continuing education.
The care is supposed to provide all the missing necessities from the home where they were previously.
The internet intertwines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the internet lead to other dimensions regarding access for uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important incentives to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects related to motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they observed how audiences reacted to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries for explaining micro-expressions and facial movements that last for only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can discern if a person is lying through the accurate interpretation of their facial expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks showed how people unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even thought that animals, such as domestic dogs, might also have such abilities to explain human behavior.
Twentieth-century studies have proven that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
Isolation and recombination repeatedly shuffle variation between the two groups with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid needs through plant sources in the savanna.
Furthermore, failure to achieve this has serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant resources most easily obtained would be proteins derived from leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting them unless they are cooked.
Conversely, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easier to digest, but also provide large amounts of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved "their protein problem" to some extent much as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking yourself up during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using an alarm clock with a relatively low volume to bring you to your senses without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself snoozing the alarm, you could put it on the other side of the room so you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based tricks include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep to force someone to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and spirit.
With the lowering of tension, the current life force increases. Every individual has the opportunity to find peace and absolute satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that prevents this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was further enriched by the "path of love" theological thought of Mahayana and more techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. Through the visualization of certain deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, bringing cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process, and culture led to the states' discord.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had become enemies, and thus the Cold War began.
It would continue for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the Eastern Polish regions, violating the Peace of Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is currently the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and people across the ocean.
The task of naval fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to come to the aid of Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet was trying to stop the traffic, mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably would have managed to conquer Britain, just as it had happened with other countries in Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other pastures, often under the care of goatherds who were usually children or adolescents, more or less the same as the more well-known shepherds. These methods of livestock keeping are still used today.
Wagonways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carts consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them for achieving greater speeds and for hauling larger loads than on the somewhat more difficult roads of that time.
The sleepers were put in place quite early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a sheet of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron wore out the wooden wheels of the wagons more.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The earliest known means of transportation was walking; people began walking on foot two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Adaptations for bipedalism have been found in australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living by respecting the environment more, we can participate in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is like treating the symptoms. However, we need to find the cause of the problems and deactivate it if we don't just want a temporary solution.
It is very clear that the world has undergone major changes due to humanity's advancements in science and technology, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
Following its approval on July 4th by the Congress, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent several blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document took place on July 8th by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it on July 9 before his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Broadsides known to exist to date are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things regarding birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have clawed feet and scales, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex dinosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and in computer language, these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis might not be made.
The presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals can be the clearest sign of poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term beetle in its official sense.
This term originates from the historical similarity to bedbugs, which are highly adapted insects that parasitize humans.
Like assassin bugs, bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or shelter of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), thus remaining the most significant neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple might decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples may decide to prepare an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
But she is not the only one; scientific study is also guided by experimentation, and the experiment is the proof used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in every scientific matter, including psychological ones.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself disconnected from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many rhythms observed in connection with physiology and behavior often depend primarily on the presence of endogenous cycles as well as their production by biological clocks.
For most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, rhythms have been documented that are not simply a reaction to intermittent external cues.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that will maintain a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses, or phages, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can bring about a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material that has been affected, and whether the cells that have been affected are germline cells.
Only mutations of cells from the germline can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of field activities include fishing, hunting, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying information related to the ecosystem.
One example is the development of visits, photography, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns by car to go to their workplace, and they pass by other people whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth movement of transportation, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Now science shows that the massive carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone has complaints about transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears so many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems cause these annoyances, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic engineering is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate within a consistent time range; therefore, traffic flows can be calculated mathematically with approximation.
To better represent traffic flow, links have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This coordination helps in the planning, design, and use of road facilities.
Among animals, insects were the first to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them to avoid their predators more easily and to find food and mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the length of their body.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), moved around the Earth.
That seems logical, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and the first in terms of width. It circulates 8 times more water than the river that ranks second.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching six miles in width in some places.
Fully 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the construction of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then already more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have had knowledge since antiquity of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as all of these can be found in nature in their original form and are extracted relatively easily from mines using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. Those elements were earth, air, water, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to create everything we see.
Alloys are fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are, without a doubt, also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
In this way, with his invention, the pencil became a good companion for many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the status and uses of the pencil have declined.
People now type messages on computer screens, with no need to ever use a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes out.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that the fusion of several protons and neutrons into a nucleus requires energy.
Like hauling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the atom from scratch releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split spontaneously or with even a slight stimulus.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side of the moon.
It is thinner under the dark maria areas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
There might be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. The lava had an easier time rising to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what makes people choose or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they harbor within themselves as they progress into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people desire the things they desire, and what things in their environment will push them to do, or not do, certain things.
Two widespread theories about motivation are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unusual decisions, imposing disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, and assigning individual tasks and responsibilities.
On the other end of the spectrum, such a person easily transforms into someone unrecognizable, who thinks that he or she needs to change everything the team has done and appropriate it as their own.
Ultimately, the leader bears the ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure.
Often, this behavior causes division between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some slight differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their direct, physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local administration.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The Invisible Team" is the management team to which every member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional sectors of an organization, creativity and ability can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a regenerative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical treatment of cognition research. As a result, they narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The reciprocal relationship between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their studies.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain functions of the mind.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has gained strong nuances in science fiction literature, artificial intelligence constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, scheduling and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have been transformed into distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions for real-life problems.
Artificial Intelligence is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been incorporated into several software applications for personal computers and video games.
Excursions occupy a large part of any teaching methodology. It often happens that a teacher expresses the desire to send her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can visit museum artifacts, view an aquarium, or admire fine arts while sitting with their class.
The virtual field trip is also an excellent way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of "Bennet" school in North Carolina create a website dedicated to their trip to the capital, this website is modified every year, but the old versions are still saved online as a memory log.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger is initiating efforts to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more insightful about the world around them." The need to nurture the audience's interests inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond their traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. Through active responses to online materials, students can determine their positions with respect to the writings of others, as well as determine their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive bilingual capital, which boasts a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while the north shelters the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and much more presents Ontario with the elements that are considered by foreigners as the most typically Canadian.
The large areas located further north are very sparsely populated, and some of them are almost deserted and uninhabited regions.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are linked to France and known as luxury beach vacation destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had a major impact on the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they consider harassment, and stalking or grabbing the arm, etc., is not uncommon.
Be decisive when you reject men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (even if it happens because of cultural changes, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazigh fishermen in the 10th century BC and was exploited by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badia, and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of decorations, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Niragongo volcano which covered most of the city's roads, particularly the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, you should research any trips outside Goma to understand the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
In combination with its former inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for remote, exotic places.
Timbuktu is today an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger in 1990, due to the risk from desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special for the Public Broadcasting Service "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in this country, because it has more of an Arab style than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, with Zimbabwe in the north, and its southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² divided into 14 different ecozones, each inhabited by different wild animals.
It is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is called the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks in South Africa, the park has daily fees for entry and conservation.
You might also benefit from purchasing a "Wild Card," which offers entry to any of South Africa's park selections or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place considered the main target by many tourists.
The parade of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a sparkling bar graph, highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, get off the island and go to the Kowloon pier opposite.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the land appropriated by British colonizers, therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is the right place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast across the Bengal and Indian coastlines.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest in the Indian part is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not simply mangrove swamps; they encompass some of the last remaining patches of the great jungles that once covered the northern Indian valley.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², approximately one-third of which is covered by water/marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers in the area, and around 30,000 deer have also been encountered.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
It is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most of the regions receive services from small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Taking taxis together is a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapok River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction finished in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully functional in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for survival.
The Chaco region was the settlement of other indigenous tribal groups such as the guaikuru and payagua, who secured their livelihood by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called the "Giant Province of the Indies," was created as a result of the confrontation between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous native groups.
The Spanish were the ones who began the period of colonization, a period that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Canitas.
Here you can see smaller tours and matches even at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy polo match tickets, go to the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is fixed and equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and United States currency may be accepted. Check with owners in advance to determine what form of payment is accepted.
Outside the islands, it's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency, so break your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can have a deceiving chill: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer reading indicates.
There is no particularly "rainy" or "dry" season: the rainfall level is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how gentle they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack you.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These are wild animals, large and potentially dangerous, and for this reason, you should give them the necessary space.
Besides this, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia, founded in the 1850s, has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence efforts organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the main leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches and safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of "Tamaki Drive" are in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes overcrowded, with numerous shops lining the shore. You can swim safely.
The main beer in the country is "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but it's refreshing and pleasant. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines are easier to find.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "plain white" coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an "espresso," a cappuccino is served covered in cream (and not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but wonderful.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the forest, and damage to the forest from any of these causes is rare.
But again, respect the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of the 1770 bay. Occasionally they may appear outside of this period as well.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their primary habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Making a reservation in advance allows the traveler to rest assured that they will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Often, travel agents have deals with particular hotels, although you may find that booking other types of accommodation, such as campsites, is possible through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation arrangements, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or secure other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, any changes or requests must first go through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp in the same location, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the activity, you'll need to go early to find a campsite near the music.
Don't forget that, even if the music might have ended on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until the late hours of the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic during winter, check where your cabin is located, as the movement on the ice causes a very frightening noise for those who are more sensitive.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Typically, windows and clocks are missing, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and keep them on their premises.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who drives a vehicle in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider that there may be snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low, and you cannot steer the vehicle as if you were on clear asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or windblown snow, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the main element of tourism attraction in Africa and the most special moment for many visitors.
The term safari, in common usage, refers to overland journeys to observe the wildlife and stunning landscapes of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, usually approach cars, and with standard equipment, you will be able to have a better view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you might see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or simply "walking") consists of walking, lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies related to the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
It is expected that most of the event tickets will be priced from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, with typical tickets priced around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to lend you, even if there isn't one in the room.
If you don't have an iron or don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it's enough to boil the water for a minute, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters have different effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals they are not familiar with in the regions where they live.
Parasites can damage food, cause skin irritations, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force do not generally qualify as detrimental.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain countries.
Travelers headed to high-tax countries can occasionally save a fairly significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The road segment between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often traversing isolated stretches of virgin forest.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns prevail.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than in other circumstances.
Surprisingly, the cell phone service is much stronger here than along other parts of the road, for example in the "Pennsylvania Wilds."
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are very diverse and varied, just like those of their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, starting with apple pies, which are baked throughout the year, and continuing with plum pies, which are baked in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other dried fruits. Typical types of cake go very well, especially with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try those which, depending on the region, are called berliner, pfannkuchen, or krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices together with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be "dry" or "liquid", depending on the amount of liquid.
In curry, yogurt is generally used in the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a blanket term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, the term aims to imply foods originating from the central and eastern areas of the main island of Java if used without other qualifiers.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, features a variety of simple, spiced dishes, where the predominant flavorings favored by the Javanese are: peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but can be a safety concern due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse leaves. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most motorcyclists wear boots with heels and a smooth, very narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite cliffs.
The peaks offer stunning views from the ridges. Climbers from every corner of the world are constantly trying new routes among its faces with endless possibilities.
Snow sports on hilly terrain, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many admirers, who are sometimes known as "ski nomads," whose only vacation objective is to ski in a specific place.
The idea of skiing is extremely old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, alpine skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first ski training club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
He has connections, but they don't usually involve alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, where the latter are developed on steep terrain and require much stronger skis and boots.
Think of a ski tour itinerary as a similar hiking itinerary.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than by walking, but you will very rarely reach skiing speeds on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many states would require visa applications and multiple passport checks.
However, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you don't leave this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply separately for a visa in each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There is no general definition of which manufactured articles are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antique.
This definition varies geographically, where the age limit may be lower in countries like North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts can be considered antique, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many people in other professions.
Although traditionally not all Sami were heavily involved in reindeer husbandry, but lived off fishing, hunting and such, they mainly used reindeer as draught animals.
Today many Sami work in modern crafts. Tourism brings significant income to Sapmi, the Sami area.
Even though it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is usually considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you are traveling to, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of other governments, but those are tailored for their own citizens.
To give an example, American citizens may encounter different circumstances in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisory notices are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a state.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information provided elsewhere.
"Severe weather" is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious disruption to social life, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can be encountered all over the world, and there are different types of it that can be conditioned by geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
The forms and consequences of severe weather are strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and fires, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts and cyclones.
Severe weather conditions, both regional and seasonal, include flurries, snowstorms, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any dangers from the severe weather affecting their area, as this may impact their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a place that could be considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
A quick internet search for "Hostile Environment Training" might help you find the address of a local company.
A course will normally treat all the issues discussed here in much more detail, generally with practical experience.
A course will typically be 2-5 days long and will include role-playing, plenty of first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the desert are common, but publications that deal with war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender declaration (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents also varies greatly.
After 9/11, security checks have become much more annoying.
Transgender people pre-surgery should not have to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being violated.
Rip currents are return flows from waves moving away from the shore, often in a groove or something similar.
The underwater topography causes the return flow to concentrate in some deeper parts, and a rapid current can form there towards the deep sea.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and if they've seen you, perhaps it's best to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock happens faster than culture shock (has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapted easily to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of the customs from your home country's culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, as they knew that travelers need to adjust to a new place.
People may not expect that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The light and sound show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
Before the show starts, you can view the pyramids in silence and darkness.
You usually always hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is exactly like a storybook.
The Sphinx is placed as a backdrop and narrator of a long history.
The scenes show the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are subject to claims by several nations, and have a high concentration of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano offers an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region in the south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here on the plateau and then reappear to form a 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote locations with no cell phone signal, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot generally replace a mobile phone because you need to be outdoors with an unobstructed line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as by expeditions that require remote data and voice calls.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to provide additional information about connecting to this service.
A more and more popular option for those planning a gap year is travel and learning.
This is especially favored by those who leave school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education when you return home.
Generally, a school fee will be required for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a very good destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on these lakes and archipelagos.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is considered a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but, apart from them, it's something quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this figure is one in forty).
Most of the special cruises in the Baltic have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days, while returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go to shore on boat trips, you won't need a special visa (since 2009).
Some cruise lines in their brochures feature the German city of Berlin. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, so a visit to this city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things that many, many people have.
For some, a certain understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help them overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or not having things under control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly. Time is often very important for work documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some lines, the largest companies have their own planes, but it was a problem for other lines and smaller companies.
If they were to send the goods by air freight, some routes could take days to go through the unloading and customs clearance process.
The only way to get them through faster would be to send them as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow sending luggage without passengers, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class or business class is to amass a large sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, have the company do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rough general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times as much for first class!
Usually, it's not even worth asking for a price reduction for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a specific handful of passengers who willingly pay high prices to have the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The native language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
This conflict led in 1994 to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religious belief in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a fairly good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it has now transformed into a bustling, modern, and developed commercial center, sprawling on a large gulf and surrounded by mountains.
Amidst wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers, traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches are scattered, although the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby Eysturoy island and has a peculiar octagonal church.
Above the graves in the churchyard, there are some interesting sculptures, in the shape of doves, made of marble.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk through the intriguing village.
To the north and very close by is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, which became famous to foreigners after a vivid account of its beauties, written by Lord Byron.
The 403 bus of "Scotturb" goes regularly to Sintra, with a stop in Cabo da Roca.
Also, head north to the magnificent Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (shrine), a site of Marian apparitions renowned worldwide.
Please remember that you are, in effect, visiting a site with mass graves, as well as a place that holds almost unparalleled significance for a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived the times that passed here, and many others whose loved ones were killed or worked there to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Show the dignity, solemnity, and respect that this object deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the appearance of the building by making notes or graffiti on these structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
Regular announcements in the subway are made only in Catalan, but for unscheduled disruptions, announcements are made by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, harsh, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as possible, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make it easier for you to get along.
The Parisians' harsh exterior will quickly soften if you display some basic good manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forests, mainly beech, coniferous pine, and fir trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a particularly large variety of plant communities, due to his range of microclimates, dissimilar soils, and varying altitudes.
The region is also the habitat of a very large number of animal and bird species.
There, one can find a rare animal world, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women should wear skirts below the knee and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries offer headscarves for women who don't come prepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the spare trousers at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after every user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these baggy trousers. One-size-fits-all for men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and relies heavily on olive oil.
A simple, typical dinner in the area, especially during the summer, is "Pa amb Oli": bread with olive oil, tomato, and any other available ingredient, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns near the word "Sie", which means "you", always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although the writing is a bit complicated due to the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
In Italian, pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are 'c' and 'g', since their pronunciation changes based on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce the single "r" and the double "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means cart.
Persian has a grammar that is somewhat simple and generally regular.
For this reason, if you read this practical grammar, you will be able to learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand its expressions.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, you'll learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish might jump to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is very similar, so there's no need to study it separately.
Medieval observatories are now mostly defunct and used as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem in their day as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, where they are easier to get to than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are very large facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as "hanami," has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The notion came from China, where the plum blossom was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor himself only for him and other members of the aristocracy in the imperial court.
Plants look much better when they are in their natural environment, so don't be tempted to remove even a single "sample".
If you visit a garden arranged according to rules, even collecting "samples" will undoubtedly get you kicked out.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe and very easy place to get around, and you can buy almost anything when you arrive there.
But since it is located in the "northern tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with either the heat (always) or the strong sun (less often, when the sky is clear).
There are also some buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take goes inside Hebron, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to build a holiday around.
For example, by visiting the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or by taking cruises to interesting places on the Danube, or by sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also mark routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may very well be a pre-Christian ritual for spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into celebration as soon as midnight strikes to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
After the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals also arrived there, including horses, cows, goats, cats, dogs, and rats.
If you take a trip to the Antarctic or Arctic regions during winter, you will enjoy the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the polar auroras, as the sky will be dark almost all the time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is low and usually not a problem, so you will be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group efforts instead of praising individual achievements.
Often, workers must obtain the approval of their superiors for every decision they make and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
