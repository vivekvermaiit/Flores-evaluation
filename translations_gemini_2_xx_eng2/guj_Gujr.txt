This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but also provides information from the fossils that is not usually available, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that this animal had feathers that were brownish-tan on the outside and light or yellow on the inside.
This discovery also provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of birds' feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed, slender shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers hypothesized that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers have suggested that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen appears to be from an adult, rather than a juvenile.
Researchers suggest that even though this was a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows that these are adult feathers, not the feathers of a baby chick.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was written to replicate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be due to the forces flowing between the galaxy's dark matter and the galaxy's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a force on the Earth, resulting in tides, similarly the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists have successfully calculated that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This principle states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a type of halo around the galaxy, and it is made up of many small particles.

Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested 5 people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although 3 people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, and the driver of the red Audi TT was rescued by emergency services.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was eventually transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja had been accusing her son of murder in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then.
He has been detained and is awaiting indictment and trial by the court, but there is likely to be no eyewitness testimony because his image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have viewed the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Dundee University professor Pamela Ferguson notes that "journalists appear to be walking a dangerous line if photos etc. of suspects are being published."
The Crown Office, which has overall control of the investigation, has told reporters that no comment will be made until an indictment is made.
This document, according to Likud, will refer to the border dispute based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war, which Palestine desires.
Other issues known to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Following the signing of the agreement, Israel is demanding to maintain its military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years, while the PA is only willing to agree to such a presence for five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control trial were meticulously observed by the rangers as the trial was regulated and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS's Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Cultural Heritage, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received extensive security and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martell's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelli reacted with the commission regarding the anti-government protests that began in October.
Violent protests erupted due to the failure to hold elections after 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning and overheating iPods were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, Meta announced that Apple had reported 34 instances of overheating to them, which the company called "non-critical."
The ministry responded to Apple's decision to postpone the report by saying it was "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19:00 GMT).
The Northern Marianas' emergency management office reported that no damage was reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Filipino photographers and 6 hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first.
The photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Leggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Despite working at a hospital, Ligins began investigating premature labor in her spare time.
Their research revealed that if hormones are administered, the lungs of the fetus develop more quickly.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna passed away between two moons. Absolutely uniquely captivating like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna was just as eccentric as me....maybe even more so....love her and miss her.....hopefully she is in a better place."
In a poll of 1,400 voters conducted before the 2010 federal election, opposition to an Australian republic had risen by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the voting hold the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the peak of voting, the survey revealed that 29 percent of people believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
He is set to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle after winning an Olympic gold medal, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but there are doubts about his fitness due to his complaints.
Because the medicine is prohibited in sports, that pain relief medicine could not be taken.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people had verified the research in early February, using different types of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water and organic material, including proteins, to Earth, potentially supporting the building blocks of life.
Scientists are trying to understand how planets form, especially regarding the formation of Earth, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called those rumors "political gossip and foolishness."
She is likely to run for president in the 2016 election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will allow aircraft to travel shorter distances and reduce carbon emissions by saving millions of gallons of fuel each year.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, so that air traffic controllers can locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no new transport facilities introduced, and overground trains will not stop in Wembley. Car parking and park-and-ride facilities will remain unavailable on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported on the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
A report from Princeton University in America and Uppsala University in Sweden stated that a new species evolved in just two generations, due to interbreeding between the local Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, although it was believed that this process would take longer.
Gold can be molded into all sorts of shapes. It can even be molded into very small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be bent and made into strips. It can be hammered or turned into sheets.
By making it very thin, it can be applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books, known as "illuminated manuscripts".
This chemical is said to have a pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the hydrogen ion concentration (pH) in the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms have 1 proton and 1 electron).
Mix the two powders and then, with clean and green hands, fill the mixture into the ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and create a sort of shield.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet, which was connected to a developed drainage system.
Remnants of ancient drainage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and the houses of Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where women and men used them together.
When you call someone who lives thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and immediately sends it down.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes the views and light there to appear blurry.
A 100-foot tall rocket is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
Wheels have brought about incredible changes in the world. If wheels have given us anything greatest, it is easy and fast transportation.
He gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are mid-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that prey on various small creatures, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of this place, where each cat has a specific job that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups known as prides.
Prides are groups consisting of one to three adult males, dozens of females, and cubs.
Sisters and daughters are a large family, resulting in women being primarily close to each other.
Lion prides function like wolf or dog packs, and other animals behave similarly to lions (excluding other big cats), as they are highly lethal to their prey.
A good all-around athlete, a tiger can climb (though not perfectly), swim, long jump, and pull with 5 times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like the lion's free-sounding resonant roar; rather, it's more like a series of growls and loud, enunciated words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and, if possible, birds. Any animal that an ocelot hunts is much smaller than its own size.
Scientists think that ocelots hunt and find animals (prey) by smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
Because of their night vision, they can see well at night and move stealthily. Ocelots camouflage themselves in their surroundings and then ambush their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from its main group (for example, when they migrate across a mountain or river, or reach a new island from which they cannot return), they find themselves in a new environment that is different from before.
This new environment has different sources and different competitors, so for the new generation to become strong competitors, they will need different skills or adaptations than they needed before.
The core population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same level of conformity as before.
Over time, the new population will begin to adapt to their new environment, and they will look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, two populations of animals that have separated will begin to look different enough that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from trees. A large part of our food comes from trees. Animals cannot live without trees.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared no one except other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaws held over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and the roof of its mouth had an extra set, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We are not entirely sure, but it likely had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it was possibly cannibalistic as well.
Even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex wouldn't have been able to stand against it, attacking any creature that entered the water.
Much of their food would be familiar to us, while the Romans had their share of exotic or unusual banquet items that included wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to eat while standing next to where their wives were.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods that came to Europe from America, or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the god's home.
People would come to God with sacrifices, and priests would try to fulfill God's wishes through rituals and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctum (Garbhagriha) that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers were built as part of temples, which were called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sacred place for God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, owning a home wasn't particularly important.
A large part of the Jewish family's life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyards; the storage areas were open counters visible from the street. Houses were built using stone.
The land of Canaan did not have any significantly large forests, so wood was very expensive there.
Greenland was settled sparsely. The Norse sagas recount that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, after sailing further west, found Greenland and named it so.
But disregarding their discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Despite each country being 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie called National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although, that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence, these words are written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". This text appears at the bottom of the document.
No one knows who wrote it, it is known that initially, the large leather parchment documents (measuring 293/4 inches by 241/2 inches) were rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is possible that the notation was only added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by "Vichy" French. These were the French people who made a treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces attacked the southern part of France; this invasion was known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live in a society and work cooperatively.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civitas," relating to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and it somehow also defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture means knowledge being passed down through many generations, a cultural heritage, and relentless expansion.
Small cultures largely disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to gain recognition as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—whose sole component was the Congress—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state officials to do all its work, who did not always cooperate.
He had no right to override tax laws and tariffs between states either.
Unanimous consent of all states was required before the amendment could be made to the article, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Along with the German national football team, the Italian national football team holds the second position as a successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. The people of Italy participate in international sports festivals and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the world's seventh-largest island country!
Due to the cluster/group of islands near Japan, Japan is often geographically referred to as an 'archipelago'.
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in indigenous grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it relinquished sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu mainly has 3 structures, namely, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located very close to the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still image photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the final stages of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but, importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, to some extent, confusing, being 36mm wide by 24mm high.
This constitution's ratio (dividing by 12 to obtain a ratio of whole numbers) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common architectures (such as the APS family of architectures) are identical or nearly identical in their aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often trivialized and laughed at, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism when composing an image.
It states that the most effective spot for the main subject is at the intersections of lines dividing the picture vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, European states were interconnected through Christianity over a period of a thousand years.
Everyone, from the king to the common people, was affected by his pervasive power.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are specifically intended for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the doctrine was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of war, Britain blockaded the German Navy.
The strategy proved effective, leading to the cessation of vital military and civilian supplies. However, this blockade was in violation of numerous centuries-old international agreements and generally accepted international laws.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering parts of the sea, creating a risk even for neutral vessels.
Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare, as this tactic had a limited response.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were prevalent sentiments among most nations and citizens.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
They arrived in America with 4 cents to their name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods.
There was an unstable era of provinces divided among each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three States, lasting 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce battles among the nobles for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras, with thousands dying in the fight to sit on the highest seat in the magnificent palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transformation from autocratic rule to democracy, the rise of nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
Besides, after the revolution, employment was available to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful individuals to thrive.
The same was true for the army, because army rankings were now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this physical life. He would frequently go to a cave for meditation, which became known as "Hira" on the "Noor" (light) mountain.
He himself discovered natural caves that had stood the test of time, vividly portraying Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, even if someone knows it exists, it's not easy to find. Once inside the cave, it's complete solitude.
Nothing can be seen except for the beautiful sky above and many mountains all around. From inside the cave, very little of the world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, still standing today, is one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many massive pyramids built in honor of the Pharaohs.
In Egypt's Valley of the Kings, the Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" (which contains the most famous and largest pyramids) is home to many pyramids, numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and colossal sculptures.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The 'upward bow' symbol looks like a V and the 'downward bow' looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing."
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
And the upper arch typically creates a delicate sound, while the lower arch produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can pencil around your own markings, but remember there are also printed bowing marks for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
A frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were chased back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
In a coach, they returned to Paris, and a mob surrounded the King and Queen, threatening and menacing them.
The crowd pressured the king and queen to keep the windows of their coach open.
Once, a member of the mob brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The cost of U.S. imperialism in conquering the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government through Wall Street banking houses to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on liquid bonds in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the excessive profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will establish the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the formation of the order.
The period in which these events occurred is generally known as the High Middle Ages, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, conventionally ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing diverse ideas that, in practice, range from technology-push to the strictly deterministic notion that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic tied to scientific laws and their expression in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies, rather than being internal to social conditions.
For example, someone might say that if there are motor cars, it will be necessary to develop roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also contributes to the increasing number of accidents on roads, which inspires the development of new technologies for repairing physical ailments and treating health issues.
Romanticism contains a broad element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, individuals shaped by geography, and the customs and culture that arose related to that geography over time, were considered better than arbitrarily imposed laws, as these people were consistent with their place in society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation for being a center of prosperity began around 400 BCE and lasted until about 1100 BCE.
His prestige declined in the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the jihadists returned with gifts like silk and spices, which were more valuable than the prices offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
The Byzantine culture in the East heavily influenced dressing styles in the beginning.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western European countries began to develop their own style. As a result of the movement, one of the biggest developments of that time was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is a type of agriculture in which farmers grow enough crops to provide only for the needs of themselves and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, mostly organic, system that utilizes locally adapted, saved seeds and crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this practice still continues in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and provide them with an identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture differently can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashions, mannerisms, and characteristic language.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization draws attention to the unfortunate cases of children who, while growing up, were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are kept confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced excessive abuse or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others are accused of being raised by animals; some are said to live in the jungle on their own.
When a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, their behavior is almost identical to that of their foster parent animals (within physical limitations), such as their fear of humans or their indifference towards them.
When project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding is a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support that helps people who are having a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software, and they are designed to question, prompt, and clarify processes that might be challenging for a student to focus on alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and delinquency.
No child should grow up in an environment devoid of nutrition, care, and education, but they do.
We understand the foster care system to be a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe housing, loving caregivers, balanced education, and reliable healthcare.
It is believed that foster care will meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in the context of the uses and gratifications approach.
"For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995)."
Igami and MacCord (1998), while examining audience reactions to websites, recognized that "personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were also new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial movements that last for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that whether a person is lying or not can be determined by properly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his paper delivered as the Presidential Address, Oliver Sacks indicated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless accurate in making sincere assessments.
They also suggest that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be compared to animals like domesticated dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
With each generation, shuffling for segregation and reunion between two sets is a variation.
In savannas, it is difficult for primates with human-like digestive systems to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Moreover, there are serious consequences to failing to do so: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources may be the readily available proteins in leaves and pods, but they are difficult for human animals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking all things into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna solve theirs today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biological clock include drinking a lot of water before sleeping (especially water or tea, a known diuretic), which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of stress present in their body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive life energy is present. Everyone has the capacity to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve self-realization. The only obstacle to achieving this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana school of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In theory, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It shows the path of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and embracing love.
Kundalini energy (consciousness energy) is awakened through Kundalini Yoga with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and mental visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Deity Yoga. Through visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, the body's energy centers are activated, and wisdom consciousness is created.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to cooperation between America and Russia. With the end of the World War, conflicts of order, process, and culture led the countries towards collapse.
Two years after the end of the war, former allied countries were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought by proxy armies for reality, on battlefields spanning from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had been broken, and the only hope was to reorganize on the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were virtually cancelled overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish agreement, and both unilateral and multilateral treaties, invaded Poland's eastern territories, entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships for freight transport is still the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the seas.
The job of a navy is traditionally to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and things, while also interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and things.
Among the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, in which Americans moved people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allied nations had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain, because it had the rest of Europe with it.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and communities began keeping them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, led mostly by shepherds, often children or adolescents, much like the widely known Bharvad. These animal husbandry methods are still used today.
The construction of wagonways had already started in England from the beginning of the 16th century.
Wagonways had only wooden parallel planks, yet they allowed horses to achieve greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
Very early crossings were introduced to maintain the track. However, it was gradually understood that the track would be more efficient if it had an iron strip on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the cart.
Eventually, wooden rails were replaced by iron rails. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The earliest form of transportation discovered was walking, with humans learning to walk upright around two million years ago through the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning 'upright man').
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as a matter of habit.
Bipedal characteristics are found in the remains of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living a more eco-friendly life, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future troubles to some extent.
Like many cases, this is also a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the disease and try to eliminate it.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of mankind, and problems have increased further due to the growing population and the extravagant lifestyles of mankind.
Following its acceptance by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of this document was given by John Nixon on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall.
It was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy of it reached London on August 10th.
The 25 extant documents of the Dunlop Broadsides are the oldest existing copies. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many stories about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have scales and feet with claws, they lay eggs, and like a T-Rex, they walk on their two hind legs.
Almost all computers in use today rely on the manipulation of information coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only be one of two things, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits - or bits - used for computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not show up immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The presence of open containers of medications or household chemicals can be a strong indicator of potential internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific instructions for first aid for that particular poison.
The term "ant" is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from an age-old familiarity with bedbugs, which are parasitic on humans.
Both mosquitoes and bedbugs are parasitic, living either in their own burrows or in the dwelling of their host.
Across America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research indicates that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
This couple may choose to plan to adopt a child for themselves.
When giving up a child for adoption, the biological parents terminate their rights, so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works through the scientific method. This method truly guides most scientific research.
However, they are not alone; an experiment is used to eliminate one or more potential assumptions. Asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
Nature lovers and philosophers focused on classical texts, and particularly the Bible in Latin.
For all matters of science, including psychology, Aristotle's views were accepted as valid.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself alienated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many apparent rhythms of physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of internal clocks and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not responses to external periodic cues have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks contain self-sustaining oscillators that, even without external cues, run smoothly for a certain period.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key indications that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They performed 2 experiments, labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have varying effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic element, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations occurring in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying natural scenery, including flora and wild fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about ecosystems.
One example is about visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in their cars to go to their workplaces, abandoning others whose workplaces are the very places they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone, in some way or another, is connected to and supports a transport system reliant on private cars.
Science now suggests that this vast carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere from a stable state, which has supported human development for the last two million years.
Every individual is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
Complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rarely heard in developed countries.
Why does the transportation system present the risk of such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers generally drive at a consistent speed; therefore, the flow of traffic remains somewhat moderately uniform and can be represented somewhat mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relations help in the planning, design, and management of roadway facilities.
Insects were among the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they are able to fold their wings back against their body.
This gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold back their wings are termites and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people felt he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and other stars as well).
This is understandable, because he doesn't realize the earth is rotating, so what's happening?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes being six miles wide.
The Amazon accounts for a full 20 percent of all water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, although the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were in awe of the monuments of their ancestors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language used by most people working in the Italian state, while Latin is often used in religious rituals.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these are all found in their native form in nature and are relatively easy to excavate with primitive tools.
Aristotle, who was a philosopher, proved that everything is made up of a mixture of these 1 to 4 elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This substance consisted of four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although they also theorized that they transform into new substances to become what we see.
An alloy contains two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also find alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Everything is made of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is surprisingly so small that millions of them could fit by the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
The sad thing is that as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower position in usage.
People now type messages on computer screens, never coming near a sharpener.
It is a matter of imagination what will happen to the keyboard when something newer than the keyboard comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to bind together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavily loaded cart up a hill. Splitting the seed again releases energy from it.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, meaning they can break apart spontaneously, even with little or no external pressure.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
This crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thin under Maria and thick lower down.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theory focuses on what attracts people's attention or what people are drawn to.
These principles suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internally suppressed until they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about some people that makes them want the work they do, and what in their environment prepares them to do certain tasks, or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum involves trying to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change and make their own everything the team is doing.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often creates disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams also have the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
In many cases, virtual team members act as points of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) was also a unique component of the virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is a management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning institution? One goal of implementing institutional learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the operational departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new creative process to fulfill customer needs.
Before an organization adopts innovation, a conducive environment for innovation should be fostered by appropriate leadership, and the exchange of institutional information and learning should be made easy and natural.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach to help organizations reach higher levels of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to perceptual knowledge; therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more accurate.
The relationship between brain disease and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, wounds, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
With the rise of new technologies, we can see and examine the structures and processes of the brain in ways we have never seen before.
This provides a lot of information and materials for building replica models, which helps us understand the processes of our brains.
Despite its science fiction connotations, Artificial Intelligence is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer issues and answer their questions, as well as signature recognition, voice, and face.
Such matters have become a separate discipline, which focuses on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in some home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often, teachers like to take their students to places where there isn't a bus travel option.
Technology offers solutions featuring virtual field trips. Students can sit in their classrooms and view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or appreciate beautiful art.
Sharing field trip information virtually is a great way to reconsider the trip and share the experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina visit the state capital each year and create a website about it. The website is recreated every year, but its old versions are saved online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can help improve student writing. Students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical listeners, a blog writer tries to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." It motivates students to be clever and interesting in order to cater to the interests and needs of the audience (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond traditional schooling.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical: reacting actively to internet content, students can define their position in relation to the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, boasting magnificent art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
In the far south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to Muskoka and the unspoiled natural beauty beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as quintessentially Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
In the north, large areas have a very low population density, and some are almost uninhabited forests.
The population comparison that surprises people is: more African Americans live in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the biggest continent.
Most small islands are either independent nations or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also spread Islam to various regions, and this occurred on a large scale in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The 15th century marked the beginning of European influence and colonialism in India, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, this area is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: The advice is that any female traveler should say she is married, whether she is married or not.
It also helps in wearing rings (that don't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that what they perceive as harassment may be cultural differences, and following, holding hands, etc. are not uncommon.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's okay).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century by Berber fishermen, and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The city was rebuilt by a Moroccan Sultan and named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trade base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan items like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and djellabas, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried much of the city's streets, especially the town center.
While Goma is adequately secure, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing fighting situation in the North Kivu province.
This city is a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese Francs.
With its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to the risk of desert sand, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders featured it as one of the special wonders of the African world.
This city is quite different from other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic feel than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
This park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main tourist attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like other South African national parks, the park has daily conservation and entrance fees.
Buying a Wild Card can also be beneficial, as it provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa, or even all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
Hong Kong's skyline, formed by a parade of buildings, has been likened to a glittering bar chart clarified by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the very place where the British colonialists established themselves, and so if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast across India and Bangladesh.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
Although the forests are not just mangrove clusters - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered in water/mud areas.
Sunderban has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that the area currently has 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Throughout the day, buses depart from the Inter-District Bus Station (Nadipar), although most people, especially those going towards the east side and Jakar/Bathang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are mostly full, so it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (NU 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers have a height of 83 meters and a length of 378 meters, and both of their roads have a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical and horizontal clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
This bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, which is when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous peoples such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In 16th-century Paraguay, what was previously called the "Vast Province of the Indies," arose from the clash of Spanish conquistadors with native groups.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Canitas polo field.
Small competitions and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for news on where to buy tickets for the tournament and polo matches.
The Falkland Pound (FKP) is the currency of the Falkland Islands, and its value is equivalent to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands in Stanley, just beyond the FIC West Store.
British Pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and credit cards and United States Dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and United States currency may be taken; check with the owners in advance to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
Exchanging Falkland currency outside the islands is almost impossible before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely gets extremely cold, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall remains relatively consistent throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile large animals like wild bulls, deer, and bears may appear, they can attack at any time.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals can be large, wild, and dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that bears and other wildlife are attracted to scents, so avoid cooking or carrying fragrant food, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave the port, the port became the site of the navy's infamous blockade.
All ships except for one British cruiser were sunk. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, a peaceful convention was held in the city as part of a Mao-inspired movement, which resulted in the assassination of Supreme Head of State Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to having two harbors. The most popular are in three areas.
The northern beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All of those beaches are mostly sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them offer shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive is at the Viaduct Harbour in Britomart, Mission Bay in central Auckland, and the upmarket suburbs of St Heliers.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches that have a good selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'; it's not a complex beer, but it's enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Monta".
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more widely distributed.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easier to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a flat white coffee is foreign. A small black coffee is an 'espresso,' a cappuccino comes overflowing with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is pricey but also excellent.
Many reef trips are conducted throughout the year, and injuries on the reef from any of these causes are rarely seen.
Still seek advice from officials, still follow all signs, and pay even more attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found from October to April along the coast and near river deltas north of 1770. During this time, they are sometimes seen out in the open as well.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will flee.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their primary habitat is in estuaries, in the river north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing that once they reach their destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, however, you can also book other types of accommodation like camping grounds through a travel agent.
Travel agents commonly offer packages that include airport transfers, transportation arrangements, or combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the offer for you if you need time to think about it or purchase other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
Any amendments or requests should be processed through the travel agent first, and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most people attending the music festival decide to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
Arrive early to get a campsite close to the music if you want to be close to the action.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stage has likely ended, there will still be sections of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as traveling through ice creates terrible noise for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in port in their itinerary. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check regulations).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They typically offer special meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them on the premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, drinking alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of ice, snow, or freezing temperatures.
Icy and snowy road surfaces have low friction, and you can't drive the same way as you would on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stranded.
Visibility may also be obstructed by snowfall, blowing snow, or even by ice buildup on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is common in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest attraction for travel in Africa and the main trip for many visitors.
The popular meaning of the word "safari" is to travel by land, especially in the savannas (grasslands, treeless plains) of Africa, to see the amazing wildlife.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, at which time standard equipment will make it easier to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or going "footing") involves hiking for a few hours or even several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having previously hosted in 1964.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 2020 before it is declared postponed, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies from late March do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event ticket prices will range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with general tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, whether or not they are present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you simply don't fancy wearing ironed socks, then you can use a hairdryer if possible.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their own regions.
Domesticated animals and birds can spoil food, irritate, or in worse cases, cause allergies, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people, are generally not called scourges.
Duty-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase goods without import duties and taxes at certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont has some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often traversing through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on the country's roads, be careful: sudden grades, narrow lanes, and sharp turns abound.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to it is even more important than it might otherwise seem.
Surprisingly, though, the mobile phone service here is much stronger than in many other parts of the route, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good and, especially in Bavaria, diverse and rich in ingredients, similar to those found in its southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being baked in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts. Often, it is good to pair popular cakes with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but heavy pastry, then try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, as they are called depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, also containing meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, kadhi can be "dry" or "wet."
In North India and inland regions of Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries. In South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Choosing from 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without a preceding qualifier, the term means that this food originates from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features many seasoned dishes with key flavors that include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of fragrant spices.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability to the rider but can raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting trapped.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but lands with one foot in the stirrup while in motion, they can be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most people wear riding boots that are high-heeled and smooth, with very narrow soles.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, features diverse granite big walls and crags.
The mountain range includes amazing views in its peaks. Mountaineers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes on its walls, drawn to its endless possibilities.
Downhill sports, which include popular activities like skiing and snowboarding, involve using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet to glide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," planning entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very old — skiers in cave paintings are from as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia in 1861 by Norwegians.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is associated with alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering but is not usually included; ski mountaineering takes place on steeper terrain and requires more robust skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as you would a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you might cover a little more distance than walking - but you will rarely achieve the speed of skiing from one end of the country to the other on a groomed track without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to different countries often requires going through visa applications and passport regulations.
However, the Schengen area largely functions as a single country in this regard.
As long as you live in this zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each country that is a member of Schengen, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what makes a manufactured item an antique. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
There are geographical variations in the definition, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be considered antique, even though they are earlier in origin than such goods produced in large quantities.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many people who have other occupations.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami are engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but rather derive employment from activities like fishing, often keeping reindeer for specific tasks.
Today, many Sami work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
Although it is widely used, especially in non-Romani contexts, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can take the government's advice in addition to your own, but their advice is formulated for their citizens.
Taking an example, American citizens in Middle Eastern countries face different circumstances than Europeans and Arabs.
Advisories are just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often general and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and has various types, depending on geographic location, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rain, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include snowfall, cold waves, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks affecting their area, as these could impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for "Adverse Environment Curriculum" will likely show the address of a local company.
The curriculum will generally cover all the topics discussed here in more detail, often with practical experience.
Typically, the course will be 2-5 days long and will include role-playing, plenty of first aid, and sometimes even weapons training.
It's common to find books and magazines about surviving in barren wastelands, but publications related to war zones are rare.
Voyagers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have the proper documentation to return.
In cases where the gender is not specified (X) or the documents have not been updated for the desired name and gender, governments' willingness to issue passports varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with these documents is equally varied.
Security checks at checkpoints have become even more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to have their dignity and privacy intact while passing through scanners.
Rip currents are strong, narrow currents flowing away from the shore, often near reefs or similar structures.
Underwater topology causes return flow to concentrate in some deep sections, potentially creating rapid deep-water currents there.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion, which becomes inevitable from trying to swim back against the current.
After you get out of the current, swimming back is usually no more difficult than it normally is.
Try to aim somewhere you won't be caught again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock comes on sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture upon returning home.
Having lived abroad, you've embraced a new culture and lost some habits from your home culture upon returning home.
When you went abroad for the first time, people probably showed patience and understanding, because they know that people need to adapt in a new country.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the children's area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can always hear the sounds of tourists and merchants. The story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set up as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are depicted on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and have a significant presence there, with sixteen active research stations in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano forms a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region located south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau and then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer Ellsworth Mountains range, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
Mount Vinson, the highest mountain in Antarctica, is located in the northern part or the Sentinel Range, with the Vinson Massif mountain reaching a height of 4892 meters.
In remote locations, where cell phone coverage is unavailable, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are not usually a substitute for mobile phones, as you need to be far outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make phone calls.
This service is frequently used in shipping, including Anand Kala, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting with this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is especially popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year before university without interfering with their education.
In many cases, taking a gap-year course abroad can increase the likelihood of returning to higher education in your home country.
Typically, there are tuition fees to pay to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, small boats, or kayak.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with about one boat for every seven to eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, the figure is one to forty).
The most distinctive feature of a Baltic cruise is the extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can spend a few days visiting that historical city and then sleep on the ship on the way back at night.
If you are only taking a cruise to go to the coast, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises have included Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cost of the cruise.
Air travel can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and dislikes that many people have about other things.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on something unknown or something that is not in our control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver items quickly. Often, time is of the essence for business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, it was a problem.
If they had shipped the goods by air freight, it would have taken days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to expedite it was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations wouldn't allow them to ship baggage without a passenger from where you're coming.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to shell out a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times the standard economy fare and eleven times the price for first class for business!
Generally, it's pointless to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on a direct flight from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a specific core group that is willing to pay top dollar for fast and comfortable travel, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the victim of ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-declared Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two parties were re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.07 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide tree-lined avenues, glass-fronted buildings alongside modern shopping centers with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century bazaars, and old mosques and churches are spread out, yet the city's atmosphere feels more Mediterranean European than traditionally Turkish.
From the village of Hvalvík, you can see views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and it has an unusual octagonal church.
Some of the graves in the churchyard have interesting marble sculptures of pigeons on them.
It takes about half an hour to explore this interesting village.

The Scotturb bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also visit the Great Sanctuary of Fatima to the north, a world-renowned site of Marian devotion.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that a significant portion of the world's population considers almost sacred.
There are still many men and women who survived here, and many others whose loved ones were killed or died while working, including Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with complete respect, thoughtfulness, and dignity, as it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by scratching graffiti to mark the structure.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half the population prefers to speak Catalan, most people understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only displayed in Catalan as it is established as the first official language by law.
Still, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but announcements of unplanned disruptions are made in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, through an automated system.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
While this is mostly just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is to be on your best behavior, acting like a ""bien élevé"" (well-behaved) person. It will make your stay much easier.
If you show some basic courtesy, the Parisian's outward rudeness will quickly evaporate.
Plitvice National Park has dense forests, mainly composed of beech, spruce, and fir trees, and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Its microclimate, diverse soils, and varying levels of altitude contribute to it having a particularly wide variety of vegetation communities.
This area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie are also found there, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries, women who arrive unprepared are provided with clothing, but if you bring your own, especially one that is brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will greet you with a smile.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
These clothes can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but they are not washed after each user's use, so perhaps you won't feel comfortable wearing this skirt. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine is based on Mediterranean bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
Especially in the summer, a popular dinner is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and available toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
For you, all nouns with the word Sie always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between certain verbs and nouns.
It makes reading easy, although writing is a bit complex because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in its base form or in a derived form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The key letters to watch out for are C and G, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, make sure to pronounce the name as 'Karo' and 'Karro'; Karo means dear, while Karo with a double 'r' means chariot.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, by reading this grammar primer, you will be able to learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Observatories from pre-modern times are generally not in use today and exist only as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't as much of a problem as it is today at its peak, they were typically located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are vast facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The practice of viewing cherry trees in bloom, known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept actually comes from China, where plum blossoms were a flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural setting, so resist the urge to remove even "just 1" specimen.
"If you get kicked out for visiting a formally arranged garden and collecting 'specimens,' that too without any discussion."
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
However, north of the Equator, after being placed in the "High Tropics," you'll have to contend with both heat (always) and intense sun (when the sky is clear, which is more often than not).
Some buses are going north to Hebron, which, biblically speaking, is the traditional burial place of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and doesn't just go to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba nearby.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for holiday activities.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley, interesting examples on the Rhine Valley or the Danube, or taking a cruise for boating on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
For Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important festivals, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions surrounding the holidays have been adopted in Christian countries by non-believers and non-Christians around the world as well.
There is a tradition of waking up on Easter night at an open stage to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may perhaps be a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
More traditional churches hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, with congregations often participating in a service around midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived here by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not travel, making this giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
After the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals were introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun never rises above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark almost all the time.
These areas have low population density, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, so you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and systematic than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are common business attire, and colleagues address each other by their first names or titles.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, where emphasis should be placed on the collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
