In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC shopping channel.
Ring also settled a lawsuit with a rival security company, ADT Corporation.
While an experimental vaccine has emerged capable of reducing Ebola mortality, to date, no medication has been clearly demonstrated adequate for treating existing infections.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicate that it had less benefit than preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the US Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, may be better served if we move forward with significant change within our organization, rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can clarify how abuse of that proportion described so courageously by survivors of Larry Nassar could go unnoticed for so long and embraces any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal - to make the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor and later for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.
During the 1976 election, he advised Carter on foreign policy, and later served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has already spread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
Discoveries also provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed central shaft, called a rachis, but do have other feather characteristics — barbs and barbules — researchers deduce that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development posterior to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather in temperature regulation or display. Investigators suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not that of a chick.
Researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded at a police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, early yesterday, killing two officers and injuring more than twenty-eight people.

It was discovered that the Sun functions on the same basic principle as other stars: it was verified that the activity of all stars is driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

He encouraged developing countries "to avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later."
He added that "it should not be asked, however, to assume an obligation that goes beyond the stage of development, responsibility and capacity."
The Iraq Study Group presents its report today at 12:00 GMT.
Nobody can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this moment will stop sectarian warfare, escalating violence, or a slide towards chaos.
The report begins with an appeal for an open debate and the formation of a consensus in the United States regarding policy for the Middle East.
The report is severely critical of almost every aspect of the Executive's current policy regarding Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for seems to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and it is made up of many tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that a new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the high mortality rate."
Some patients may have caught the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were healthcare professionals from the hospital.
In a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in all groups of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any specific time in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate their heads in a voting booth, they put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
The French electoral law codifies procedures in a fairly rigorous manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes have been added except those of voters duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. At night, votes are counted by volunteers with strong supervision, following specific procedures.

Four skiers from the women's sit-ski group failed to finish their race, and 45 out of a total of 117 Giant Slalom skiers did not achieve a classification in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police recover stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have already arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their face covered.
Despite the fact that three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
Meanwhile, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of killing his son.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness could be tainted because his image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and the court has considered publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, observes "it seems that journalists are walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for judicial processes, told journalists that no further comments would be made, at least until charges are brought.
The document, according to information leaks, refers to border disputes that Palestine claims based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the West Bank.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
Pesticide applicators in the supplementary pest control trial should be closely supervised by forest rangers, as the trial is being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters' Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited within the framework of the Sporting Shooters' Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage for the Park and NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed instructions and safety training.
Martelly swore in yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous NEC as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
That commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
These protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the non-holding of elections, some of which were overdue since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods overheating due to a defect have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported more than 34 incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responds by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
Earthquake hits Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office says that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he stormed their tour bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fires his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have already been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman, as she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was bailed out.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and he embarked on a career in medicine.
The way he worked as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland Maternity Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature birth during his free time.
Research shows that if a hormone is given, it accelerates the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reports that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, the "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Fellow free fight comrades also pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique like her. Strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was just as weird as me...maybe even more...I love her and I miss her...I hope she is in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of participants in the survey shared their opinion, but they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the latest poll results, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and at three Community Games centers, but due to complaints, their fitness is in doubt.
He can't take the medication he needs to relieve his pain, because it's prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and a professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly have been a source of water supply for Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are hoping to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, taking into account that comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his governorship at the beginning of this year and he signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to those rumors as "political chatter and foolishness."
It is speculated that he may run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to travel on shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel per year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older, land-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No other transport besides trains can go under the ground to Wembley and car parks and pick-up/drop-off stations are not available above ground.
The risk of lack of transportation raises the possibility of the game being forced to be behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process took much longer, due to reproduction between a Darwin's endemic finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be stretched to make a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled to make sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical product. It is possible to make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or (alkaline) basic the product is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electron (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Grind the two dry powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
That moisture on your hand reacts with the outer layer of your skin, which looks a bit strange and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also present in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women would be together in the same place.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back down again, almost immediately.
A satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has already changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
Bring us trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Their young are more slender and of medium size that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including stray cats) that eat small prey much more often, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a specialized job that each cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
The lion is the most social feline that lives in large groups called prides.
A pack has one to three adult male relatives, together with about thirty females and offspring.
Normally women are closely related to each other, forming large families of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves a lot like packs of wolves or dogs, they are surprisingly social animals like lions (but not like other big felines) in behavior, and also quite deadly to their prey.
Like a well-prepared athlete, a tiger can climb (but not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with a force five times greater than a strong human being.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger isn't a full, deep roar like a lion's; it's more like a phrase of words growled and shouted.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost every animal that the ocelot hunts is much smaller than itself.
Scientists have found that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their environment and then jumping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (like if they go over a group of mountains or a river, or if they go to a new island so they can't easily return), often they are in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors; therefore, the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what was needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they started to look less and less like other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations have such a different appearance that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, release).
Plants make their food in the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses with plants and we make our clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
Mosasaurs were apex predators of their time, so they weren't afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
The complete jaw was studded with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the roof of the mouth, which meant that nothing that passed that way would escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't handle it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and the women ate food seated on chairs, rich men liked to have banquets together where they sat side-by-side while they had their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came from the Americas or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a main temple that was considered the home of the god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through these ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then a sanctuary inside that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The hilltop was a special sanctuary for that god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, that house wasn't that important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family happened outdoors.
Women cooked in the yards; shops were just balconies facing the street. Stone was used for house construction.
There are no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was colonized very little. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red, exiled from Iceland for homicide, while traveling west, found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.

If you've already seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Meanwhile, that's not true. Despite there being something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written in verse on the Declaration of Independence were the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776”. This text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that, at the beginning of its life, that large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French "Vichy". These were French who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of waging war against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, that invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civilis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also defines, in some way, a dimension of society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across various generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and fair dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and they fail to be recognized as adequate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as it had no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
He also did not have the authority to abolish laws and tax rates between states.
These Articles required unanimous consent of all States before they could be altered, and the states were not bound to the central government in such a way that their representatives were almost always absent.
The Italian national football league, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and it was the FIFA World Cup Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago".
The origin of Taiwan began in the 15th century, when European sailors who were passing by the island recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the production practices of indigenous cereals and employing Chinese laborers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government of China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the tip of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and that restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but, more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually quite confusing, it's 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is, therefore, referred to as 3:2.
Mountains shaped like (APS format families, for example) are equal to or closely approximate the proportion of this aspect.
The rule of thirds, though often abused and sometimes ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and maintains a measure of order within an image.
He affirms that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, became subject to control.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European States despite differences in language and customs.
If omnipotence affects everyone, from king to commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money leads many people to question whether its principles were being followed.
Soon after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proves to be effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite the blockade violating generally accepted international law, codified by many international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mines international waters to prevent the entry of any ships into all those sections of the ocean, and ends up endangering even neutral ships.
Having seen a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitude of the majority of citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a different dynasty.
Also, within each dynasty there was instability and division of provinces. The best-known period of this was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which occurred for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During this period, there were violent wars between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit in the highest place of the grand palace in Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates in order to allow the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to troops because instead of troop ranks being based on class, now they are based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working-class people oppressed in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He frequently visited a cave known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The very cave that survived for a long time gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Situated atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, it's not easy to find, even knowing it exists. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
That large pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "arc up" sign looks like a V and the "arc down" sign looks like a staple or a square without its bottom side.
Upwards means that you should start at the tip and pinch the bow, and downwards means that you should start in the middle (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow generally produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to make your marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed score markings are there for a musical reason, so generally they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Therese of 11 years and Louis-Charles of four years) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, all fearful, were forced by a crowd of angry market people from around Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
During the journey, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening against the King and Queen.
A crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
At one point, a member of the crowd impaled the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The expenses of the American imperialist war in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
He was forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
It is clear that these super-profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
That era when those events happened is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, that period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological impulse or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and the manifestation of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, for its part, has inherent "effects" on society, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that car driving necessarily leads to road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable just for a few cars that can be counted on one hand, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass use of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time customs and a culture related to this geography emerge, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusades returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valued than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the era, as a result of the crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native seeds from the ecoregion stored along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same mentality who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be different because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or sex of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture frequently signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to describe the importance of socialization is to take advantage of the few unfortunate cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
These types of children are called "feral" or "wild." Some feral children have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of these children occurs due to parental rejection of pregnancy or a child's intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have suffered abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are allegedly created by animals; some are said to live in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of that particular animal species, such as its fear or indifference to living beings.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the assistance goes a step further.
Assistance is not a learning method, but rather a help that provides support for individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a computer program or starting a new project.
Assistance can be both virtual and real, that is, a professor is a form of assistance, but that paperclip man in Microsoft Office is too.
The Virtual Assistant is embedded in the software and it serves to ask questions, suggest and explain procedures that may have been a challenge for a student to deal with on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even abandonment.
Children should never have to grow up in an environment that is not welcoming, caring, and educational, but they do.
We understand that the Family Foster Care System is a safe zone for these children.
Our family foster care systems must provide safe homes, loving care, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Family foster care must meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were removed in the first place.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet lead to more dimensions in terms of uses and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "relationship continuity" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's reasons for using websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can know if someone is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "Presidential Address," he indicates how people who are unable to understand discourse due to brain damage are nevertheless capable of assessing sincerity with precision.
He even suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Studies from the 20th century have already shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Failing that, if it's not achieved, there will be serious consequences: lack of growth, malnutrition, and even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources provide accessible proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
When everything is considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking yourself during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you realize that you restart your alarm clock during sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up and turn it off.
Other strategies based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces someone to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positively the life force presents itself. Everyone has the potential to find peace and absolute contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only things that block the path to this goal are our own tensions and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of total love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is the Yoga of the Deities. Through the visualization of many deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of light is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and America. With the end of the war, confrontations of systems, processes, and cultures led to the fall of countries.
With the end of the war, former allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last 40 years and be fought seriously, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
Around September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
Meanwhile, this plan became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport merchandise is undoubtedly the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's job has always been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to deploy its people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to deploy their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using more U-shaped boats, was trying to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have managed to conquer Great Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them to facilitate access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually put in herds that roamed the mountains and other pasture areas, often herded by goat keepers who were often children or adolescents, like the more well-known cattle herders. These livestock raising methods are still used today.
Caravels built in England arrived at the beginning of the 16th century.
Even though those carriages were made only of wooden planks side-by-side, the horses managed to pull them to reach greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Crossings were introduced quite early to keep the track in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had iron strips on top.
This has become common practice, but it also causes more wear and tear on the wagon's wheel axles.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron carriages were introduced.
The first known transportation was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, didn't walk upright as usual.
Bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists, to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we must look for the root of the problem, and we must deactivate it.
It's quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and problems have become more numerous due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
Following its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten proposal signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and by the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Borda Largu".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
An order for George Washington on July 6th, which he had read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 known copies of the Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of that document. The original manuscript copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs escaped and are still alive today. We call them "pasu".
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
It has feet with scales and claws, it lays eggs, and it walks on its two hind feet like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and this number is referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis may not be made.
A better indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine cabinet or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both, the Assassin Bug and the Bed Bug are nidicolous, adapted to live in nests or in the house of whoever is nesting.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their children, to raise a baby.
This couple can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main objective of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method effectively guides most scientific investigation.
But it's not just that, experimentation, and an experience is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations also guide scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including psychology, were set aside.
As knowledge of Greek fell, the West became isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to periodic external suggestions, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a cyclical period of function freely, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the objective of appreciating the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include hiking, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small outlying areas by car to go to their workplaces, and they pick up other people whose workplaces are where they just left.
With the coming and going of dynamic transport, everyone is in some way linked to a transport system based on private cars, which supports them.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has already displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you almost never hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate these kinds of complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of vehicle drivers between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have some reasonable consistency and can be more or less mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, concession, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helps them escape their enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their body.
This gives them a greater variety of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes with six miles of width.
A full 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their dimensions and in the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a common language used by most of those who work in the State, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People already knew basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from antiquity because they could all be discovered in nature in native form and were relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorizes that they transform into new substances to form things that we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. And of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
Also, you can have alloys that include small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerge, the pencil has been relegated to lower status and uses.
People today write messages on the computer screen, without ever having to get close to a sideboard.
So you can ask what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling an affectionate touch over a mountain. Divide the core eight times, and then release part of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they have a tendency to break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner down by the sea and thicker up in the highlands.
There might be more magma on the side that's closer because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on discovering what makes people awaken or be attracted to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what certain people have to do to make others believe what they want, and what in their environment can make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge as historians begin to lead their former colleagues. One extreme of the spectrum is trying to continue as "one of the friends."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, and assigning responsibilities to people.
On the other side of the spectrum, someone transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has been doing and turn it into their own.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results in conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are maintained at the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but there is a slight difference.
Members of the virtual team often function as a point of contact for your immediate physical group.
They have much more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to custom variable schedules that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable. The invisible team defines standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization? One of the objectives of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized through the functional departments of an organization, creativity and commitment can shine through.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new, innovative process to serve client needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, and also share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that is being used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data presents physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Therefore, it reduces the area of investigation and makes it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of material information to construct simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Despite AI having a strong connotation of science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research on AI involves making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and also handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have now become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now used extensively in areas of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as well as being placed in many home computers and video game software.
A study visit is a big part of any class. Often a teacher likes to take their students to a place where a field trip is not an option.
Technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a study visit is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year that website is remodeled, but old versions are kept online to serve as a memory album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students may begin their blogging experience with dyslexic grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, the blogger started striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
The blog also "forces students to have more knowledge about the world around them." The need to feed public interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; through active response to Internet material, students can define their position in the context of others' writings, as well as outline their own perspective on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada and features a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north is the home of the unexplored natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as something that is considered purely Canadian by outsiders.
The large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited deserts.
For a population comparison, this surprises many people: There are more African-Americans living in America than there are Canadian citizens.
These islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to those lands, and it had a great influence on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe, around the Cape, to India.
In the north, the region is delimited by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: It is recommended that any woman traveling say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps a lot to use a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in saying no, and don't be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city like Daru l-Badya and gave it the name Casablanca for Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, lanterns, and all sorts of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing war situation in the province of North Kivu.
That city is also a base for scaling the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main locations during the PBS's Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" special.
That city is in strong contrast with the rest of the cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic touch than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends to the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is its southern border.
The park is 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and park entry fees.
It can also be good to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that makes up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar graph that becomes apparent with the presence of the water of Victoria Harbour.
For better views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite side of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely populated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place where British colonizers took it as their own, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the Indian interior from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remaining settlements of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/swampy areas.

Otokar buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) during the day, although the majority, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are almost always full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster-brand buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a bridge supported by cables. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, the same month that the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that lived in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish started a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known because it has one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), its value is equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted in most parts of the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also normally accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although they may take British and American currency; check with owners beforehand to find out what method of payment is accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There isn't a specific "rainy" season and "dry" season: the amount of rain continues more or less throughout the whole year.
Although many park animals are used to seeing humans, wildlife is, nevertheless, wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how tame they may seem, bison, deer, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, ferocious, and potentially dangerous, so leave them in their space.
Besides that, be aware that the smell attracts bears and other wild animals, therefore, avoid transporting or cooking odorous foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
That port was the site of a terrible naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, America, and Great Britain refused to leave port.
All ships sank to the bottom, except for that British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the death of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the location of two ports in Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the high-quality suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
This is sometimes a family-friendly beach crowded with a good variety of shops lining the shore. Nothing is certain.
The main local beer is "Number One", it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but wines from New Zealand and Australia can travel better.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you have concerns.
For Australians, the idea of "white white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
That hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive, but excellent.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and collisions due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Even so, heed the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish occur near the sea and river estuaries, from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Yes, sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agents generally offer packages that include coffee, airport transportation arrangements, or even flight and hotel packages all together.
You can also save your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or look for other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests must first be made through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, a large portion of the participants who go to music festivals decide to camp on site, and most participants consider it a vital part of their experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get in earlier so you can get a good viewing spot close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have already ended, there might be festival sessions that continue playing music until the wee hours of the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's location, because crossing ice makes a horrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include a city stay. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and keep them at the establishment.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, being drunk impairs judgment, and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, there's little friction, and you can't drive as you would on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall to trap you in a short time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic almost always continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in popular usage, refers to a land journey to see the dazzling African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and standard equipment closely, allowing for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid, and you observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or going on "foot") consists of hikes, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your plane tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the announced postponement, you may be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies don't extend beyond July 2020, which is when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board ready to lend, even if they aren't present in the room.
If a flat iron isn't available, or if you don't like using tights, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others many minutes are necessary.
Filters vary depending on their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your bottle sealed from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with from their region of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Specifically infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm someone or kill them outright are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without taxes and special consumption taxes in a specific location.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a good amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents more difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which passes mostly through isolated wooded terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: there are many steep descents, narrow lanes, and tight curves.
The speed limits posted are visibly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone service is much stronger here than in many parts of the way, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.

Fruit preserves are common, like apple preserves made throughout the year, and cherry and plum preserves appear during the summer.
Many baked German products also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other dried tree fruits. Popular cakes often combine particularly well with a cup of strong tea.
If you want some sweets, but richer, try some regional specialties called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A caril is a dish made only of aromatic herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.

Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that are attached to each side of the saddle.
It provides greater stability for the rider, but it can have safety issues due to the chance of a rider's foot getting stuck in it.
If a rider falls off a horse, but his foot gets stuck in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs off. To minimize this risk, a set of safety measures can be taken.
First, most horsemen use riding boots with heels and smooth, very narrow soles.
Afterward, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to release from the saddle if pulled backward by a rider who is falling.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cracks.

Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers are dated to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was inaugurated by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It is related, but normally it doesn't involve skiing of the alpine type or alpinism, the latter done on inclined terrain and that requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as an easy hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover distances a bit further than walking - but you will very rarely achieve cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries would mean that you would have to go through many visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen Area, meanwhile, functions somewhat like a single country in that sense.
Glad you're staying in this area; usually, you can cross the border without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a separate visa for each of the Schengen member countries, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition regarding which manufactured items are antiques. Some fiscal agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.

Handicraft products can be called antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sami, and the culture around the trade is also important for other people with other professions.
Even traditionally, despite not all Sámi being involved in large-scale herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer primarily as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern offices. Tourism is an important income source in Sápmi, the Sami region.

Books and magazines that talk about survival in the wilderness are common, but publications that talk about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender confirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documentation for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undesignated gender (X) or updated documents to reflect a desired name and gender varies.

Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are return flows of waves that break at sea, often on a reef or shallow area.
Due to the submarine topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid current to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion when trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Unless you break the cycle, nothing coming back is more difficult than normal.
Try heading for a place where you won't get stuck again, or, depending on your ability and having been noticed, you can hope to be rescued.
Re-entry shock happens earlier than culture shock (has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have an easy adaptation to a new culture sometimes have a particular difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
When you return to your homeland after living abroad, you have already adapted to that new culture and have lost habits from your culture of origin.
When you first go abroad, people are probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.

Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula transition into a plateau, then turn back to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak of 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without cell phone network coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a substitute for a mobile phone, as it needs to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.

Generally, there is a registration fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for a boat trip. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and archipelagos located on the coast.
In archipelagos and lagoons, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelago on the coast and the larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It is on par with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a few days while returning and sleep on the boat at night.
If you are only going ashore during cruise excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not a place near the sea, and a city view is not included in the cruise price list.

Generally, it's not worth looking for discounts for executive or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a good price for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is used everywhere.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations between the two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.

Please treat that place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place by marking or drawing graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
