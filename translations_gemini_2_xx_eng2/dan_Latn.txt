USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the Olympic family's absolute need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that it is in the best interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, to move forward with meaningful changes within our organization rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how such extensive abuse, as described so bravely by the survivors of Larry Nassar, could have gone undetected for so long, and supports all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal — to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowered environment.
In the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor, and subsequently for the administration under Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed rachis, called a feather shaft, but do have other characteristics of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers inferred that the feather shaft was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The removed structure suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers believed that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not chick down.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows an adult individual's plumage and not a chick's down.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same fundamental principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The Iraqi study group presented the report at 12:00 PM GMT today.
It warns that no one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this time will stop sectarian warfare, escalating violence, or a slide towards chaos.
The report begins by calling for an open debate and for the creation of consensus in the US regarding the country's policy towards the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of almost all aspects of the government's current policy towards Iraq, and it calls for an immediate change of strategy.
As the first of 78 recommendations, a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interference and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tidal-like forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the SagDEG galaxy.
The researchers could conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter around a galaxy exists around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of many small particles.
Television reports show that white smoke is coming from the power plant.
Residents near the facility were warned by local authorities to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning, and avoid drinking tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and that there was reason for alarm due to its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital healthcare staff.
In about a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire human group that has tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected people in South Africa at any given time.

The police stated that the body had apparently been lying there for about a day.
The first cases of the disease this season were reported at the end of July.
The disease is carried by pigs and transmitted to humans via mosquitoes.
The outbreak has prompted the Indian government to take extreme measures, such as deploying pig catchers in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying pesticides.
Several million vials of encephalitis vaccines have also been promised by the government, which will help the healthcare system prepare for next year.
Plans for delivering vaccines to the historically hardest-hit areas this year were delayed due to lack of funding and low prioritization compared to other diseases.
In 1956, Słania moved to Sweden, where three years later he began working for the Swedish postal service and became their chief engraver.
He produced over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.
His work is of such quality and detail that he is one of the very few "household names" among philatelists. Some even specialize in simply collecting his work.
His 1,000th stamp was the magnificent "Great Deeds of Swedish Kings" by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl from 2000, which is featured in the Guinness Book of World Records.
He was also involved in the engraving of banknotes in many countries; recent examples of his work include portraits of prime ministers on the front of the new Canadian $5 and $100 bills.

After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods that spread sediment throughout the river stopped.
This sediment was necessary to create sandbanks and beaches, which functioned as a habitat for wildlife and plants.
As a result, two fish species have become extinct and two others are threatened, including the humpback anglerfish.
Even though the water level only rises a few feet after the flood, experts hope it will be enough to restore eroded sandbanks along the river.

All the cave entrances, which were named "The Seven Sisters," are between 100 and 250 meters (328 and 820 feet) in diameter.
Infrared images show that the temperature fluctuations from night and day indicate that they are likely caves.
During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the ground, although they don't behave as stably as large holes on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature throughout the day."
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper, indicating their choice of candidate, in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The procedure is codified very precisely in French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent so that voters and observers can see that the boxes do not contain ballots at the start of voting, and that no ballots are added other than those that are correctly counted and come from approved voters.
Candidates may send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Her first event was slalom, where she did not finish her first run. 36 of the 116 participants had the same result in the run.
In her second run, which was giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a total running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place woman, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's sitting category did not finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 giant slalom skiers were not ranked in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony may be flawed because her picture has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently, and the courts have viewed publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists need to be careful if they publish images of suspects or similar."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be given, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders from before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both countries, as well as issues surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities will only accept leaving the valley in five years.
Shooters in the supplemental pest control trial were to be closely monitored by park rangers, as the trial was supervised and its effect was being evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting Director of National Parks and Wildlife Service's (NPWS) Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEO's resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures intended to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In approximately 60 reported cases, defective iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and resulting in minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they were aware of 27 accidents involving the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management has reported that no damages have been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly individuals, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took an elderly lady's place when she had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Quite unique, just like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as me... maybe even more so... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now."
Out of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this viewpoint and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the various extremes of the vote, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there has been doubt about his condition.
He couldn't take the medication necessary to combat his pain, as it is prohibited during the games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several individuals confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets form, and particularly how Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political drivel and foolishness."
People are wondering if he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year, and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport will be provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available at the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility that they would be forced to play the match behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species developed in just two generations, even though it was believed that this process should have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch Geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into very small forms.
It can be drawn out into a thin cable that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH value. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.

When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster methods of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are several mid-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept, a specific task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides react much like wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete that can climb (though not well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a sentence of snarled, shouted words.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) via smells, by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move around very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from (such as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they can't easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different functions or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than had previously been necessary.
The original population hasn't changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would be helpless against it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate a number of strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large feasts together, where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
They had, for example, neither corn, tomatoes, potatoes, nor cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of their life outdoors.
Women cooked the food in the courtyard; the shops were merely open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled by few people. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived in the area at that time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not true, though. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it's not a tax card.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4th July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it's likely that the note was simply attached as an addendum.
The D-Day landings and the following battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - that is, French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were beginning to focus on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people who live together and cooperate, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; and it also somehow defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-lasting cultural influence, and fair communication.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as the only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, they were dependent on the state governments, which were often uncooperative in enforcing all acts.
Nor did it have the right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history begins as far back as the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island named it Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift in indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) take control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885, Taiwan is declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most widespread film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, which can be confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio for this format is 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (for example, the APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was scrutinized more closely.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European countries together despite different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are used specifically for this purpose.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was being properly adhered to.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from arriving. This blockade was in violation of recognized international laws, codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitudes of most citizens and nations leaned towards pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems, and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were shown in a unique way; each Chinese period of time, or each family that was in power, was a separate dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce war between many noblemen who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not one ruler.
Even after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you're inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE and is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" mark looks like a V, and the "down-bow" mark looks like a staple, or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upstrokes generally produce a softer sound, while downstrokes sound stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the written-in bowing marks are determined by musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming group of people, who shouted threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the mafia presented the severed head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, to the terrified queen.
The war expenses for the American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for the bulk of the expenses, and bond interest ran through the banks on Wall Street in the government's name.
Of course, the super profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that formed the basis for the order's establishment.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that occurred in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, in practice ranging from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws, and the way they manifest themselves in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on societies that is hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the motorized car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many people own cars, there are also more accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare field to heal bodily injuries.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In connection with the Romantic era, it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures arose that were related to the geography, and these were in harmony with the society's location and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known for being an epicenter of luxury from around 400 AD and lasting until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was largely inspired by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time resulting from the Crusades was that people began using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to only meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses saved seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together who feel overlooked by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several factors.
People who belong to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw upon the few unfortunate cases where children, through neglect, accident, or deliberate abandonment, have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been deprived of their freedom by humans (most often their own parents); in some cases, this child neglect was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost identical to the animal that has cared for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn something new - for example, how to use a new computer program or start a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software and aims to question, request, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children enter foster care for a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without nutrition, care, and education, yet they do nonetheless.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
A foster family has the task of providing all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The internet's unique characteristics lead to further dimensions with regard to application and the satisfaction approach.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two distinct pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added through mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations through selection.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human's to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
Furthermore, there are serious consequences for non-compliance: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins existing in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless cooked.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, it also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find that you turn off the alarm clock while you're sleeping, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other circadian rhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, forcing one to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension a person holds in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing standing in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the path of loving-kindness, Mahayana, and with many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. When the war ended, the difference in the countries' system, process, and culture led to the countries opposing each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army occupied and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for freight transport is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the oceans.
The navy's task has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move its people and its goods, while simultaneously affecting your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans attempted to ship soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain just like the rest of Europe.
As far as we know, goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that roamed hills or other pastures, often overseen by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, corresponding to the more commonly known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, cart roads were built in England.
Even though the tracks merely consisted of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the somewhat more uneven roads of the time.
Sleepers were invented quite early to hold the rails in place. Over time, however, it was realized that rails would be more effective if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of metal were used.
The first known method of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations exist in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is like treating the symptoms. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and humankind's extravagant lifestyle.
After Congress approved it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by President of the Congress John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and on July 9th he had it read aloud to his soldiers in New York. On August 10th, a copy reached London.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving edition of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live. We call them birds.
Most people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that are reminiscent of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms like vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This expression comes from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the house or nest of their host.
Across the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child to have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to assume them.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works via the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific investigations.
However, it does not stand alone; experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made within physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural, biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, where they labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, as well as the plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
In the morning, people leave small villages by car to go to their workplaces, and are passed by others whose workplaces are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Science now believes that the decarbonized economy has detached the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a couple of million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study traffic flow because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily evade enemies and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a wider selection of small places to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
There were divided opinions about his theory - some believed he was right, while many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
It seems reasonable, because we can't feel the earth rotating, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It contains over 8 times as much water as the world's second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and in some places it is up to six miles (approx. 9.6 km) wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Although pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in the size of their construction and technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those who work for the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they exist in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are fundamentally mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period that ends this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to most people when it was released.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost status and is used less, since new writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages through computer screens and never need to come near a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down under little or no influence.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more moon gardens on the front side, as the crust is thinner here. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around figuring out what motivates people to act, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
The theories examine what it is about specific people that causes them to perform certain actions, and which elements in their environment cause them to perform or refrain from performing certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can arise when a manager begins to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's successes and failures, after all.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same expectations for expertise are placed on virtual teams as on conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of translating organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and inventiveness begin to emerge when all available resources are used effectively across an organization's functional departments.
As a result, the process within an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, therefore narrowing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies gives us the opportunity to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us plenty of information and materials to build simulation models with, which can help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes being able to create machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into numerous home computers and software applications for computer games.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Quite often, a teacher would love to take their students to places to which it is not possible to travel by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good method for evaluating a field trip and sharing experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is rebuilt, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog's author is beginning to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, "blogging forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active responses to internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written, as well as describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and boasts a number of art galleries and museums exhibiting Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and other areas of untapped natural beauty.
All these things, and more, highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider to be genuinely Canadian.
Further north, there are large areas that are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent in its own right when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape Route between Europe and India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's wise to wear what might resemble a wedding ring (it just shouldn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be pursued, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but it's very touristy.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the city center.
Despite Goma being reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the fighting taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as one of the cheapest places in Africa to track mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Together with the city's relative inaccessibility, this has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special "Wonders of the African World" for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arabic flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, as this either grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider the primary focal point.
Hong Kong's skyline is a cluster of buildings that, through their reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering bar graph.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban development is densely packed onto reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps — they encompass some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered by water/swamp areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the inter-regional bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
As the buses in the district are often full, it's a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Deletaxas are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby locations, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011. It didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant group of indigenous people living in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of native tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "the great province of the Indies," came into being in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous populations.
The Spanish started the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world's best polo teams as well as some of the world's best players.
The year's biggest tournament takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, you can inquire with the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Generally speaking, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, credit cards will likely not be usable, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, bears, and pretty much any large animal can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave port.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, which was organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the town that resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the seafront. It is safe to swim here.
The most common local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It is perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A "short black" is called "espresso," cappuccino has lots of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent in return.
Many people visit the reef year-round, and people rarely get injured on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to advice from the authorities, read and adhere to advice on signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the sea; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals on specific hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other forms of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, changes or requests should be directed to the tour operator first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of participants at music festivals choose to camp on-site, and many participants consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where the action is, you need to get there early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has finished, there may still be parts of the festival playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you're crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those who are closest to it.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions), which is good to know, as cruises to St. Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to ensure guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them in the establishment.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered on the house. But drunkenness impairs judgment, and all true gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is low friction, and you can't drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and slippery conditions are common in many countries, and traffic mostly flows smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are the highlight for many and are perhaps what draws the most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land journeys to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the vehicles, and therefore standard equipment is sufficient to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari" or "safari on foot") consists of hikes that last either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If you don't have the option of using an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorch marks).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit diseases.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are not usually regarded as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in specific locations that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers heading to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
Be alert if you're not used to driving on country roads: there are plenty of steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on stretches before and after—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and it's even more important than usual to adhere to them precisely.
Oddly enough, the cell phone coverage is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very flavorful and varied, just like in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common: apples are baked into cakes year-round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Moreover, many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand.
If you're in the mood for some small but rich pastries, you can try what, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is common to use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a wide variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, if the expression is used without further elaboration, it typically refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a range of simply spiced dishes, where the most popular spices are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose safety concerns due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, features a number of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain peaks present absolutely breathtaking views from the summits for all visitors. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among its endless potential for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sporting activities that involve descending snow-covered terrains with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski bums" - who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5,000 BC show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to, but does not usually involve alpine-style skiing or mountaineering. The latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You should view the ski route as if it were a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than if you walk – but it is very rarely that you will achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
In this context, however, the Schengen area functions more or less as a single country.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, with the age limit potentially being lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding it is also important for many Sami people with other professions.
However, traditionally not all Sami people herded reindeer on a large scale; some lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, and primarily used reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami people's territory.
Although the word "gypsy" is often used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel advisories are issued for the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
It may also be that you want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be tailored to their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The advisories are only a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often with a cursory glance at the matter, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage or serious social disruption, or cost human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur worldwide, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme precipitation, and wildfires are forms of, and effects of, severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, drifting snow, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their area, as it could impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely give you the address of a local business.
A course will typically cover all the topics discussed here in far more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but there aren't many publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they bring valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with unspecified gender (X), or documents that are updated to reflect a person's desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies just as much.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the period since September 11, 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not had surgery should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current formed by waves returning and breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar feature, is called a rip current.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it's no harder to swim back than normal.
Try aiming for a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been discovered, you might wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock comes on faster than culture shock (there isn't the same initial period of excitement about the new), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt back to their own culture.
When you come home again after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you travelled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, as they knew that a traveller in a completely new country needs to adapt.
People don't necessarily expect that patience and understanding are needed when returning home as a traveler.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Normally you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have the highest number of bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains meet on the high plain and form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range possesses Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without cell service, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
One option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school leavers, as it allows them to take a year out before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of getting a place at a higher education institution in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailors. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes as well as in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagoes and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, you get a different experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat reminiscent of Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a couple of full days, returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before, or if they have experienced a traumatizing event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different than the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Delivery companies charge a premium for fast delivery. Often, time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and in smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they sent goods via air freight, it could have taken days to get through unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airlines' rules don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger. That's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put down a large pile of money to get the opportunity (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this isn't cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy class price for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
Moldova's capital is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is not recognized by any member states of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the country's second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transportation hub.
What once was the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial city situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are surrounded by traditional red tile roofs, the old 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean-European than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some gravestones.
It's worth spending half an hour or so wandering around the fascinating village.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, made famous among foreigners after a glowing account of its splendor by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb Bus 403 regularly runs to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Further north, you can also visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (altar), which is the site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave. A place that has absolutely crucial significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site with markings or by carving graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it has been legally established as the official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also used a lot, in public transport and other facilities.
General announcements in the metro are only given in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are announced via an automated system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as politely as possible; you should act as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make it significantly easier to get around.
The Parisians' cool exterior quickly evaporates if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forest areas - mainly beech and conifers - and offers a mix of both alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types, and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Here, alongside many more common species, one can find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees, while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have scarves for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially some with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can be borrowed from the storage at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after every use, so you might not feel entirely comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and the use of a good amount of olive oil.
A simple, popular meal, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any kind of available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie" for "you" (formal), always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and adjectives.
That undoubtedly also makes reading easier, although writing is complicated somewhat by the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly straightforward grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that you don't need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated today and remain as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution wasn't such a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Viewing blossoming cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from plum trees were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, therefore you should resist the temptation to "just take one sample."
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect "samples."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when you find yourself in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less frequent).
There are also a few buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure to check if the bus you're considering taking goes into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme to base a vacation around.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as Jesus's birthday.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from around the world have adopted many of the holidays' traditions.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night to see the sunrise in an exposed location.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may very well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity.
The more traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil on Saturday night of Easter weekend, where congregations often break out in celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
As there aren't many people living in the areas, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important, and therefore emphasizes group effort over praise of individual achievements.
Workers often need to have their superiors approve all the decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
