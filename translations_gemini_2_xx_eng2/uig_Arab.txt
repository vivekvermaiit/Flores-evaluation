This at least confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widespread theory, although there were no details in the fossils about their color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists said that the upper part of this animal's feathers is chestnut brown or whitish, and the lower part is carrot-colored.

The trunks or spines of dinosaur feathers were not well developed, but they had branches or barbs. Researchers understand these barbs to be a later-developed characteristic.
The structure of these feathers indicates that they were used for temperature regulation or display, rather than for fighting. Researchers noted that although this was a young dinosaur's tail, the feathers in this specimen were mature and not juvenile feathers.

Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekuoya was subsequently charged at Edinburgh Sheriff Court with killing his son.
He is being held pending charges and trial, but the reliability of eyewitness testimony may be weakened because his picture has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice in other parts of Britain, but the Scottish judiciary considers the publication of images before sentencing to be incompatible with due process.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at Dundee University, said, "Reporters seem to be heading down a dangerous path by publishing the suspect's photo."
The Royal Household, which has overall responsibility for the indictment, has informed reporters that no further comment will be given until at least after the indictment.
According to disclosed information, this document concerns Palestine restoring its borders to those before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics include the status of Jerusalem, which is considered sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands to continue stationing troops in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to five years of stationing.
Guards closely monitor the sharpshooters in the pest control proficiency test because the test is observed and its effectiveness is evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Branch, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of NPWS, which is responsible for park and heritage protection, the four sharpshooters selected for the first culling operation received thorough safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in and formed a nine-member new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth time being CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures to lead the country to new elections.
This council was Martel's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
These resistance demonstrations, sometimes marked by violence, initially began in 2011 due to the failure to hold elections.
There were over 60 reports of iPod overheating incidents, six fire incidents, and four cases of minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI issued a statement announcing that Apple had reported another 34 overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry commented that Apple's delay of this report was "truly regrettable."
An earthquake occurred in Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (09:19 AM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management said the nation had not suffered any damage.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former police officer in the Philippines hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at tourists.
Several of those taken hostage were rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, similar to the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an old woman who had gone to the bathroom. Mendoza had been shot and killed.
Lyggins followed in his father's footsteps and worked in the field of medicine.
She studied obstetrics and gynecology and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, she used her free time to investigate the issue of premature birth.
His research shows that administering hormones can accelerate lung development in fetal infants.
According to Xinhua News Agency, government investigators found two "black box" aircraft recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the original super diva. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. A one of a kind night just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels responded, saying, "Luna was just as crazy as me... maybe even more so... I love her and miss her, and I hope she's in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that Australia should only become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of those surveyed share the view and hope that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
At its peak, 29 percent of those participating in the Raisina Dialogue thought that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
This athlete, who won a gold medal at the Olympics, intended to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three medley events, but complaints about his physical condition raised doubts.
He couldn't take painkillers because they were banned in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25th.
In early February, many people verified this discovery through hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source that delivered water to Earth, bringing with them organic materials that can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists have been trying to understand the formation of planets, especially the formation of Earth.
Kumo, 53, became the state head earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and stupidity."
He is expected to participate in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen, according to the FAA, is a system that helps airplanes fly shorter distances and reduces carbon emissions by saving millions of gallons of fuel each year.
Instead of using outdated ground-based radar technology, it helps air traffic controllers to more accurately pinpoint the location of airplanes via satellite technology, providing pilots with more precise information.
Other transport will not be suspended, subway trains will not be stopped at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be out of service.
Concerns about poor attendance have increased the likelihood that the team will be forced to hold the game behind closed doors if supporters don't show up.
A study published in the journal "Science" on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the gradual evolutionary process, which usually takes a long time, was established in just two generations for this new species, following mating between a local Geospiza fortis Darwin's finch and a Geospiza scandens immigrant cactus finch.
Gold can be formed into various shapes. It can also be made into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a fine wire that can be bent and straightened. It can also be flattened by hammering or rolling.
It can be made extremely thin and applied to other metals. Because it can be made so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This chemical is called pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Beet juice changes color depending on whether it is acidic or basic (alkaline).
pH is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in a chemical substance that has been tested for pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix two parts dry powder with clean, wet hands, then squeeze and roll into balls.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layer, creating an interesting sensation and forming a layer of skin.
Every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with running water connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of flushing toilet systems have been found in Minoan houses in the cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. Roman culture also had toilets in baths that were used by both men and women.
If you want to call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and immediately returns to Earth.
The satellite was sent into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere affects some light and observations.
A large rocket 100 feet tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world immensely. The biggest thing the wheel gave us is convenient and fast transportation.
He delivered trains, cars, and many other means of transportation to us.
Among them are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized game, ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
There are small cats that feed on many small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds in the wild (including free-roaming domestic cats).
The secret to their success is the profound understanding, a unique skill inherent in every cat, that saves them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat species, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three fully grown male lions, up to thirty females, and cubs.
Female lions typically form large families consisting of related individuals, such as sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like wolf or dog packs, and lion-like animals (but not other cat species) are very deadly for prey.
Tigers, considered well-conditioned athletes, climb, (though not very well) swim, jump far, and can pull with five times more strength than a human.
Tigers belong to the same group (Panthera genus) as lions, jaguars, and leopards. These four are the only cats that can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar with the full-throated sound of a lion; its sound is heard like a jumbled, disjointed series of words.
Eagles are fond of eating small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever they can. Almost all of the animals that eagles hunt for food are much smaller than themselves.
According to scientists, predators find their prey by smelling and following its scent.
They can see well at night and move very quietly. When a barn owl hunts, it stalks around and then pounces on its prey.
When a small group (a small contingent) of creatures becomes separated from the main population with which they live (if they cannot easily return, perhaps due to crossing a mountainous region or a river, or migrating to a new island), they face a new environment that is different from what they were accustomed to.
In this new environment, resources and competitors are different, so a new team needs different capabilities or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The original team remains unchanged; they still need to adapt as before.
As time passes, the new group begins to adapt to the new environment, and they gradually become different from the original group.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups become so different that they can no longer be said to belong to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which is the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of gradual evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses from plants, and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaurus was the most formidable hunter of its time, fearing nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long lower jaw was lined with over 70 sharp, blade-like teeth, and another row of teeth growing on the upper part of its mouth further suggested that anything that fell into its grasp could not escape.
We cannot say for sure, but it may have had a serrated tongue, and it likely fed on turtles, large fish, and other types of mosasaurs, and may have even been cannibalistic.
It attacks anything that enters the water, and even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus are no match for it.
Most of their food is familiar to us, but at Roman banquets there were also some strange or unusual things, including wild boar, dormice, thrushes, and rodents called "m√ºgdek chashkan."
Another difference is that poor people and women eat sitting on benches, while wealthy men are accustomed to reclining on platforms while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods brought to Europe from America or Asia in later times.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and they never tasted any ancient Roman wild chicken.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, and they considered it to be the god's home.
People brought sacrifices to God, and priests took care of God through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, towers known as ziggurats, which are special pyramid-shaped structures, were built as part of temples.
The tower's summit was made into a special palace for God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
Most of the lives of Jewish families were spent in openness.
The women cooked food in the courtyard; the shops were only opened in the streets. Stones were used in building the house.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland has a sparse population. Norse legends say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, traveled west, found Greenland, and named it Greenland.
Although he discovered this place, the Eskimos were already living here at that time.
Even though all countries are "Scandinavia," there are many differences in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland's people, kings, customs, and histories.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the "Declaration of Independence."
Actually, it's not like that. Something is written on the back of that document, but it's not a map.
Written on the back of the "Declaration of Independence" are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." This writing appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows exactly who wrote it, but in its early days, this large document (29¬æ inches long and 24¬Ω inches wide) was stored rolled up.
Therefore, these comments may be written in the form of tags.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was administered by the "Vichy" French. They were French people who, in 1940, did not fight against the German invaders, but became friendly with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion known as "Operation Dragoon."
Within just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and marched towards Germany.
Culture is the significant commonality of a large group of people who live together in a society and work together.
The word "culture" comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning citizenship. It is related to the Latin words "civis" (citizen) and "civitas" (city-state), and it also defines the scope of a society.
City-states are the leaders of the state. Culture refers to the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, leaving cultural imprints, and fair dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical facts and cannot be recognized as complete cultures.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states formed a weak central government, with the Congress of the Confederation as its sole body.
The national assembly had no power to levy taxes because it was not an executive or judicial body, it relied on state governments, but they were not very cooperative and imposed all their activities.
He did not even have the privilege of exercising power beyond its state tax laws and limitations.
Before amendments could be made to the constitution, all states had to unanimously agree; the states did not carefully consider the central government, and their representatives often did not participate.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Famous sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, tennis, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu Island), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because of its archipelago, Japan is often geographically referred to as the "archipelago nation."
Beginning in the 15th century, European sailors passing by Taiwan began to record the name of the island as "Ilha Formosa" or "Beautiful Island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a foothold in southern Taiwan, began to change the grain production methods of the indigenous people, and hired Chinese laborers to engage in rice and sugarcane cultivation.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army controlled the western and northern sea areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Dynasty.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which Japan controlled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana stone, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
In order to better help tourists understand the original appearance of the buildings, most of the buildings along the edges have been rebuilt.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the primary film standard as the analog film era was coming to an end.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, digital cameras inherited its aspect ratio for their image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit misleading, as it is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, this format's aspect ratio (derived by dividing and taking the simplest integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many formats (such as APS formats) usually match or approximate this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, a commonly misused and often ridiculed compositional technique, is a simple guideline that, while maintaining order in an image, can create dynamism.
He demonstrates that the most effective location for the subject is at the intersection of lines after dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
The wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was scrutinized during this period of European history.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has connected the various European countries, distinct from one another by language and customs.
From the king to the common people, everyone was affected by this absolute power.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to eliminate oppression and poverty, and churches regularly collect funds specifically for this purpose.
The central authorities of the church have been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and wealth has led many to question, "I wonder if this aligns with religious principles?"
Not long after hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Important military and civilian supplies were cut off, and although this siege violated generally accepted international law, which a number of international agreements over the past two centuries have established, the effectiveness of this strategy has been proven.
Britain laid naval mines in international waters, preventing any ships from entering any part of the ocean, which also brought danger to neutral ships.
Because the response to this tactic had been limited, Germany had hoped for a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the general attitude of most countries and citizens was pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and barbarity of warfare during World War I, nations were eager to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States and accepted a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his former work director) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different eras; each era or ruling family in China was its own distinct dynasty.
Even between various dynasties, there were unstable periods of provincial fragmentation. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these eras, many nobles fought each other, vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with millions losing their lives fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace of Chang'an.
Using a system of standards, transitioning from autocracy to republicanism and nationalism, and believing that the country belongs to the people rather than the ruler have many social and political impacts.
Furthermore, after the revolution, the profession was opened to all male applicants, allowing the most determined and successful to succeed.
The army is the same, because the army's hierarchy used to be based on rank, but now it's based on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad (peace be upon him) was deeply interested in things beyond his simple daily life. He would often visit a cave called "Hira" on the "Nur" (Light) mountain for contemplation.
Having been preserved since the cave ages, it vividly depicts Muhammad's (peace be upon him) spiritual yearning.
This cave was on the peak of a mountain north of Mecca, completely isolated from the world.
In reality, even if you knew its location, finding it would not be easy at all. It completely disappears once you enter the cave.
Besides the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains around, nothing else can be seen. Only a very small part of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the great pyramids built to commemorate the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Necropolis, also known as the Giza pyramid complex, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate the pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to commemorate Khufu's wives and family members.
The "√ústi Ya" (Upper Ya) symbol resembles a V, while the "Asti Ya" (Lower Ya) symbol resembles a staple or a chassis without a bottom.
"High" means you need to push it sideways starting from the top, and "low" means you need to start from the bottom (that is, where your hand is holding it sideways) and pull it sideways.
The upper jaw usually produces a softer sound, while the lower jaw produces a stronger and sharper sound.
You can mark the time with your sibling as you wish, but remember that the markings or beats have a musical reason, so they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, an anxious King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a group of female rioters from the market.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, sitting amidst a boisterous and threatening mob of revolutionaries who were shouting and gesturing wildly at the king and queen.
The rioters forced open the windows of the king and queen's carriage.
At one point, someone in the mob of rioters dangled the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The cost of the American imperialists' invasion of the Philippines was borne by the Filipinos.
They were forced to surrender the majority of the expenditures and interest incurred on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government, through Wall Street bank accounts, to the American colonial government in the form of taxes.
It is clear that the extraordinary profits gained through the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have become the primary benefit of American imperialism.
To understand the Circassian riders, it is necessary to understand the background that led to the formation of this organization.
The period in which these events occurred corresponds to the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD), which is known as the Middle Ages in European history.
The High Middle Ages refers to the period after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, with the Middle Ages generally considered to have ended around the 1500s.
The term "technological determinism" actually encompasses many views, such as technological transfer or technological inevitability, and in short, it suggests that human destiny is combined with scientific laws, driven by the manifestation of logic and technology.
In most interpretations of technological determinism, the following two ideas exist: technological development follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influences, and technology inevitably "impacts" societies that are natural rather than socially constructed.
For example, some might say that it promotes the development of motor vehicle roads.
Because the nationwide road network is economically inefficient for a small number of vehicles, new production methods have emerged to reduce the cost of vehicle purchase.
With the increase in car consumption, the rate of traffic accidents has risen sharply, which has promoted the development of technologies needed to treat patients injured in traffic accidents.
Romanticism has a strong element of cultural determinism, influenced by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In a romantic backdrop, the geographical environment shaped individuality. As time passed, customs and culture related to the geographical environment took shape. These are so integrated with the local society that they are far superior to arbitrarily created laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
In the twelfth century, its status declined mainly because the Crusaders brought back gifts such as expensive silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine market could provide.
The transfer of the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris happened precisely at this time.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the poor communication channels, the Western style may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time was the use of buttons to tighten clothing, which emerged from the Crusades to the East.
Self-sufficient farming refers to farming where farmers only produce food to meet the needs of their own families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, mostly organic system that maximizes yields by using seeds saved within its ecological region and employing crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, a large number of farmers engaged in self-sufficient agriculture, and this situation continues to be preserved in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who are disregarded by societal norms, giving them a sense of identity.
Subculture members vary in age, ethnicity, class, status, and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of various factors.
Members of subcultures often use unique, symbolic styles to express their identity. These elements include fashion, behavior, and speech, among other things.
One of the most frequently used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use examples of a small number of unfortunate children who, during their development, were neglected, abused, or deliberately mistreated, and whose social interaction was blocked by adults.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, parents abandon such children because they refuse to accept the children's severe mental or physical disabilities.
Street children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some say that some feral children were raised by animals; some say that some feral children lived alone in the wild.
The behavior of feral children raised entirely by animals (within their physiological limits), especially their fear or indifference towards humans, is essentially the same as the behavior of the animals that raised them.
Although program-based learning methods make the learning process easier and more interesting, the role of "penalty with a ruler" is still significant.
"Penalty shots" are not a learning method, but rather a supportive tool to assist people undergoing a new learning process, such as using a new computer program or starting a new application.
The "paperclip punishment" can be virtual or real. In other words, the teacher can be considered a "paperclip punishment," just like the paperclip in Microsoft Office.
The virtual "Taxtiper" software is adapted to allow students to ask questions, provide feedback, and seek explanations regarding programs that are typically difficult to handle on their own.
There are various reasons for taking children to orphanages, ranging from neglect to abuse and even fraud.
No child should grow up in an environment devoid of care, upbringing, and education, yet children are still growing up in such environments.
We consider the foster care system a safe haven for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare services.
Foster children should be provided with all the necessities they lacked in the families they were taken from.
The internet integrates public communication and private communication.
From the standpoint of applicability and satisfaction, the distinct characteristics of the internet lead to additional criteria.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been identified as important driving forces for internet usage (James et al., 1995).
When examining the responses of website visitors, Amy and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivating factors.
The application of video recording technology has led to important discoveries in explaining micro-expressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Reportedly, it is said that by accurately analyzing a person's micro-expressions, it can be known whether that person is lying or not.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out that even people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can accurately discern whether others are lying or not.
He even points out that animals like domesticated dogs have the ability to understand human actions.
20th-century research has proven that the gene variant pool is divided into two types: latent and overt.
Sudden mutation creates new gene variants, taking them out of the apparent gene pool through the selection process.
Division and reunification alternate between these two warehouses in every era.
For primates with digestive systems similar to humans, it is difficult to obtain the necessary amino acids from the grasses currently available in grasslands.
However, if it doesn't do this, it will face consequences such as growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant-based protein sources are leafy greens and legumes. However, these are difficult for primates, like humans, to digest without cooking.
In comparison, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easier to digest, but also provide protein with all the essential amino acids in large quantities.
In conclusion, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the grasslands using methods similar to those of present-day chimpanzees.
Sleep fragmentation refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and then falling back asleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This process can be easily achieved by gently waking them up with fairly light alarm clock sounds, without fully waking them up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm without waking up, you can try putting the alarm in another room. This way you'll be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biologically-based rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, which are known diuretics), activities that force a person to get up and urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the degree of physical and mental tension they experience.
The less tension, the more active the vitality. Every person has the potential to feel absolute peace and contentment.
Every human being can attain the truth. The only factor hindering this goal is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha. However, it further expanded under the influence of the Mahayana school's path of compassion and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, deep meditation, and complete self-love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the power to reach enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The central divine yoga of profound Tibetan contemplation. Through visualizing various deities, the power path is purified, chakras are revitalized, and a consciousness of attaining truth is created.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy of the United States and the Soviet Union, so these two countries cooperated with each other. With the end of the war, clashes in terms of system, order, and culture led to the separation of these two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies turned into enemies, and the Cold War began.
This war lasted for 40 years, and real battles took place between proxy armies in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places, stretching from Africa to Asia.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense line was breached, and the only hope left was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army violated the "Treaty of Riga," the "Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact," and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading eastern Poland and establishing the Belarusian and Ukrainian battle lines, all of these plans were washed away overnight.
Shipping by boat is still the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
In the tradition of naval service, your navy is responsible for hindering your enemies' ability to move people and goods while ensuring your nation's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples is the Battle of the North Atlantic in World War II. The Americans wanted to help Britain by transporting people and materials across the Atlantic.
At the same time, the German Navy mainly used U-boats to try to block this transportation.
If the Allies had been defeated, Germany could probably have subjugated England just like other countries in Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began raising them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Goat herds are usually raised in groups in mountainous or other pastoral areas, and the goat herders are usually young people or teenagers, resembling shepherds more closely. These methods of herding are still practiced today.
Wagonways were built quite early in England in the 16th century.
Although the wagonway was only made up of parallel timbers, it still allowed horses to pull wagons faster and with larger loads than on the rough roads of the time.
Sleepers were used quite early on to fix the rails in place. However, it was gradually discovered that the rails would be even more effective if iron were placed on top of them.
This became the standard, but the iron wagon caused the wooden wheels to wear out more quickly.
Eventually, the wooden wheel was replaced by the iron wheel. The first complete iron rail came into being in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, starting with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright walking").
Their ancestors did not walk upright like the Southern Ape-Men (Australopithecus).
Bipedalism experts discovered the fossil of the Australopithecus africanus from 3.9-4.2 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, join environmental activities, and even become activists to reduce future suffering to a certain extent.
This often resembles a symptom of illness. However, if we don't just seek temporary solutions, then we need to find the root of the problems and solve them.
Clearly, the development of human science and technology has brought about many changes in the world, and problems have further increased due to population growth and people's luxurious lifestyles.
On July 4th, after being approved by the parliament, the written draft signed by Parliament Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few streets away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, and it is now known as "Donlap copy".
John Nixon read this document for the first time in public on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy was delivered to London on August 10th.
It is the oldest known copy of the document, of which 25 fragmented copies are known to exist. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive; we call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many aspects that resemble dinosaurs.
They have foot pads and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
All computers currently in use are based on controlling information coded in the form of binary system numbers.
In a binary system, a digit can only be one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers, called bits in the computer binary system, are used as a professional term in the computer industry.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are very general and may not lead to an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be an open medicine bottle or poisonous household chemicals.
For practical emergency rescue instructions, check the specific poison's label.
The term "Kurut" is officially used by entomologists for insects in this group.
The term comes from ancient similarities in bedbugs, which are among the insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Fleas and lice both belong to the category of parasitic worms, and they live in nests or on the body they bite.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a major neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS (multiple sclerosis) as men.
A couple can decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child.
This couple can choose to make adoption plans for their child.
In adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated, and only then can another couple become the child's guardians.
The main goal of science is to understand the laws of the world through scientific methods. This method, in practice, guides most scientific research.
However, an experiment is not solitary; it is a kind of test that can eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations also guide research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's scientific views, including his psychology, were accepted.
When Greek knowledge was rejected, the West found itself cut off from the philosophical and scientific roots of Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are mostly internally generated cycles and depend on their generation through biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms are not merely simple responses to external cyclical cues but are also recorded in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can continue to cycle freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the fundamental proposals regarding DNA being the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, to transfer their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments labeling either the DNA in bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations in genes can lead to a variety of different changes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only changes in reproductive cells are passed on to offspring; changes elsewhere cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying landscapes with plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about ecological system information.
An example of this is visiting orangutans in the state of Borneo, taking pictures, and learning a few things about them.
Every morning, people get into cars from small towns and villages and go to their workplaces, and the destination of their work passes by the very people from whom they have just departed.
In this bustling traffic flow, everyone is connected to and supports a transportation system that, in some way, relies on private vehicles.
Current scientific research shows that this massive carbon economy has broken one of the stable states that supported the gradual development of humans over the past two million years from the biosphere.
Everyone lives in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
You rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses in developed countries.
Why does the transportation system generate such complaints? Why do they fail daily? Are traffic engineers just incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental problem?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers operate within reasonable and appropriate ranges; therefore, traffic flow possesses a certain reasonable uniformity and can be essentially expressed mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship was established between three basic characteristics: flow, density, and speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and implementation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their body.
This provides them with even more extensive small spaces to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings back today are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some considered it correct, but many people thought the opposite, believing that the solar system revolved around the Earth (even including the Sun and other stars).
It seems logical, since the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest river in the world and also the second longest. It carries 8 times more water than the world's second largest river.
The Amazon is also considered the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles.
20% of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6387 kilometers (3980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of small rivers.
Although building pyramids out of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the scale and architectural skill of the Giza pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has a population of approximately 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in legislation and formal communication.
Italian is also the language that most of those who work there usually use, and Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these can be found in nature in their natural state and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed that everything is made up of one of the four elements, or a combination of several of them. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This substance seemed to have four states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but it also suggested that they can be transformed into new substances and form the things we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table of elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small; trillions of atoms can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, Brother became a good friend to many people when he was created.
Regrettably, with the emergence of new writing styles, the position and usage of the apostrophe have further declined.
People now type information on computer screens and never go near a pencil sharpener.
People wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new is invented.
A fusion bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bring a nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill, splitting the nucleus again then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they are prone to decay whether or not they are bombarded.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The Moon's crust is 70 kilometers thick at its closest point to Earth and 100 kilometers thick at its farthest point from Earth.
It's thin under the lunar sea and thicker under the lunar highlands.
Because the crust was thin, there may have been more lunar maria at the point closest to the Earth, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory aims to find the things that attract or captivate people.
These theories suggest that people start drinking when certain needs or desires reach adulthood.
These theories are partly concerned with what in people makes them do the things they do, and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior emerge when managers begin leading former colleagues. One type is trying to continue being "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties in aspects such as making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary penalties, evaluating performance and effectiveness, assigning responsibilities, and investigating people's responsibilities.
Another type is when a person transforms into someone unrecognizable, meaning they feel compelled to change everything the group is doing and make it their own.
Regardless, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the army.
This kind of behavior usually creates conflict between leaders and other members.
Virtual teams adhere to the same excellence standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual troop members often serve as the direct point of contact for physical troops.
They often have even more autonomy than traditional squadron members, as their squadrons may meet across different time zones, which their local administrators may not understand.
The existence of the real "invisible college" (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual college.
"Invisible Legion" is a management group where each member reports. The Invisible Legion sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-wasting process of building a learning organization? One goal of implementing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
Creativity and wisdom arise when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, the process of an organization collaborating to overcome obstacles can lead to new innovation development to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, its management must create a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning environment.
Egil (2006) described the continuum approach as a method that helps organizations achieve even higher work efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides theoretical methods of cognitive research with physical evidence, thus narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and movement supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, including traumatic injuries, wounds, and tumors, can affect motor function and cause changes in some mental abilities.
The development of new technologies enables us to see and examine brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand how our brains work.
Although the science fiction conception of artificial intelligence is strong, AI forms a highly important branch of computer science, which deals with the simulation of movement, learning, and intellectual adaptation in specific machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intellectual activity.
For example, managing, planning, and organizing, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces, etc.
Such affairs have become a separate discipline focused on solving real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems, like those built into some home computers and video game software programs, are now frequently used in economics, medicine, construction, and military fields.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Quite often, teachers like to take students to places that bus trips don't go.
Technology provides a way to experience virtual field trips. Students can sit in the classroom and view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or enjoy fine art.
Sharing outdoor travel experiences in virtual reality is also a good way to reflect on the journey and exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is updated every year, but the old version is kept online and used as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Although students may initially approach blogging with perfunctory grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes this.
Because students are often the most critical readers, a blogger will begin to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Writing blogs "forces students to further understand the world around them." The need to satisfy readers' interests inspires students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool for promoting collaboration, and students can use them to expand their learning environment beyond traditional classroom settings.
The proper use of blogs "can transform students into people who are even more capable of analysis and critique; by actively responding to materials online, students can define their position within the writing of others, as well as express their perspective on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, home to a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, Muskoka and beyond, still-untouched natural beauty awaits.
All of this and much more have further rendered Ontario as irrelevant people being typified as Canadians.
Even in the large northern regions, the population is relatively small, and some are almost desert-like with very few people.
A surprising population comparison: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and is considered a unique land when it comes to its wildlife species.
Numerous small islands, either independent nations or belonging to France, are famous for their luxurious beaches.
Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and Islam is widely spread in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India.
This region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
For women: It is recommended that any woman, regardless of her marital status, say "I am married."
Is wearing a ring okay (not that it looks too expensive)?
Women should be aware that things that might be considered harassment due to cultural differences can often occur, such as following or grabbing the wrist.
Firmly reject men. Don't be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences or not, doing so is not right).
The current city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the city was called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids, who used it as a strategic port.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, giving it the name Casa Branca. The city was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt this city and named it Dar al-Baida. Spanish merchants established a trading base here, and then named the city Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least worthwhile places for shopping in Morocco.
Around the old city, it is very easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods. For example, tagine pots, ceramics, leather products, hookahs, and a range of trinkets, but all of these things are prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, close to Rwanda.
Goma was devastated by lava from the 2002 eruption of Mount Nyiragongo, which buried much of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
While Goma is generally safe, anyone visiting Goma from outside must be aware of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
This city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano in Africa, and you can also track mountain gorillas at the most affordable prices.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Because it was quite difficult to reach, Timbuktu became a symbol of the exotic and distant place.
Although today its fame attracts tourists and the city has an airport, Timbuktu is still a poor city.
Due to the threat of sandstorms from the desert, this city was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
This city is considered one of the important stops on the program "Africa's Great Civilizations," produced by Henry Louis Gates' Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).
Because the Arab style is somewhat more pronounced than the African style in this city, it forms a clear contrast with other cities in the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
This park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones. Different wild animals are protected in each zone.
It is one of the main scenic spots in South Africa, and it is considered a flagship park within the South African National Parks (SANParks).
This park, like all national parks in South Africa, charges a daily conservation fee and an entrance fee.
Buying a wild card also has benefits. With this card, you can enter some parks in South Africa or all of its national parks.
The name of Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, which has become a focal point attracting many tourists.
Hong Kong's skyline can be likened to a shimmering bar graph composed of rows of tall buildings, further illuminated by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to find the best place to see the Hong Kong skyline, leave Hong Kong Island and go to the Kowloon waterfront opposite it.
Major urban development in Hong Kong is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This place is where British colonialists considered their own territory. So if you are looking for evidence of Hong Kong's colonial history, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world. It is about 80 kilometers (50 miles) long and stretches from the coast into the interior of Bengal and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Indian part of the forest is known as Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests not only end with mangrove swamps, they also include the last remaining part of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The area of the Sundarbans is 3850 square kilometers, of which approximately one-third is wetland or swamp.
Starting in 1966, the Sundarbans became a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that the area is now home to 400 Bengal tiger families and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the bus station (across the river) during the day, but most buses, especially those going to the eastern region, Jakar or Bumtang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Because buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
In most areas, small Japanese coaster buses operate, which are comfortable and reliable.
Taking a shared taxi to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200) is both a quick and comfortable way to get there.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the Brazilian city of Oiapoque with the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The height of the two towers is 83 meters, the length is 378 meters, and the width is 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but traffic did not begin until March 2017.
The bridge was planned to be fully operational in September 2017, after the completion of the Brazilian customs inspection point.
The Guaran√≠ were the most important indigenous inhabitants living in eastern Paraguay today, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes, where tribes such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√° live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the Great Province of the Indians," emerged from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the local inhabitants.
The Spanish initiated a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has successfully preserved many of its local characteristics and identity.
Argentina has a reputation for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest competition of this year is scheduled to be held in December at the Las Canastas Polo Field.
At other times of the year, you can see smaller competitions and games on the grounds.
If you want to know where to buy tickets for this tournament and polo matches, please inquire with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to 1 Pound Sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC East shop.
The pound sterling is accepted everywhere in the Falkland Islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted in Stanley.
While British Pounds and US Dollars may be accepted, credit cards might not be accepted on the surrounding islands; contact the owner in advance to find out the accepted payment methods.
Exchanging Falkland Islands Pounds outside of these islands is virtually impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to exchange Falkland Islands Pounds before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; in summer, there are often days when the temperature exceeds 30¬∞C.
It's cold in winter: it's rare for temperatures to drop below freezing. But the combination of wind and humidity makes people feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy seasons" and "dry seasons": annual precipitation is generally consistent.
Although many animals in the zoo are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild, and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how gentle they may seem, wild cattle, moose, argali, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, more than a dozen tourists are injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they need to be given their space.
Besides that, you should know that strange smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a naval standoff with a notorious reputation occurred in this port when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave.
Except for one British ocean liner, all other ships sank, resulting in the deaths of nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in this market led to the assassination of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches because it is nestled between two harbors; the most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are safe swimming beaches with sandy shores, and many are shaded by p≈çhutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Marine Park is located on the WaitematƒÅ Harbour in the Bucklands Beach and St Heliers bays of central Auckland.
This place has family beaches that sometimes get crowded with people, and all sorts of shops located along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Birinchi Nomur" (First Number), which is not a blended beer, but a delicious and invigorating one. Another local beer is called "Menta".
There are many French wines to choose from, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better.
Drinking the local tap water is completely safe, but if you're afraid to drink it, finding mineral water is not difficult either.
For Australians, "white coffee" is an unfamiliar concept. A small black coffee is called an "espresso," a cappuccino is piled high with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and the fruit juice, although expensive, is very good.
This large wave-cut platform attracts many tourists throughout the year, and injuries caused by this large wave-cut platform are very rare.
Even so, seek advice from the supervisors, obey all instructions, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear in the coastal and estuarine waters north of the 1770 township from October to April.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries and bays north of Rockhampton.
Travelers feel more at ease when they book in advance because then they are sure to have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Although you can book other forms of accommodation like camping through a travel cooperative, most of the time travel cooperatives have agreements with established hotels.
Travel cooperatives typically offer package services that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even package deals that combine airline tickets and accommodation.
They can also hold the booking for you if you want to consider the offer or process other documents (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be handled through the travel agency first, not directly with the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on-site, with most participants considering it an important part of the experience to be had.
If you want to be closer to the action, you need to pitch your tent early, near the music.
Even though the main stage music is over, don't forget that there might be parts of the festival that continue playing music until late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the compartments, as the impact of cutting through the ice creates a terrifying noise for those in the compartments most affected.
St. Petersburg boat cruises also include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money of their guests; casinos have no windows, and it can be difficult to find clocks and exits.
They also have special dishes, drinks, and entertainment activities to welcome guests in a happy mood.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic drinks, but intoxication affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Those planning to travel at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, freezing, or icy weather conditions.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can't drive the car like you would on dry asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to bury you can fall in a very short amount of time.
Visibility can also be limited by snow accumulation, blizzards, and condensation or freezing on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, glacial and snowy weather is normal, and transportation is generally not interrupted throughout the year.
Safari may be the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and a highlight for many tourists.
The commonly used word "safari" refers to a land journey undertaken to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the wildlife in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, making standard equipment have good observation results.
Lions, tigers, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "foot safari," or "ramble") consists of walking and can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo is the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, having hosted it once in 1964.
If you booked 2020 flight tickets and accommodation before the postponement announcement, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not be extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled, through the end of March.
It is estimated that most event ticket prices will range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that you can borrow if they aren't in your room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer.
Be careful that the clothes don't get too hot (this will cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
Water can be purified through various methods, and some of these methods are more effective against certain threats.
In some regions, boiling water for an additional minute is sufficient, while in other regions, it needs to be boiled for a few more minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if you're not comfortable, you might consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar animals and pests.
Pests spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause hypersensitivity reactions, poisoning, or infection.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can powerfully injure or kill people are generally not considered pests.
If there are duty-free shops, in some places it's a good opportunity to buy duty-free goods.
Travelers to countries with high taxes sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The section of road between Point Marion and Fairmont is considered to have some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh High-Speed Expressway, often cutting through remote areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: there are steep hills, narrow roads, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limit is quite low compared to the preceding and following sections, typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to these limits is more important than anything else.
Interestingly, the mobile phone service here is stronger than in many other stretches of road, such as the barren wilderness of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are quite good. Bavarian pastries are quite diverse and varied, resembling those of neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruity pastries are very common, apple pastries are baked all year round, and cherry and apricot pastries are baked in the summer.
Many baked goods in Germany also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes usually go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you'd like to try small and sweet pastries, you can try these, which are known by different names depending on the region, namely Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on medicinal herbs and spices, often with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of curry sauce, it can be "dry" or "wet".
In northern India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used for curry; while in southern India and other coastal regions, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine is a general term for the diverse range of local dishes from the 17,000 islands across the country.
However, when no qualifier is added to this term, it mainly refers to dishes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely spread throughout the archipelago. Its characteristic is the set of simple ingredients used. The main flavor enhancers favored by Javanese people are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
A stirrup is something that hangs on both sides of a saddle and supports the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with more stability. However, stirrups also have safety issues, as the rider's foot can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and a foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may bolt and drag the rider. To minimize this danger, some safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots that have heels, are smooth-soled, and have a narrow leg.

Skiing is a primary travel activity for many enthusiasts. These enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as "ski bums," plan their entire vacation time around skiing in a specific location.
The concept of skiing is very ancient, with cave paintings dating back to 5000 BC depicting people skiing.
The history of skiing as a sport can be traced back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Snowshoeing: This activity is also known as snow hiking, snowshoeing, or snow walking.
He participates in activities such as backcountry skiing or mountaineering in the high mountains, but doesn't usually include backcountry skiing or mountaineering. These take place on steep terrain, requiring more rigid skis and ski boots.
A ski run can be compared to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover much greater distances than walking, but only in very rare circumstances can you achieve skiing speeds similar to those on a well-groomed trail without a heavy pack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Normally, traveling between multiple countries would mean having to go through multiple visa applications and passport checks.
However, the Schengen area is almost like a single country in this regard.
If you are within this area, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, so you can save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a vintage product. Some tax authorities define products older than 100 years as vintage.
This definition varies geographically, and the statute of limitations may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts, though newer than mass-produced products that resemble them, can still be considered antique works.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this occupation is also very important for many people engaged in other professions.
Although it is a tradition, not all Sami people participate in large-scale reindeer herding. Instead, they live by fishing, hunting, and similar methods. Reindeer are mainly used as pack animals for transportation.

For example, American citizens, Europeans, or Arabs in the Middle East may face different problems than they would elsewhere.
Note: This is just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere, the opinions presented are often crude, general, and overly simplified.
Severe weather is the general term for dangerous weather phenomena that cause significant social disruption or loss of life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and the types of weather vary. This may be due to geographical, topographical and climatic conditions.
Black blizzards, hail, excessive rainfall, wildfires, thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes are considered forms and impacts of severe weather.

Those planning to travel to countries considered war zones should receive professional training.
If you search online for "hostile environment training," you may be able to find the address of a local company.
A course here usually covers all the issues discussed and is typically conducted with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days. During the course, role-playing, numerous first aid exercises, and sometimes weapons training are conducted.
Books and magazines about living in the wilderness are common, but publications about war zones are very rare.
Tourists who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid documentation for their return trip.
Different governments have varying degrees of willingness to issue passports without gender information (X) or documents with altered chosen names and gender information.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies.
After September 11, 2001, the intrusiveness of security screenings at checkpoints also increased.
Before surgery, transgender people had no expectation of maintaining their privacy and dignity when going through scanners.
A rip current is a strong channel of water flowing seaward from near the shore, typically occurring in areas with rocks or similar features.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow mostly occurs in a few deeper areas, and from there, a fast current flows towards the deep.
Most fatalities occur due to swimming against the current and excessive exhaustion. Swimming against the current is not feasible.
Once you separate from the current, swimming becomes like normal and doesn't feel difficult.
Target another location where you won't be caught again, or you may have to wait for rescue depending on your technique and whether others have noticed you.
The conflict of returning to one's homeland happens earlier (the "honeymoon phase" is shorter) than cultural conflict, lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes find it not so easy to readjust when they return to their own culture.
After living abroad and then returning to your hometown, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your old habits from your hometown's culture.
When you first go abroad, other people may be patient and understanding because they know that newly arrived travelers need to adapt to the unfamiliar environment.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for tourists returning to their homeland.
The Sound and Light Show at Al-Ahram is one of the most interesting things for children.
You can see the pyramids silently in the dark before the exhibition starts.

The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
These scenes are shown on Al-Ekhram and different Al-Ekhrams are highlighted.
The sovereignty of the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, has been claimed by several countries and has the most stations, with 16 active stations in 2020.
These islands are located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest of them is King George Island, where the Las Esterlas station is located.
It includes Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the submerged caldera of an active volcano has formed an amazing natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the southern part of the Antarctic Peninsula and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula join together to form a high elevation, and then rejoin to form the 360-kilometer Ellsworth Mountains range, which was bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, is home to the Vinson Massif, the highest mountains in Antarctica, with Vinson Peak reaching an altitude of 4,892 meters.
In remote areas with no cell phone signal, satellite phones may be the only option.
Satellite phones cannot usually replace cell phones because you need to go outside to make calls on a satellite phone and avoid obstacles between the satellite and the phone.
This service is mostly used in maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as long-distance data and voice communication needs for expeditions, and the like.
Your local telephone service provider can give you more information about connecting to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular choice for those planning a gap year.
This school is favored by its graduates, and they apparently take a year off before going to university, which doesn't affect their studies.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year program abroad can genuinely improve your chances of transitioning to higher education when you return home.
There is usually a tuition fee for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating. In this "land of a thousand lakes," there are lakes and thousands more islands in the coastal archipelago.
You won't need a sailboat on these islands and lakes.
While the archipelagos along the coast and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, a small boat, or even a canoe, offers a different feeling.
Rowing is a popular Finnish pastime, with an average of one boat for every seven or eight people.
The situations in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are similar, but still somewhat unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is 1 in every 40 people).
Many unique Baltic Sea cruise ships have extended stops in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit this historical city for a few days while sleeping on the ship at night.
If you disembark on a shore excursion through a cruise, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships have a Berlin travel brochure from Germany, even though it's obvious that Berlin isn't near the sea, and the price of the cruise doesn't include a visit to the city.
Traveling by airplane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
This is not something to be ashamed of: there are many people who have personal fears and other things they dislike, and this is no different.
For some, having a little understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help them overcome the fear of the unknown or the fear of something they cannot control.
Express delivery companies charge well because they deliver items quickly. Time is usually very important for business documents, goods, or urgent repair parts.
In some sectors, large companies have their own airplanes, but for other sectors and small companies, this is a problem.
If they send things by air transport, it may take a few days for unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only way to expedite delivery is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send unaccompanied baggage, which is a loophole.
To get flight upgrades to first class or business class, you have to shell out a thick wad of cash (or, better yet, get your company to pay).
Even so, it certainly won't be cheap. Even if we calculate in the most basic way, the ticket price for an ordinary compartment will be 4 times the price of a medium-grade compartment and 11 times the price of a high-grade compartment.
Generally speaking, when flying directly from location A to location B, there's absolutely no point in looking for discounted fares offered to business class or special premium sections.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of air passengers who are willing to pay a premium and are charged accordingly for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and comfortably.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova, and the local language there is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.

Clearly, if you know Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easy.
However, someone who knows a little Spanish might conclude that because Portuguese is similar to Spanish, there is no need to learn Portuguese separately.
Old observatories are now obsolete and are used as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't as much of a problem during the heyday of these observatories as it is today, they were usually located in cities or school districts, making them easier to access than observatories built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote areas with good weather conditions.
The cherry blossom viewing, known as "Hanami" in Japanese, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originated in China, and the flower that has been welcomed here is the Chechen Aynula flower.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom viewing parties were organized by the Tenno himself and other nobles surrounding the imperial family.
Plants look their best in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to take away "just one" specimen.
If you collect "samples" while visiting a formally landscaped flower garden, you will undoubtedly be kicked out.
Generally, Singapore is a very safe place, it's very easy to get around, and you can buy everything after you arrive.
However, because it is located a few degrees north of the equator in the "high-heat zone," you must withstand high temperatures (consistently) and strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, although less frequent).
From here, there are also buses to Hebron in the north, where the traditional burial ground of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives, who are mentioned in the Bible, is located.

There is a tradition of staying up all night in an open place to watch the sunrise on Easter.
Of course, there are Christian theological interpretations that explain this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In many traditional churches, an Easter Vigil is held on the Saturday night of Easter, and people usually celebrate and commemorate the resurrection of Jesus at midnight.
The first animals to arrive on the island either swam, flew, or floated there.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not complete this journey, and as a result, giant tortoises became the dominant land animals in the Galapagos.
After humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals such as goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs were introduced.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, which means the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the aurora because the sky remains almost completely dark day and night.
