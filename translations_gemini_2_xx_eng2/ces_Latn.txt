One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially looked promising, but formal studies suggested it had less benefit in preventing death than had been hoped.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control treatment. In other words, scientists used it as a baseline for comparing three other treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic Family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the United States Olympic Committee's statement that the interests of our athletes, their clubs, and the sports themselves will be better protected if we support meaningful changes within our organization, rather than if the organization loses its official authority.

This finding not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory that is already widespread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-tinged underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the issue of feather development in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a very developed rachis, the central shaft, but do have other features - barbs and barbules - researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Scientists hypothesize that even though it's a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult plumage, not that of a juvenile.
Scientists presume that even though it is a young dinosaur's tail, the plumage represents that of a mature animal and not the down feathers of a hatchling.
A car bomb that exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than 20 other people.

They found that the Sun works on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is apparently determined by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
Based on luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of a star is determined, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less magnetically active the star is.

The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
He warns against the impossibility of guaranteeing that any targeted activity in present-day Iraq will stop sectarian fighting, escalating violence, or the slide towards chaos.
The report begins with a plea for open debate and the creation of consensus in the United States on policy toward the Middle East.
The report is largely critical of almost all aspects of the executive branch's current approach to Iraq and calls for an immediate change of course.
The first of his 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be undertaken before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was searching for a phenomenon that could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on the Earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of "halo" and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In the interview, he stated that the new variant is "highly concerning, even alarming, due to its high virulence."
Doctor Moll believes that some patients may have contracted this virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 infected at one particular moment in South Africa.

29-year-old Dr. Malar Balasubramanian was found in Blue Ash, Ohio, a suburb roughly 15 miles north of Cincinnati. He was lying next to a road in a t-shirt and underwear, apparently under the influence of strong drugs.
She led the officers to her black Oldsmobile Intrigue, which was located approximately 150 meters away.
There they found the body of fifty-three-year-old Saroji Balasubramanian covered in blood-soaked blankets.
The police said the body appeared to have been there for about a day.
The first cases of the disease appeared at the end of July this season.
This disease is transmitted by pigs and passed to humans through mosquitoes.
The outbreak prompted the Indian government to take measures such as deploying pig hunters in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying pesticides.
The government also promised several million doses of encephalitis vaccine to help prepare healthcare agencies for next year.
Vaccination plans intended for delivery to historically most vulnerable areas have been postponed this year due to lack of funding and low prioritization compared to other diseases.

Infrared photos reveal temperature differences between day and night, suggesting these are likely caves.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface and at night, on the contrary, warmer.
"Their thermal variations are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but that is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff.
In France, voting traditionally takes place without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper into an envelope, indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law contains a fairly strict codification of the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that they did not contain any envelopes before voting began and that no envelopes were added other than those cast by counted and eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives who then witness the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Deputy Police Commissioner D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman, and we have seized a mobile phone and a laptop belonging to the victim from the detainees."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house at the moment of the car crash, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but witness evidence may be compromised because her image has been widely publicized.
This is standard practice anywhere else in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently, and the courts viewed the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are clearly walking on thin ice if they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The prosecutor's office, which is in charge of the criminal prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further information will be provided at least until charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document will concern border disputes in which Palestine wants to maintain the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly included are the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the treaty, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters were under strict ranger supervision during the supplementary pest control study, as the study was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation with NPSW and NSW Inc (the Australian Sporting Shooters Association), qualified volunteers were hired under the auspices of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Heritage, the four shooters selected for the initial cull received comprehensive safety training and instruction.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission represented Martelly's response to massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, and some have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating defective iPods were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management has stated that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released soon, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced the older lady because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to focus on premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone accelerates fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators discovered two "black boxes" containing flight data records on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night when there were two moons in the sky. Unique, just like she was. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna was as crazy as me... maybe even more so... I loved her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's somewhere where she's better off."
A public opinion poll conducted with 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people who disagreed with Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey participants share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding extreme views within the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his eligibility was in doubt due to objections raised against him.
He couldn't take the medicine he needed to overcome the pain, as medications are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed since comets collided with it long ago.
53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed these rumors as "political babbling and recklessness."
There is speculation that he/she will attempt a presidential candidacy in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
Compared to technology based on ground-based radars, it uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more precise information.
There will be no special transport arrangements in place, the Overground train service will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking facilities or park-and-ride options available at the venue.
Fears of a lack of transportation options have increased the chances that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without team fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in as little as two generations, even though this process was thought to take much longer, due to interbreeding between endemic medium ground finches, Darwin's finches, and immigrant cactus and large ground finches.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into miniature pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be bent and braided. It can be hammered or pressed into sheets.
It can be processed to a considerable thinness and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was often used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That's called the pH value of a chemical. You can make your own indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then form a ball from them with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, resulting in a peculiar sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of wastewater drainage systems have been found in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In ancient Rome, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which were frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite for the call.
A satellite in space receives a call and then reflects its signal back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and the field of view.
A large rocket, measuring over 100 feet, is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle changed the world in an unprecedented way. The most significant thing it caused was a substantial facilitation and acceleration of transportation.
He brought us a train, a car, and other means of transport.
Below them are mid-sized felines whose diet consists of medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) whose main diet consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in a system of ecological niches, meaning that each cat has its own specific tasks that prevent it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same genus (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's full-throated roar, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, recognizing the paths they took across the ground by sniffing.
They see very well at night thanks to their night vision and can move very quietly. Ocelots hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or a river, or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or methods of adaptation to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in a few thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and take in carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it had no worries about anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set embedded in the upper palate, meaning that anything crossing its path stood no chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but they may have had forked tongues. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may have even been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water. Even a large dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their food wouldn't be foreign to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual banquet concoctions, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their food sitting on chairs, while wealthy men liked to hold feasts together and recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia until later centuries.
They didn't have things like corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered his home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and ceremonies.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
At the peak of the tower was a peculiar shrine dedicated to a god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all the countries were part of "Scandinavia," there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not true, though. Even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence Dated 4th July 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is clear that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ x 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after its creation.
Therefore, it is likely that the entry was simply added as an afterthought.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles brought about the liberation of northern France, but the south of the country was not yet liberated.
He was ruled by the French "Vichy." These were Frenchmen who, in 1940, made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a specific culture shared by a significant, large group of people who live and work in cooperation, i.e., they collectively form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning "civil," and is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and also "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and in a certain way, it defines the size of the society.
The precursors of nations were city-states. The culture of a civilization is characterized by the passing down of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces, and adequate dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, with Congress as its sole component, operating under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities to enforce laws, which often did not cooperate.
It also had no power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended. The states took the central government lightly, so much so that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and in 2006 Italy won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands, and the largest of them is Honshu, making Japan actually the 7th largest island in the world!
Given the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is sometimes referred to geographically as "an archipelago".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644–1912) forces took control of the southwestern and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. Japan ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main areas: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the most frequent film size at the peak of the analog film era.
They are still manufactured today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has been adopted by the sensor formats of digital cameras.
Although it's somewhat confusing, the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio in whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed "rule of thirds" is a simple guideline that creates dynamics in an image while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having acquired wealth and power, became the target of detailed scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist precisely for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1,000 years. This concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of clashes, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain patrolled international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since this tactic met with only a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations.
As witnesses to the horror and cruelty of the First World War, nations yearned to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor from his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a ruthless war took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to seize the throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political ramifications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the land belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
After the revolution, professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the army, as military ranks are now based on ability rather than class affiliation.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to try to start revolutions in their own lands.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on a mountain called "Noor" (light) and contemplated there.
The cave itself, having survived for a considerable time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
Due to its location on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find her at all, even if you knew she existed. Inside the cave, she is in complete isolation.
There is nothing to see but a wonderfully clear sky and a great number of surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created as a tribute to the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "bow up" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "bow down" symbol looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up-bow means you start at the tip and press down on the bow, down-bow means you start at the frog (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward movement typically produces a softer sound, while a downward movement is stronger and more piercing.
You can write your own markings on the sheet with a pencil, but keep in mind that the printed markings have their reason from a musical perspective, so they should usually be adhered to.
On October 6, 1789, a terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Elisabeth Philippine Marie Hélène of France, were forced by a mob of market women to return from Versailles to Paris.
They left back for Paris in a carriage, which was surrounded by a raging crowd shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of the criminal group waved the head of a royal guard in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States' colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses, while bond interest flowed in the name of the Philippine government through banking houses on Wall Street.
Extra profits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would, of course, represent the fundamental yield of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which most consider to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, so-called technology push or the technological imperative, or even the belief that human destiny is governed by an all-pervasive logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most accounts of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an "impact" on societies that is inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that when motor vehicles appear, it necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in traffic accidents, which drives the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism carried within it a significant element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geographically shaped individuals, and over time, customs and a culture arose related to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were considered superior to arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted roughly until 1100 AD.
Its importance decreased during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that participants in the Crusades brought valuables back to Europe, such as silk and spices, which had a higher value at home than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this period that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, dresses were significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of this era was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming carried out to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system using seeds native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes dress, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization draws from several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "feral" children. Some feral children were imprisoned for long periods (usually by their own parents), while in some cases they lived abandoned because their parents rejected them due to their severe mental or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma, after which they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, while some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When completely raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits almost identical behavior (within physical limitations) to that of the caring animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals undergoing the acquisition of a new practice, such as using a new computer program or launching a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual as well as real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
The software incorporates virtual constructs designed to analyze, motivate, and explain procedures that might be too challenging for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment lacking proper nutrition, care, and upbringing, yet such cases exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is intended to provide for all the needs that were not met in the household from which the children were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet add another dimension when it comes to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivational factors for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing interest" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience responses to web pages.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions – facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
Specifically, by correctly interpreting microexpressions, you can determine if someone is lying to you.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks suggested how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities of interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century showed that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle differences between the two sets in both directions within each generation.
It is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to satisfy their amino acid requirements from the plant sources available in the open savanna.
If they don't do so, moreover, it has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant-based sources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us as primates to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved the protein problem similarly to how chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking from normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, as this forces a person to get up and go to the toilet.
A person's level of inner peace corresponds to the inverse of the level of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more good life force brings. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment can be attained by anyone. The only things standing in the way of this goal are our own tensions and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded with the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are basically very simple. They are kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. Clashes of systems, processes, and culture led to the breakdown of cooperation between the countries with the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years and was truly fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope was a retreat and regrouping of forces along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost instantly thwarted when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after the troops invaded eastern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transport is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of a navy was to ensure the state's ability to transport people and goods, but also to prevent the enemy from transporting their own people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, then Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain, similarly to the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often guarded by goatherds, many of whom were children or adolescents, similarly to the more well-known shepherds of sheep. These methods of herding are still used today.
Horse-drawn railways were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Although plank roads mostly consisted of just parallel planks, they allowed draft horses to achieve greater speeds and carry heavier loads than on other roads of the time, which were somewhat rougher.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually discovered that rails are more effective if they have a strip of iron on their surface.
This has become a common occurrence, but iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, with humans starting to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, generally did not walk upright.
Bipeds appear in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can live more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become activists.
In many cases, it's the same as symptomatic treatment. However, if we're not just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problems and get rid of them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and problems have grown as a result of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Overnight, something between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are currently called "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. One of the copies reached London on August 10th.
The oldest known surviving copies of the document are the so-called Dunlap broadsides, a total of 25 copies from Dunlap's printing shop. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many features on birds that are reminiscent of dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits – or, in computer jargon, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to establish an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions in case of that particular poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This term is derived from the age-old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are cunning, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method is, in fact, the guiding principle of most scientific research.
However, it's not just about experimentation in itself. An experiment is a test used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but asking questions and making observations are also important for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often fundamentally depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not merely responses to external periodic stimuli have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue their free-running cycle even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether germline cells were affected.
Mutations in the germline are the only ones that can be passed on to children, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the relevant ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people in cars leave small towns, heading to work, and in the meantime, others pass them by, heading to work in the place they themselves have just left.
Everyone participates in and supports this dynamic shuttle transport, which relies on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its stable state, which supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely encounter a similar level of complaint about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something deeper going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, examining traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range; therefore, traffic usually has a reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly allowed them to avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider selection of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Nowadays, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That sounds reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It discharges more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in either size or technical precision of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of the Vatican is around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are of the Roman Catholic faith.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be mined relatively easily even with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that it changes into new substances forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are classified as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil, after its invention, became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and secondary uses.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they never come into contact with a pencil sharpener at all.
One can only marvel at what happens to a keyboard when something newer comes along.
A nuclear fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's like pulling a heavy cart uphill. Then, by splitting the atomic nucleus, some of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with slight or even no contact.
The Moon's surface is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and around 100 km thick on the far side.
It is weaker under the sea and stronger under the mountains.
The near side may have more lunar maria because the crust is thinner there, allowing lava to reach the surface more easily.
Content theories are focused on discovering what appeals to people or what they can relate to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt as their own during adolescence.
These theories explore what motivates certain people to want what they do, and what in their environment compels them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues – peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of them."
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person changes beyond recognition and feels they must change everything the team is doing and do it their way.
Ultimately, the manager is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This negotiation often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as contact points for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of the so-called "invisible team" (Larson - LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The "Invisible Team" is the management team to which every member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for individual members.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for implementing the concepts of a learning organization is innovation.
Creativity and resourcefulness can emerge if all available resources are used effectively across the functional components of the organization.
The result is that the process of collaborating as an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to new, innovative processes for serving customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, its leadership must create an innovative company culture, implement knowledge sharing, and foster organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that organizations use to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the study of cognition, thus narrowing and refining this area of research.
Scientists are supported in their research by the correlation between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes never before seen by anyone.
This gives us a lot of information and material for creating simulation models, which will help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation with science fiction, it constitutes a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include inspection, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are embedded in a number of home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are an essential part of every subject. The teacher would often like to take her students to places where travel by bus is out of the question.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtually sharing excursions is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a webpage each year about their trip to the state capital. They redesign the pages every year, but the old versions remain online and serve as an album.
Even blogs can improve students' writing. Although their blogging is often marked by careless spelling in the beginning, the influence of other readers usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger strives to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to keep abreast of the world around them." The need to stimulate the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and inspires students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "allows students to improve their analytical and critical skills; through active responses to online materials, students can define their positions within the context of other texts and formulate their perspective on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada offering a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lie Niagara Falls, while to the north the beauties of the Muskoka region and more are still waiting to be discovered.
All this and much more emphasizes that Ontario is considered by foreigners to be a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people are surprised by the following population statistic: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island, and in terms of wildlife, it can be considered a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are part of France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries. It thrived in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route (Cape Route) from Europe to India.
To the north, it is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers declare themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also good to wear a ring (just be careful that it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should keep in mind that due to cultural differences, they may sometimes encounter harassment, and it is not uncommon for a man to follow a woman while walking, grab her hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't excuse it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, abandoning it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Beida, and the Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be carefully considered in light of the current state of fighting that continues to occur in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers one of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking experiences in Africa.
For getting around Goma, you can use boda bodas (motorcycle taxis). A typical price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Timbuktu is a poor city today, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction. It also has its own airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS television program Wonders of the African World, hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, appearing more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River lies on its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, here too you have to pay an entrance fee and a conservation levy.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which many tourists consider to be the main travel destination.
The display of buildings that make up Hong Kong's cityscape is likened to a glittering bar graph reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
You'll get the best views of Hong Kong if you leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of the dense urban development on Hong Kong Island is located on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that British colonists appropriated, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest single block of tidal mangrove forest, stretching about 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coastlines of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stretches of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans area covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Given that intercity buses are often full, we recommend purchasing your ticket several days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long, and it has two 3.5-meter wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani tribe was the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area we know today as eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has allowed Paraguay to maintain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
If you are interested in tournaments and where to get tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are widely accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, but you might have luck with British and American currency. Be sure to ask the owners in advance what payment method you can use.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange it before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer is here when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; temperatures above 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively freezing: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but coupled with wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons here: The amount of precipitation remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to people, they are still wild animals in the wilderness, and therefore should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Although they look peaceful, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured due to not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that bears and other animals in the wild are attracted to smells, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep your campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave port.
All ships except for one British cruiser were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans perished.
During independence efforts organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here, given that Auckland lies between two harbors. The most popular beaches are found in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located by the Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
Sometimes they are crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," which isn't a particularly complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines you could have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better choice.
Tap water is safe to drink here, however, if you are worried, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A small black is an "espresso," a cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but top-notch.
Throughout the year, many trips are taken to the cliff, and injuries resulting from any of these causes are rare.
Even so, heed the advice of authorities, follow signage, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of Seventeen Seventy. Occasionally they can be found outside of this time.
Sharks really do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
The saltwater crocodile does not actively live in the ocean; its primary refuge is the river mouth north of the city of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives travelers the certainty that they will have a place to sleep at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it's also possible to book other forms of accommodation like campsites through them.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel deals.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think it over or obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any modifications or requests should be directed to the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of visitors choose to camp on site, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the thick of things, you'll need to arrive as soon as possible to secure a camping spot that's close to the music production.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage has finished, music may continue in other sections of the festival until late at night.
Some festivals include special campsites for families with young children.
If you're traveling across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as sailing through ice causes unbearable noise in exposed areas.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are not subject to visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually try to ensure that guests spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible. They usually lack windows and clocks, and it is often difficult to find the exit.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep visitors in a good mood and on the casino premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, intoxication negatively affects judgment, so all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high altitude or through a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, so you can't drive the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to make driving impossible.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by dew or ice on the vehicle's windows.
However, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and operations continue throughout the year without major disruptions.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and represents the highlight of the entire trip for many tourists.
The term safari, in its common understanding, refers to a land journey undertaken for the purpose of observing the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and the standard equipment will thus allow a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can observe them better with binoculars.
A tourist safari consists of a walking tour lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it previously hosted in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, this situation may be difficult for you.
Cancellation policies may vary, but even at the end of March, most coronavirus-based event cancellation policies did not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with standard tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if they aren't directly in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters have varying degrees of effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to them in their home regions.
Nuisance insects can cause food spoilage, skin irritation, or in worse cases, allergic reactions, venom dispersal, or the transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force are generally not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping offers the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and other fees in designated areas.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxation can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially when purchasing products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, as it often runs through isolated, wooded terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep angles, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The speed limit here is significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections – usually 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and strict adherence to it is even more important.
Interestingly, mobile phone service works far better here than in many sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German desserts are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and diverse, very similar to those of their southern neighbors in Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apples are used in pastries throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular desserts are often especially suited to a cup of strong coffee.
If you'd like to try some hearty sweets, try pastries that, depending on the region, are called Berliners, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from various herbs, spices, and meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on how much liquid it contains.
In Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry. In southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, when used without further specification, this term usually refers to cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, features many simply seasoned dishes where peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices are the dominant flavors.
Stirrups, which hang on either side of the saddle, serve as support for the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can be associated with safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts to run, the rider can be dragged along. A number of safety measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a thin sole that is relatively narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall off the saddle when a falling rider pulls on it.
The Cochamo Valley – a favorite climbing destination of the Chilean Prime Minister, known as the Yosemite of South America, where you can find extensive granite walls and cliffs.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes thanks to the endless potential of the local rock faces.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a common travel activity with many fans, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century. The first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski touring.
It has a connection to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they are not part of the activity, the latter of which is performed on steep terrain and requires far sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In favorable conditions, you can cover slightly greater distances than on foot – but you'll rarely move at the speed you would achieve on cross-country skis without a heavy backpack and on a groomed track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with a number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control several times.
Nevertheless, the Schengen Area functions similarly to a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations, where, for example, the age limit in North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade items can be classified as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami people, and the culture associated with the trade is also important for many other professions.
Not all Sámi people, however, traditionally engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; they also made a living from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer only as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern crafts. Tourism represents an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although the term "cikán" is widely used, especially among the non-Roma population, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are about to visit becomes the subject of a travel advisory, this may affect your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance.
You might prefer to look at the advice of other governments rather than your own, but that is primarily intended for their own citizens.
For example, US citizens may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The consultancies are only a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and takes various forms that may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and fires are forms and consequences of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloudbursts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme meteorological phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all possible adverse weather risks in their area, as this may affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Training" will likely find the address of a local company.
The course typically covers all the problems described here in much more detail, usually also in the form of practical exercises.
The course typically lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing-based training, thorough first-aid instruction, and sometimes weapons handling.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications about war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid return travel documents.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a sex marker (X) or documents updated to reflect a person's desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies.
Security screenings at checkpoints became far more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people pre-surgery should not expect to pass through scanners and have their privacy and dignity remain intact.
Rip currents are returning waves that break on the beach, often near a reef or similar feature.
Due to the underwater topography, the return current concentrates in a few deeper sections, and it is precisely here that a rapid current into the deep water can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere where the current won't pull you back again, or, depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, wait for help instead.
Reverse culture shock sets in sooner than culture shock (there is a smaller initial honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture often have a particularly difficult experience readjusting to their native culture.
Having returned home from a stay abroad, you are accustomed to a new culture and have already lost some habits from your home country.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adapt in a new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed by travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things to do in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show even begins.
Usually, you constantly hear tourists and vendors here. The story of sounds and lights is reminiscent of a fairytale book.
The Sphinx functions as both a backdrop and a narrator of a long story.
Various scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the individual pyramids are illuminated sequentially.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by multiple countries and have the most research stations – in 2020, 16 of them were active there.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the mainland. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merge into a plateau and then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The Vinson Massif, the highest mountain range in Antarctica with its 4,892-meter-high Mount Vinson, is located in the northern part or the Sentinel Range.
In remote locations with no mobile signal, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because to make calls, you need to be outdoors without any obstructions between you and the satellite.
This service is frequently used by maritime transport, including recreational vessels and expeditions that require remote data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It's especially popular with people who are finishing school. It allows them to take a gap year before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad after graduating from high school can improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees are typically charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also includes thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
It's not absolutely necessary to have a yacht on archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland – there is one boat for every seven to eight people.
It's similar in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it's quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Baltic Sea cruises usually include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia, in their itinerary.
This means you can visit this historic city for several full days and return to the ship at night to sleep on it.
If you only disembark as part of a cruise excursion, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some tours in the brochure include Berlin, Germany. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the tour price.
Traveling by plane can be scary for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it's their first flight, or if they've had a traumatic experience.
This is nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that very many people have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome their fear of the unknown or the feeling that the situation is out of their control.
Shipping companies are well-paid for the fast delivery of goods. Time is often a very important factor for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but a problem has arisen for other routes and smaller companies.
If they were to ship the goods by air freight, it could take several days for them to clear unloading and customs on some routes.
The only way to get it done faster is to send the item as checked baggage. However, aviation regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most common way to fly in first or business class is to pull out a fat stack of cash (even better is to have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: you can expect to pay up to four times the price of a regular economy ticket for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, it's pointless to even look for discounts on flights from point A to point B in first or business class.
Airlines are well aware that there is a key group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and their prices reflect that.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been plagued by various ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led in 1994 to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of around 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest Turkish city, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a significant transportation hub.
Once a city of antiquity, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centers are interwoven with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one can see interesting marble sculptures of doves above some of the tombs.
A half-hour walk through this interesting village is worth it.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and captivating town of Sintra, which has become famous among foreigners thanks to its beauty, as described by Lord Byron.
Scotturb network bus number 403 goes to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-renowned site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass burial ground and also a place of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
Many men and women still live who survived internment in this place, and many more whose loved ones were murdered here or died of exhaustion from forced labor, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please conduct yourselves with all the dignity, gravity, and respect that this place deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site with markings or by scratching graffiti into the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the population prefers Catalan, a significant majority understands it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs and inscriptions are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the primary official language.
However, Spanish is commonly used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned service disruptions are announced by an automated system in many different languages – Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, rude, and arrogant.
Although often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is to behave as well as possible, that is, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will significantly facilitate all your interactions.
The initial impression that Parisians are somewhat brusque quickly fades if you show at least basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, or fir, and offers a mixture of alpine vegetation with Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diverse microclimates, varied soils, and different altitudes, significantly different plant communities grow there.
The area is also home to a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Besides many more common species, rare fauna can be discovered here, such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own shawl, especially a colorful one, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the supplies at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after every use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. They only have one size for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like the cuisine of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and often uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is called Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available ingredients, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word "Sie" (you - formal), are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It also likely makes reading easier, even though writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
In Italian, the pronunciation is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are C and G, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, pay attention to the different pronunciation of the sounds r and rr: "caro" means "dear," while "carro" means "cart."
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, if you read these grammar basics, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand individual phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know any of the Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, people who know a little Spanish may jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Observatories from the pre-modern era are now mostly outdated and serve as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution at their peak wasn't as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous devices in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were a popular flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, you will be unceremoniously thrown out for collecting "specimens."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe country to stay in. It is also very easy to get around there, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But given that it's located in the "true tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to contend with heat (always) and intense sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
Some buses also travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take is going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an interesting place to go on vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire and Rhine valleys, a tour of interesting cities along the Danube, or a cruise on the Erie Canal.
They also determine the routes of popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition where people stay awake during Easter night in an exposed location to see the sunrise.
Understandably, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as easily be pre-Christian spring and fertility festivals.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigils on Saturday night during Easter weekend, where the congregation often erupts in celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands swam, flew, or were carried there by wind or ocean currents.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to bridge it, and the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, a number of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a great opportunity to observe the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less the entire time.
Because these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is usually not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the view of the stars as well.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
The standard attire for a businessman is a suit, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Workplace harmony is key, and group effort is emphasized over praising individual achievements.
Employees must obtain approval from their superiors regarding every decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
