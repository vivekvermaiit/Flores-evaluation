This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already circulating, but it provides details that bones alone cannot offer, such as color, shape, and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say this animal was chestnut brown on top and had a yellowish or carotenoid-like colour underneath.
The findings provide insight into the evolution of bird wings.
Because dinosaur feathers possess a central shaft structure, called a rachis, but also have other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers theorize that the rachis developed before other feather structures.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight but instead for thermoregulation or display. Researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, not downy chick feathers.
Researchers suggest that, although this is a small dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult feathers and not downy juvenile plumage.

Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
That's right, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of murdering her son.
He has been arrested, and is supposed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, but witness evidence may have been tainted by the wide circulation of his image.
This is standard practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scots law operates differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee writes that "journalists are at risk if they publish photos and other materials of suspects."
The Crown Office, which deals with prosecutions, told the reporter that no further comment would be made at least until the trial takes place.
The document, it is said, will refer to border disputes, which the Palestinians demand in reference to the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Some of the topics discussed include the future status of holy Jerusalem for both nations and the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to such a presence for only five years.
The sprayers in the expanded pest control program would be closely monitored by the custodians, as the program was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, suitable volunteers are taken on, under the Sporting Shooter Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the first four shooters selected for the cull received full safety briefings and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth year as part of the CEP in four years.
In the past month, the presidential commission, prior to the lapse of the electoral act, recommended a set of measures to bring the country closer to voting.
The organization was Martelly's response to the change protests that were intensifying and had started in April.
One violent protest was caused by the failure to hold an election that was supposed to be held in 2011.
Sixty cases of iPod malfunction have been reported, causing six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said they were aware of 27 cases of equipment-related danger.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 overheating incidents, an event that the company says is "insignificant."
After Apple withdrew the report, the department breathed a sigh of relief, saying "this has been a disaster."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Cape disaster management office said no damage had been reported in the province.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there is no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino ex-police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by attacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle at tourists.
A number of hostages have already been rescued, and at least six have died so far.
Being detained by thugs six times, including children and adults, they were released in time, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of the elderly woman as she wanted privacy. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began working as a doctor.
She trained to work as an obstetrician and gynecologist and began working at Auckland’s National Women’s Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research indicated that the use of hormones would help accelerate lung development in the unborn fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found the two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Some wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the original Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on a double-moon night. She was beautiful just as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as me... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic have increased by eight percentage points since 2008.
The then Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of voters share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the extreme case scenario, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic immediately, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle as well as three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was in doubt.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain as it is banned in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people have confirmed this finding using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Ice and vapor in space may have been the source of bringing water to Earth, aided by natural methane capable of making proteins to support life.
Science tries to understand how the planets were created, especially how the Earth was created, because the lines connect with the Earth from a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed the same-sex marriage bill last month.
He refers to patronage as "political bribery and corruption."
He is estimated to have run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a program that the FAA says could allow airplanes to fly shorter distances, save millions of liters of fuel per year, and reduce emissions.
It uses innovative solar technology, unlike the old one that relied heavily on ground-radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to accurately pinpoint aircraft and provide pilots with precise feedback.
No additional transport is being laid on and underground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park and ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears about the lack of transportation for people have led to concerns that the game might not have enough supporters for the team.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science describes the existence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorean Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species emerged in just two generations, even though it was believed that this takes longer, due to interbreeding between the Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch.
Gold can be formed into any shape. It can be formed into many small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and is visible. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made extremely thin, and it adheres to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using the juice of red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether a chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry ingredients together, then with clean hands, squeeze it into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will be drawn out by the outer skin layer, which will feel rough and eventually form a crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of sophisticated sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman times, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together and mixed.
When you call someone thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in the sky receives a call and reflects it back immediately, it's that fast.
A satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with our light and reflection.
It takes a rocket over 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easy and fast transportation.
It brought trains, cars, and other means of transport.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and elands.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral cats) that eat most of the insect prey, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is doing specialized jobs, where each ant has its own task to perform so they don't compete with each other.
Lions are the only cats that live together in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions is made up of one to three related adult males, along with females and their cubs, which can number up to thirty.
Women tend to reproduce together, forming large families of sisters and their daughters.
Lion families are similar to wild dog or domestic dog families, animals that resemble lions closely (but not other wild cats) in structure, and are very dangerous to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, a leopard can climb (although not well), jump high, cover long distances, and pull five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The growl of a large leopard is not the same as the full-throated roar of a lion, but it is closer to a snarly, raspy vocalization.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals (their prey) to eat by smelling, sniffing where they have walked on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and they move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a splinter group) is separated from the larger population from which it came (such as being carried over a mountain or a river, or going to a new island so that they cannot easily return), it tends to find itself in an environment that is different from the one it was in before.
This new place has different resources and different competition, so new residents will need new things or adaptation in order to compete strongly, beyond the needs we initially had.
The original inhabitants have not changed at all, they still need the same transformation as before.
Over time, as young people begin to adapt to a new society, they slowly start to become more like other people.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two groups of people will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important aspect of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants are able to make food from the sun using a process called photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and make our belongings with plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus reptiles were the top predators of their time, so they feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long teeth were sharper than 70 razors, as well as an extra set in the palate of its mouth, meaning nothing could survive in its path.
We are not sure, but it may have been bilingual. It ate large fish, some ichthyosaurs, and may have eaten meat.
It attacked anything that entered the water; not even a large dinosaur like a T. Rex would be able to withstand it.
Although much of their food might seem strange to us, the Romans had a penchant for extravagant dishes with things like wild boar, peacock, dormice, and a certain type of mouse called a dormouse.
One difference is that while poor people and women ate their food sitting on stools, rich men preferred to have meals together where they would sit on the sides while eating their food.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included food from Europe, America, or Asia in ancient centuries.
For example, they didn't have maize, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The people of Babylon built a temple for their god that was known as the god's home.
People would bring offerings to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods by holding festivals and celebrations.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests may enter.
Sometimes distinct structures, called ziggurats, were built as part of churches.
The top of your tower was a place of idols.
In the hot weather of the Middle East, housing was unimportant.
Much of life in Hebrew families happened in the open air.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops have counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
And since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was very expensive.
Greenland was settled gradually. In the Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and when he sailed west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even though he had discovered this, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kingdoms, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Below the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". This text is at the bottom of that document, written upside down.
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that from early in its life, the large vellum document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was folded for storage.
Now, it is possible that the mark was applied as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was condemned by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and then collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded the south of France, in a campaign called “Operation Dragoon.”
In just two weeks, American and French soldiers had liberated southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
Culture is a system of shared meanings held by a group of people who generally live and cooperate together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means of Latin origin, related to the Latin "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and somehow describes the extent of society.
Cities are the centers of nations. The culture of civilization defines the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the enduring cultural heritage, and its appropriate dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving sufficient historical evidence and struggle to be seen as modern culture.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states began to form a weak central government – with only the Congress as the basis – under the Articles of Confederation.
The legislative body had no power to levy taxes, and for the reason that there were no national administrators or judges, it was dependent on the power of the state governments, which at times were unwilling, to enforce its laws.
It did not have the authority to override tax and pricing regulations between countries.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states disregarded the central government to the extent that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and they were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), netball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are popular in northern countries, with Italians competing in World Championships and the Olympics.
Japan has close to 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the country with the most islands in the world.
Because of the island clusters that Japan has, Japan is often referred to in geography as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history began a long time ago in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a revolution in the production of grain crops and employing Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In the year 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the coastal areas in the west and north, and Taiwan became a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after their victory in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which they ceded the administrative authority of Taiwan to Japan, who governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three important structures, called the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings next to the complex were built with the intention of giving tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common image format for land photography is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but importantly, its ratio was adopted by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm type, you know, like the usual, is 36 mm wide by 24 mm in height.
The format of this ratio (dividing by 12 to get the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or approximate this ratio.
The often misused and criticized rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining balance in an image.
The most effective area in this composition is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Roman Catholic Church, which possessed wealth and power, was viewed with suspicion.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith united the countries of Europe, despite their differences in languages and customs.
It is a divisive force that affects everything from the kingdom to the grassroots.
One of the key tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds exist specifically for that reason.
The head of the church law was in Rome for over a thousand years and the pressure of money and power made many suspect that his constitution was correct.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to blockade the German coast using the Royal Navy.
The plan appeared to be working, cutting off crucial support for soldiers and residents, even though this blockade violates previously agreed-upon laws in international agreements from two centuries ago.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering its sea areas, damaging even innocent vessels.
Because there was no significant response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of citizens and nations was a desire for peace and self-determination.
After witnessing the horrors and devastation caused by the war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to America to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 patents in his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different eras; each Chinese dynasty or ruling family represented a distinct epoch.
Furthermore, within each kingdom, there were unstable years of different provinces. The most well-known of these times was the Three Kingdoms epoch which occurred 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During that time a bitter war was raging among the royals for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was the deadliest in ancient Chinese history, with many people dying for the chance to sit on the highest throne in the high palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political consequences such as the implementation of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to its people and not just the ruler.
And after the Revolution job is open to all applicants to allow the most gifted and successful to succeed.
The same is going to the army because instead of the armies being based in the class, they are now based in the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people working in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond everyday life. He would often go to a cave known as "Hira'" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) to contemplate.
He overcame, survived those times, and gives a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Resting atop the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is a fascination for the whole world.
Furthermore, it's not easy at all to determine whether a person even knew it existed. Once you enter inside the cave, you are alone.
There is nothing that can be seen except for the clear, beautiful clouds above and the many mountains surrounding. Little of the world can be seen or heard from inside the silo.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century, the Great Pyramid is one of the grandest structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian district of the dead, has many pyramids (where the largest pyramid is also the widest), many tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like a V, and the "down bow" symbol looks like a u facing downwards, or a square that is not complete on the bottom side.
Uptown means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and downtown means you have to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A high-pitched whistle usually makes a low sound, while a low-pitched whistle is strong and powerful.
Feel free to mark your notes in pencil, but remember that the printed articulation marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of angry women.
At the carriage, they went back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of the plane.
At some point a mob member brandished the head of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The costs of the anti-imperialist war in the U.S. when considering the Philippines were paid for by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial authorities to meet the huge expenditure and bond revenue on behalf of the Philippine government to Wall Street housing banks.
Indeed, the immense profits obtained through the exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the income of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the Order's formation.
The period during which these events took place is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally ending around 1500.
The establishment of technology is an all-encompassing term in everyday life, ranging from the advancement of technology or the importance of technology to the rigid conclusion that the future of humanity is the laws of science and its manifestations in technology.
Most accounts of technological determination share two basic ideas: that technological development follows a largely autonomous path independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology itself has “impacts” on societies, rather than being shaped by them.
For example, one might say that vehicles lead to the development of roads.
However, road connectivity does not guarantee income due to vehicle ownership costs, therefore new development approaches must be implemented to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
Having many vehicles leads to an increase in the chances of road accidents, which leads to new strategies being developed for healthcare and treating independent bodies.
Romanticism greatly influenced the interpretation of culture, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the case of Romanism, geography shaped the people, and over time customs and a culture associated with that geography emerged, and these, in accordance with the community's location, were better than the established laws.
In this way, Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, while Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of old Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of sophistication began around 400 A.D. and continued until about 1100 A.D.
Its standard declined during the 12th century, largely because travelers brought back gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was precisely at that time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style emerged during the Middle Ages, between the 10th/11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. The greatest development of that time was due to the Crusades; people began to use buttons for fastening clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done with the purpose of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his household.
Subsistence farming is simple, often using fertilizers and conserved seed systems found in the area, combined with crop rotation or any method that increases yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in agriculture for subsistence purposes, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Minor cultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by societal norms and allow them to foster a sense of identity.
Minor traditions may vary due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
Characteristics that define a distinct culture, such as language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, locality, or a combination of these things.
Members of a culture often express their belonging through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashion, behavior, and art.
One of the common ways used to demonstrate the importance of human connection is to take a few examples of unfortunate situations where children have been neglected, suffered disaster, or been deliberately mistreated, and not connected with other people by adults while growing up.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some naturally wild children are confined by people (usually their parents); In other cases, the abandonment of the child was due to parental rejection of severe mental or physical disabilities.
Children who are badly affected are likely to have been severely abused before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some are accused of being raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised by non-human animals, a child exhibits behaviors (restricted by the body) that are very similar to the animal that cared for them, such as their fears and their inability to distinguish between people.
While project-based learning should make education easier and more interesting, the scaffolding framework takes a step forward.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a supportive approach that provides assistance to individuals learning new skills, such as using a computer program or starting a new job.
Scaffolds can appear real and authentic, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold but so is the paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
Visible scaffolds are embedded within the software and are designed to query, prompt, and explain concepts that might be challenging for a learner to handle alone.
Children are placed in child protection care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even abandonment.
No child should grow up in an environment that is underdeveloped, uncaring, and uneducated, but it happens.
We see the Early Childhood Development programme as a safe space for children.
Our child care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Child care should provide all the things that were lacking in the home from which the children were previously taken.
The Internet connects these two things with communication between people.
Clear internet governance frameworks lead to different levels of internet use, adoption, and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "communicating with others" are cited as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Engagement" and "ongoing relationship" were identified as key motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video and recording has allowed for significant discoveries in understanding subtle aspects of facial changes, facial movements that last only milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that a person can tell if another person is lying by being able to properly interpret the expressions on their face.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President’s Speech, demonstrated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to arrive at the truth accurately.
He even suggests that the ability to interpret human gestures may also exist in animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pockets of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation adds genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of displayed variations.
Segregation and integration shake different species back and forth among groups that share the same age.
In a predominantly staple-crop area, it is extremely difficult for a person to meet their amino-acid requirements using the available plants.
Moreover, doing so has negative consequences: increased stress, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest beneficial substances for plants to obtain are proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for the plants' digestive systems to process unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal-based foods (meat, milk, eggs) are easily digestible and have high-quality proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Given all that has been observed, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to chimpanzees in the wild today.
Sleep fragmentation is a way to wake up during your normal sleep period and fall back asleep quickly within (10-60) minutes.
This can be easily done by using a silent alarm watch to bring you to your senses without fully waking you up.
If you find that you routinely snooze the alarm when it wakes you up, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of water (especially water or tea, known as water loading) before bed, forcing one to get up and urinate.
The amount of peace a person has is equivalent to the amount of anxiety a person has in body and soul.
The lower the stress, the greater the energy to live. Everyone can find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The one thing that stands in our way of this stage is our attachment to self and our lack of self-confidence.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is supplemented by the Mahayana path of compassion and numerous methods derived from Indian Yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of indiscriminate love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of consciousness) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra and visualization.
Tibetan visualization practice is Yoga of the Divine. Through visualizing different deities, energy pathways are purified, chakras are activated, and the understanding of enlightenment is cultivated.
Germany was an enemy to many during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and America. At the end of the war, clashes in ideology and culture led to the separation of these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It should remain for the next 40 years before being sought by combat forces from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish armies were already defeated, and the only hope was to retreat, reorganizing on the Romanian bridgehead side.
However, these plans were rendered almost useless overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union Red Army entered and created the Belarussian and Ukrainian borders after invading the eastern territories of Poland in conflict with the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport cargo is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across coastlines.
The traditional role of navies has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time disrupting your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable examples was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to transport men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this transportation.
If the Allies had not been victorious, Germany could have defeated Britain because the rest of Europe was under its control.
Goats appear to have been domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them so they could easily access milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept as herds that roamed the hills or any pastures, herded by shepherds who were often children or young boys, much like the well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still widely used today.
Wagonways were originally built in England from the 16th century onwards.
Although the wagons had planks laid horizontally on their sides, they allowed horses to pull them at great speed and carry larger loads than on the difficult roads of those days.
Crossties were introduced early to hold the rails in place. Soon, however, it was realised that the tracks could work more effectively if they carried metal on top.
This was normal, but the iron caused extra wear on the wagon wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with metal ones. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The earliest form of travel was walking, and humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Those who preceded us, the Australopithecus, did not walk fully upright as we are accustomed to.
Bipedal expertise has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start to live in greater harmony with the environment, we can join an environmental organization, and we can become volunteers to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to treating symptoms most of the time. But, if we don't want a temporary solution, we must look for the root causes, so that we stop them.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the expensive lifestyles of people.
After its adoption by the Continental Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to nearby printers John Dunlap's shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first reading of this document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, with instructions that it be read to him and his troops in New York on July 9. A copy of it arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
But there are many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
From a technical perspective, all computers in use today rely on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numerical form.
A binary number consists of only two digits, namely 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits – or bits when used in computer programming language.
Internal poisoning may not show symptoms quickly. The symptoms, like vomiting, are so common that it can be mistaken for a normal illness.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning is the presence of containers of medicines or chemicals used in the home that are dangerous.
Check the first aid instruction label for specific poisons.
The photographers later took the place of the old woman as she needed the lavatory. Mendoza was shot down.
This name comes from the olden days from being associated with bedbugs, which are insects that can feed on humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are flightless, adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 people known to have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disorder in young to middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
The couple may decide it is not right for them, or thinking of their child, to raise him/her.
This couple can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
When a child is adopted, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of that child.
The primary goal of Science is to discover how the world works in a scientific manner. This approach guides the majority of scientific research.
It's not just speculation, experimentation is a test used to eliminate one or more assumptions, questions are asked, and observations are made that guide scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
The views of Aristotle on all matters of science, including psychology, were still acceptable.
Just as Greek knowledge declined, Westerners found themselves disconnected from their Greek intellectuals and their scientific roots.
Many people notice rhythms in appearance and behavior that depend primarily on the existence of endogenous cycles and their development over natural time.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external issues of specific times, are already programmed into many living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-made oscillators that will continue to run freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, marking either the DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various consequences depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material sequence affected, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only changes in the germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while changes elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people interested in visiting with the purpose of observing nature, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities that can take place on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about natural history.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the country's villages in cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by others who work where they have just left.
In this transformative transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected, together with support, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that the carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you constantly hear similar complaints about water quality and collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers unable to do their jobs? Or is there something more important happening?
Vehicle travel involves learning about the movement of each driver and vehicle from one place to another, and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, learning to predict traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior is not perfectly predictable.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave predictably within a reasonable range; However, road lanes tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To be a better representative of traffic flow, a relationship is established between three main features: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in planning, designing, and implementing strategies.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helps them easily avoid predators and find food more efficiently.
Most insects have a way of being able to fold their wings along the side of their body.
This gives them many small places to hide from other animals.
In these times, insects that cannot fold their wings are flies and mosquitoes.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and other stars).
She seems to be in her mind, because the Earth doesn't sound like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It has more than 8 times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is the largest river in the world, sometimes being up to six miles wide.
20 percent of all the fresh water that flows from the world's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It draws water from thousands of streams.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or in the perfect artistry with which they were built.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt was awed by its earlier monuments, which were over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City's population is 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the fewest people.
Vatican City uses Italian for administration and official correspondence.
Italian is also a language that is used freely by people who work in that country, and Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to work with using ancient tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, said that everything is made of a mixture of one to four elements. That is, earth, water, air and fire.
This was like the four states of matter (in the same sequence): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he thought they were changing into new things to create what we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Substances like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Yes, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also find alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything on Earth is made of matter. Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so small that trillions of them combined make a period at the end of a sentence.
Therefore, the pencil became a best friend to many people the day it was invented.
Sadly, as new writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser position and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, never getting close to a slate.
One might wonder what a keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a wheelbarrow uphill. Further splitting of the nucleus releases some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are constantly breaking apart with little or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The Earth is 70 km thicker at the equator and 100 km thicker on the far side.
It is thin under the bridge and thick under the higher areas.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates people to assign value or appeal to things.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that are kept internal as a person grows.
These theories look at what makes certain people do the things they do, and what factors in their environment cause them to act in certain ways.
Two popular theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behavioral approaches can emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum involves trying to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, evaluate performance, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
On the other hand, a person changes into someone unrecognizable who thinks they need to change everything the team used to do and do it their way.
Ultimately, a leader is always responsible for the success or failure of their team.
This behavior tends to create a divide between the leaders and the entire group.
Teams working online should meet the same standards as those working traditionally, but with slight differences.
Members of a suitable team act as a bridge to their physical team.
They tend to have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet at different times that are not understood by their local managers.
The existence of a "real invisible" team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also unique to the visible team.
"The Shadow Team" is the management team that officers report to. The Shadow Team sets the rate for each officer.
Why would an organization want to go the time-consuming route of establishing a learning organization? One purpose of putting organizational learning contracts in place is to design.
When all resources are used correctly across all departments of the organization, expertise and integrity become clear.
Therefore, an organization's system of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new process for serving customer needs.
Before the company innovates, management must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies that Business Process Reengineering is the most used method to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiology data provides tangible evidence for theories exploring the mind, thereby refining research and making it more focused.
The relationship between mental pathology and habits supports scientists in research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injury, lesions, and wounds affect behavior and cause changes in certain cognitive functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and investigate the structure of the brain and processes in ways never seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and tools to build simulation models that help us understand what's happening in our minds.
Although AI has a somewhat fictionalized perception in science, AI forms an important foundation in the field of computer science dealing with algorithms, learning, and machine intelligence.
Research in AI involves creating machines that can automatically perform tasks that require human intelligence.
Examples include managing, planning and scheduling, being able to respond to negative customer issues and queries, and being able to identify handwriting, matching a voice to a face.
Such things become distinct departments, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they are already built into computers and video game software.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Often the teacher likes to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can look at artifacts, visit an aquarium, or view fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Taking a trip is almost another way of reminding yourself and discussing ideas with future students.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capital, and every year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept on the Internet to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can help improve students' writing. Although students often come with their own blogging experiences that have poor grammar, and the inability to spell words correctly, writing for an audience often changes that.
Because readers are often critics with something to say, the blogger starts working on improving their writing style to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to feed the audience's interest encourages students to be creative and inquisitive (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration, and it encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school setting.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online resources, students can define their position in the context of others' texts and articulate their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a beautiful capital of Canada with people who speak two or more languages, several galleries, and museums showcasing Canadian history and contemporary works.
In the south lies Niagara Falls, and in the north, it's home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more show Ontario as a typical Canadian place.
Large areas in the north have few inhabitants, and some are almost uninhabited.
The comparison of the population is shocking to many: There are more African Americans living in the US than the entire population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the biggest, and is a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of these small islands become independent nations, or are affiliated with France, and are known for quality seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it took root in a big way in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that women travelling say they are married, regardless of whether they are married or not.
It also helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they perceive as abuse, such as being followed, arm-grabbing, etc., and it is not uncommon.
Be strong in confronting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but would abandon it again after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and general knick-knacks, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a popular tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the eastern side near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from Mount Nyiragongo which buried many of the town's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably secure, all travel outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as other less challenging mountains known for the African Gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The typical (local) price is 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Combined with its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has long been used as a metaphor for faraway, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its name makes it an attraction for tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world cultural heritage sites in danger, due to desert sand.
It was one of the main stopping points during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Africa's Great Civilizations".
This city doesn't agree at all with other cities in the country, because it is more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the borders of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the most attractive places in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African Parks, there are conservation and entrance fees for this park.
It is helpful for a person to buy a Wild Card, which allows you entry into certain parks in South Africa or into all National Parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is widely regarded by many tourists as the main focal point.
The multitude of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are comparable to a shimmering bar chart, reflected by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see Hong Kong better, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront in front of it.
Much of the development of Hong Kong Island has been built on reclaimed land from the northern sea.
This is the place that British colonialists took over, and so if you want evidence of the area's past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland into Bangladesh and also within India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not mangrove swamps, but they encompass the last remnants of the vast forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is now estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district station (across the river) all day, although in foggy conditions, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, they depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As district buses are usually full, you are advised to buy a ticket in advance.
Many districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are generally in good condition and travel comfortably.
Taking a shared taxi is a fast and enjoyable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two tall buildings rise to a height of 83 meters, and the 378-meter-long bridge has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide each.
The underpass clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection areas are also expected to be completed.
The Guarani were one of the most important indigenous groups living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and also using agriculture to survive.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", was established as a result of the invasion of Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its indigenous identity.
Argentina is known as one of the leading teams with the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Small tournaments and games can also be watched here at certain times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Island pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, past the FIC West store.
British Pounds are widely accepted everywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are usually accepted.
On the outer islands, paper money may not be accepted, but British and American currency may be; check with the owners before arrival to find out which payment method is adequate.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the island, so exchange your money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the tropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptive with its cold: temperatures don't usually drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is fairly consistent throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is wildlife and should not be disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how they may look, buffalo, elk, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack you.
Every year, tourists get injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are big, aggressive, and dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other forest animals, so avoid handling or cooking food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a naval standoff in 1889 when seven warships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for one British ship. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle that was being spearheaded by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering took place in town and resulted in the assassination of King Topua Tamasese Leaof III.
Auckland has a lot of coastline with swimming spots because it is situated between two harbours. The most popular spots are in three main areas.
The areas on the North Shore (in the North Harbour region) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches and safe for swimming. They also have shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's coastline is in the Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers, and is adjacent to St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes the beaches are usually filled with families and have various shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The local beer called "Buthatha indawo yokuqala" isn't strong, but it's delicious and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many wines available, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia are better.
Local tap water is generally safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
Australians don't understand the concept of 'weak, milky coffee'. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is topped with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standards. The fruit drinks are expensive but delicious.
There are whale watching tours available year-round, and injuries caused by these activities are rare in the area.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all instructions, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are present near the coast and in river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of this time of year.
Sharks are present, but they don't usually attack people. Many sharks are afraid of people and flee from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in seawater; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents have agreements with certain hotels, and you may also be able to book alternative accommodations, such as campsites, through travel agents.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer arrangements, or combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation while you need time to think about the gift or are still applying for other travel documents (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should first be directed to the travel advisor and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, many music festival attendees end up camping at the festival grounds, and many people who go consider it an important part of their experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music playing on the main stage is likely finished, there may be other areas of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have campsites prepared for families and children.
If you are going to travel to Northern Baltic in winter, check where the room is located, as travelling on snow causes terrible noise to those affected.
The Saint Petersburg trip includes time in the city. Travelers are exempt from visa requirements (see examples).
Casinos often make an effort to optimize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They often have special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and within their gates.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs one's ability to make sound decisions, so people who are serious about gambling will understand the importance of not drinking.
Anyone driving in high-lying areas or passing over mountains must consider the possibility of snow, frost, and freezing temperatures.
On roads with frost and snow, traction is low and you can't drive as if you're on dry tar.
In a cold snap, enough snow to trap you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may be poor due to snowfall or drifting snow, or due to moisture or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are common in many countries and traffic flow continues as normal without disruption throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist draw in Africa and notable for the large number of visitors.
The word safari refers to a trip through the country to view the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars, and regular equipment can allow you to see clearly.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs are usually shy and are best spotted with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "bushwalking", "hiking safari", or simply "walking") involves traveling long distances, possibly for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some of the games will be played in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice, having previously hosted in 1964.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you are likely in an uncertain situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, cancellations due to the coronavirus were not extending beyond July 2020, the period when the Olympic Games were supposed to take place.
Multi-entry tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular prices costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them to dry. Hotels usually have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not in your room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the cloth get too hot (which could cause it to shrink, or even burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are very effective at removing obvious impurities.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, boiling it for several minutes is necessary.
Water filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you're unsure, you should consider buying your own bottled water from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter animal species they are not familiar with in the local areas.
Insects can spoil food, cause nuisance, in severe cases cause allergies, inject venom, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are not considered a pandemic.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy things but not be charged tax, and it is done in certain places.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcohol or tobacco.
The stretch of road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, stay alert: steep downhills, narrow roads, and sharp bends are very common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than before, especially in the 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) range, and compliance is more important than ever.
But interestingly, cellphone systems are stronger here than in other areas, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are delicious, and in Bavaria, they are large and similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit preserves are common, apples are cooked into jam year-round, while strawberries and plums are made in the summer.
Some baked goods in Germany often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with strong coffee.
If you want a small but nutritious pastry, try the local one called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with spices and sautéed vegetables, to which meat or fresh vegetables are added.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the central regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes; in southern India and the coasts of the continent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Because there are 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a collective term that encompasses native food from the nation’s many regions.
Without additional clarifying words, the phrase refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes dishes that are subtly spiced, and the main seasonings for Javanese dishes are usually nuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and other fragrant spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider that hang down at foot level on the sides of the saddle.
They support the rider even more, but there are concerns about safety because the rider's legs could get caught in it.
If a rider falls from a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, there are many things that must be considered first.
Firstly, many passengers wear boots with heels and sharp, slippery soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety features that cause the leather straps to come loose from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley is a major rock climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, due to its diverse granite walls.
The high places include seeing things in a spectacular way at the summit. Climbers from all over the world are constantly pioneering new routes on its seemingly endless face.
Snowboarding, which includes jumps and riding on snow, is a popular sport that involves gliding down a snow-covered slope wearing skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
