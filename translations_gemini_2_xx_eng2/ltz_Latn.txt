At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the shopping television channel QVC.
The Ring also settled a lawsuit with a competing security company, ADT Corporation.
Although an experimental vaccine appears to reduce the Ebola mortality rate, no medications have yet clearly proven suitable for treating an existing infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially looked promising in the field, but formal studies have shown that it had fewer benefits in preventing death than previously thought.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs in their sport can be better served if we undertake meaningful change within our organization, instead of causing decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that reveals how abuse of that part so vaguely described by the survivors of Larry Nassar could remain undetected for so long and welcomes all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC pursue the same goal – to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowered environment.
In the 1960s, Brzezinski worked as an advisor to John F. Kennedy and then for Lyndon B. Johnson's administration.
During the 1976 election, he advised Carter on foreign policy, and from 1977 to 1981 he served as National Security Advisor (NSA), succeeding Henry Kissinger.

That not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The book also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft (called a quill), but did have other feather properties – barbs and barbules – researchers concluded that the quill was probably a later evolutionary development compared to those other properties.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample comes from adult feathers and not from the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the evidence points to adult feathers and not the down of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey. Two police officers died and more than twenty other people were injured.
The governor's office said: Nineteen of the injured were police officers.
The police said they suspect an alleged ISIS activist of being responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was driven by their luminosity, their rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

He did not set any figures for the reduction and said that they would be made on the basis of Chinese economic performance.
Hu encouraged developing countries "to avoid the old path of pollution first and then clean up later."
He added that "they should not, however, be asked to assume obligations that go beyond their level of development, their responsibilities and capabilities."
The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
He warns that no one can guarantee that all measures in Iraq at this time can stop the sectarian warfare, the increasing violence, or a slide into chaos.
The report begins with a plea for a public debate and the formation of a consensus in the United States on policy toward the Middle East.
The report is critical of almost all aspects of the executive's current policy towards Iraq and calls for a direct change of course.
The first of their 78 recommendations is that the new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the plant.
Local authorities are warning residents in the vicinity of the factory to stay indoors, turn off air conditioners, and not drink tap water.

This extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant "is very worrying and alarming because of the very high fatality rate."
Some patients may have been infected in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two were from the hospital staff.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the overall group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people in South Africa became infected at some point.

The police said that the body had apparently been lying there for about a day.
The first cases of the disease this season were reported at the end of July.
The disease is transmitted by pigs, which then pass it on to humans via mosquitoes.
The outbreak prompted the Indian government to take measures such as deploying pig catchers in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying pesticides.
The government also promised several million ampoules of encephalitis vaccine, which will help prepare the health agencies for next year.
The plans for the delivery of vaccines to the historically most affected areas this year have been delayed due to lack of funding and lower prioritization compared to other diseases.
In 1956, Słania moved to Sweden, where three years later he started working for the Swedish Post and became their chief engraver.
He produced over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and for 28 other countries.
His work is regarded as being of such recognized quality and attention to detail that he is one of the very few "household names" among philatelists. Some of them specialize exclusively in collecting his work.
His 1,000th timber was the magnificent "Grand Deeds of the Swedish Kings" by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl in 2000, which is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
He also worked on the engraving of banknotes for many countries, and the most recent examples of his work include the portraits of the Prime Minister on the front of the new Canadian 5 and 100 dollar bills.

All the cave entrances, which were called "The Seven Sisters," had a diameter of at least 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet).
Infrared images show that the temperature fluctuations between day and night prove that these are likely caves.
They are cooler during the day than the surrounding surface and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but they are consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law codifies the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the voting process and that no envelopes are added except for those from voters who are properly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to special procedures.

The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused were Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police president Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was meanwhile charged at the Sheriff Court Edinburgh with the murder of her son.
She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but all witness statements may be biased because his photo has been widely published.
That is common in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes "that journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions overall, informed journalists that no further comments would be given until the indictment.
According to the data leak, the document refers to the disputed border area that Palestine claims based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Further alleged topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence for ten years in the valley as soon as an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only wants to allow this presence for five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control study should be closely monitored by rangers, because the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Deputy Director for Park Protection and Heritage of the NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service), the four selected shooters received comprehensive instructions on the topics of safety and training for the first shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failed elections, which are partly overdue since 2011.
There have been approximately 60 cases reported of iPods overheating, which in total led to six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 further overheating incidents to them, which the company described as "non-concerning".
The ministry reacted to Apple's postponement of the report by calling it "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (Friday 9:19 AM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management said that no damage was reported throughout the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages were rescued, and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time.
His research showed that when a hormone was released, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Also other wrestlers paid Luna their last respects.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as I was… maybe even a little more… I loved her and miss her… hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic have seen an 8 percent increase since 2008.
The interim prime minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants share this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He was not able to take medication to overcome his pain because they are prohibited during the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Some people verified the discovery with the help of different hardware by the beginning of February, and that was announced on Tuesday.
Comets were possibly a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic substances that form proteins and can support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo took office as governor at the beginning of this year at 53 and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of tons of fuel, and reduce CO₂ emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to give pilots more accurate information.
There are no additional means of transport deployed and overground trains are not stopping at Wembley and parking spaces and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The fear of lacking transportation has increased the possibility that the game must be held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in Science on Thursday reported on the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although the process likely took much longer due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be worked with a hammer and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto other metals. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures and books, called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is referred to as the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using juice from red cabbage.
Red cabbage juice changes its color, depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (the H in pH value) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then press them with clean, wet hands into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feel bumpy and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, relics of wastewater systems were found.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women came together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the view.
A huge rocket of over 30 meters high is needed to bring a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in indescribable ways. The greatest advantage we owe to the wheel is much faster and easier transportation possibilities.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Among them are mid-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and red deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat the much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a specific task that each cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups, also called prides.
A pride consists of one to four adult males, together with up to thirty females and young.
The females are generally closely related to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to those of wolves or dogs – animals to which the lion (but not other big cats) is surprisingly similar in behavior – and they are also very deadly with their fangs.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather like a set of garbled, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move well. Ocelots hunt their prey by adapting to their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they move across a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island and thus cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so the new population needs new properties or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to their new surroundings, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable form and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses and produce our clothes from plants. The majority of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the gums, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a huge dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't take him on.
Although most of their food seems familiar to us, the Romans had many strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women sat on chairs and ate, the rich men liked to hold banquets together, where they reclined on their sides while eating.
Meals in ancient Rome could not contain any foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
They didn't have things like corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate chicken nuggets.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers – called ziggurats – were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not as important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the garden, the shops were only open selling counters onto the street. Stone was used for the construction of houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, as he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences with regard to people, kings, customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie 'National Treasure', then you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not correct, however. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. The text is located at the bottom of the reversed document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
It is therefore likely that the remark was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
He was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
And in less than two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civic, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and also somehow determines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization culture implies the passing on of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and an orderly dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind important historical evidence, and they are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation first formed a weak central government – the sole component of which was the Congress.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state agencies, which were often uncooperative, to implement all its actions.
He also had no authority to invalidate tax laws and excise duties between the states.
The clauses required unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government lightly, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the world champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the core production of the indigenous people and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which sovereignty over Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they used to look like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most commonly used photo format worldwide for still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but above all its aspect ratio has been adopted by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually, and you could round it a bit, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore denoted as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format family) conform to this aspect ratio or approximate it.
The often misused and frequently mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
She says that the most effective place for the main subject lies at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion held the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Her all-pervasive power affected everyone, from the King to the ordinary citizen.
One of the most important Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are specifically there for that reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from navigating entire sections of the ocean, which endangered even neutral ships.
Because there was only a limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to prevent a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA at Thomas Edison's with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job).
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different eras: Each phase of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an uncertain time with divided provinces. The best-known of these eras was the Epoch of the 'Three Kingdoms', which lasted 60 years and lay between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During this period, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were available for all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to make it.
The same applied to the military, because instead of army ranks based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also encouraged many other tyrannized workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was strongly interested in matters outside this worldly life. He repeatedly visited a cave known as 'Hira' on the mountain 'Noor' (Light) for contemplation.
Hell itself, which has survived the centuries, gives a very vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The hell lies on a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you knew it existed. Once you're in the hollow, you're completely isolated.
There is only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains to see. When one is in hell, one can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, are located several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor the wives and family members of Cheops.
The "circumflex accent" looks like a V and the "acute accent" looks like a bracket or a square, where the bottom side is missing.
Up bow means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down bow means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upstroke usually generates a softer tone, while a downstroke is stronger and more assertive.
Don't hesitate to indicate your own markings with a pencil, but don't forget that the printed bowing markings are there for musical reasons, so they should normally be adhered to.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and yelled threats against the King and Queen.
The mob of people forced the King and Queen to have their carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a participant in the mob held the head of a royal guard, murdered in Versailles, high in front of the terrified Queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, and a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government flowed through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super-profits that arise from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the fundamental achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events unfolded is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas and practices; from technology-push or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
One could say, for example, that the car inevitably led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs for vehicle owners.
Mass motorization also leads to a higher accident rate on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In connection with Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures arose that were connected to this geography, and which, because they stood in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renown as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Their status declined mainly during the twelfth century due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital was passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th to 11th and the 14th centuries.
Initially, Byzantine culture in the East had a very strong influence on clothing.
However, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is carried out to produce enough food only to satisfy the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that combines seeds originating from the ecoregion with crop rotation or uses other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together who feel neglected by societal standards, and they enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most frequently used methods to clarify the meaning of socialization is to refer back to a few fortunate cases of children who, through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse by adults, were not socialized while growing up.
Such children are called "feral". Some feral children were locked up by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' denial of severe mental or physical impairment.
Young runaways may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being given up or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When a feral child is raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely similar to those of the respective foster animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but a support that assists people who are having a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so are the small paperclip and Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and should question, prompt, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, social, and educational, but that is unfortunately the case.
We see the care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our care system should provide a safe home, caregivers who have a very warm manner, stable training, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in relation to the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, 'Learning' and 'Socialization' are considered important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal commitment' and 'ongoing relationships' were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to relevant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions – facial movements lasting only milliseconds.
Above all, it is claimed that one can recognize if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who cannot understand language due to brain damage are still able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities are shared in the interpretation of human behavior by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements with the available plant resources.
Moreover, if you don't do it, it has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins and leaves in leafy vegetables and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (grasshoppers, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide a wealth of proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in almost the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savanna.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of deliberately waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10–60 minutes later).
That can be achieved very simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you to consciousness, but not to fully wake you up.
If you reset the alarm clock while still sleepy, it can be placed on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The degree of underlying peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing vitality. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded through the Mahayana path of love and through many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is Guruyoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clashes of system, process, and culture led to the downfall of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had developed into enemies, which ushered in the Cold War.
It was to last the next 40 years and be fought out in proxy by the deputies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in countless other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union marched in and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The navy's mission traditionally consists of ensuring that their country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the ability of its enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to get men and material across the Atlantic to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried, mainly with submarines, to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been in a position to conquer Great Britain and the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and peoples kept them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, often cared for by goat herders, who were often children and adolescents, similar to the well-known shepherds. This method of herding is still used today.
Tunnels were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Although plank roads mainly consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and with larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early on to hold the rails in place. Gradually, however, it turned out that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
That became common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of transport was walking; humans began walking upright about 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 – 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may already have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join an environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
That is in many cases like a symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should eliminate them.
It is obvious enough that the scientific and technological advances of mankind have greatly changed the world, and the problems caused by overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of mankind have become greater.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks further to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known today as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that we know still exist are the oldest copies of the document. The handwritten original copy has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists are convinced that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are considered binary digits – or bits (to use computer language).
An internal poisoning is likely not immediately recognizable. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
On the label you will find specific first aid instructions for the respective poison.
The term Kiewerlek is used by entomologists in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are very strongly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nest dwellers that have adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may therefore decide that it is not in their best interest – or that of their child – to raise a baby.
These couples can decide to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights, so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to clarify how the world works through the scientific method. This method definitively guides most scientific research.
She doesn't do that alone, though. Experimenting - and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses - asking questions and making observations are also part of conducting scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all areas of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend crucially on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not simply reactions to external periodic cues have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that continue to run for a while even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, either labeling the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the affected genetic material, and depending on whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to drive to their workplaces and pass by those whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport hub, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now points to the fact that this massive carbon economy has disturbed one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported the evolution of humanity for the last 2 million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In industrialized countries, one rarely hears complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport planners simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, investigating traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main properties: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and to find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back along their body.
That offers them a wider range of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects whose wings cannot be folded back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people assumed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, in places almost 9.7 kilometers wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers worldwide into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical achievement of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City defers to Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Even in antiquity, people knew basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be found in nature in their natural form and can be extracted relatively easily with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more than the 4 states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma; although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, metals like silver and gold also exist.
There are also alloys with small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so surrealistically small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil has become less important and used with the development of new writing methods.
People now write messages on computer screens and no longer need a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart uphill. The renewed division of the cell nucleus then releases part of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they break apart with little or no provocation.
The Moon's surface consists of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner among the marls and thicker above the highlands.
There may be more seas on the far side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates people or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they have reached adulthood.
Considering this theory, what it has to do with certain people who want the things they want, and what things in their environment lead them to want or not want certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can arise when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum involves trying to remain 'one of the colleagues'.
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibility, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels they have to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, because their teams can meet according to the respective time zones, which is not necessarily understood by the local management.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each individual member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the time-intensive process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional areas of a company, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that serves the needs of the customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement process as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the research area and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
That provides us with a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, AI forms a very important area of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research encompasses the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on offering solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are frequently used today in the fields of economics, medicine, technology, and the military, but they are also built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every class. Often a teacher would like to bring their students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
Every year, for example, the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is rebuilt every year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog author starts striving to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to become more familiar with the world around them." The need to capture the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in the context of comments from others and also emphasize their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a host of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lie Niagara Falls and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what foreigners typically consider to be Canadian.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that is quite surprising: There are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadians.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself when it comes to flora and fauna.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or affiliated with France and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it was a long way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India around the Cape.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel zone, and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they might perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Don't be squeamish when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to assert yourself (cultural differences notwithstanding, that doesn't make it right!).
The present-day city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and Spanish merchants, who had established trading bases there, named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina you will find many places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, earthenware, leather goods, hookahs and a whole jumble of trinkets are sold, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that continues in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and also for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla excursions in Africa.
You can take a Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" became used as a symbol for exotic, far-off lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites due to the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the most important stations during the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities of the country, because it has more of an Arabian than African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park stretches over 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each providing for different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park here as well.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which offers access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph, accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed onto reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists claimed for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world and extend from the coast over 80 km (50 miles) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they encompass some of the last remaining stocks of the vast jungles that once stretched across the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans stretch over an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one third is covered with water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and over 30,000 axis deer in the area.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
As cross-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two 3.5 m wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group who lived in present-day Paraguay as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with native indigenous groups.
For the Spanish, the age of colonization began, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has preserved a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament will take place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check with the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which corresponds to that of a British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the 'FIC West' store.
The British pound is usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check in advance with the property owners what an acceptable payment method is.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, one should keep a distance of at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how tame they look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and just about all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous; so give them their space.
Furthermore, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking strongly scented foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia, with just under 40,000 inhabitants, is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the highest-ranking chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's two harbors. The most popular are located in three areas.
The 'North Shore' beaches (in the 'North Harbour' district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most offer shade thanks to Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
There are two local beers, the most important is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing; the other one is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that one must have tried, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might get there more easily.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a 'Flat White' coffee is exotic. A short black is called an 'Espresso', cappuccino has whipped cream (not foam) on top and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many excursions to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, ask the authorities for advice, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish have been coming to the beaches and estuaries from October to April since 1770. Sometimes you can find them outside of that time as well.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
When booking in advance, the traveler can be completely reassured that they will have somewhere to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals for specific hotels, although you can possibly book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include things like coffee, transport to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or obtain other documents for your travel destination (e.g. visa).
Changes or requests should be directed to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most of the music festival participants decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be right in the middle of the action, then you have to get up early to get a camping spot near the music.
Note that even if the music on the main stage is coming to an end, there may still be areas of the festival playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of your cabin, because driving through ice can cause quite gruesome noises for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time spent and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually missing and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and on the premises.
Some venues offer alcoholic drinks on the house. But alcohol impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive like you would on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or blowing snow, or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries and traffic usually continues undisturbed throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attractions in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term Safari in popular usage refers to overland journeys to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the savanna.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach cars closely, and standard equipment enables good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (other terms are "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "on foot") consists of hikes, either lasting a few hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after already hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, then you are likely in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if you're not in the room.
If no iron is available, or you don't feel like wearing ironed stockings, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful that the fabric doesn't get too hot (which could cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are different possibilities for water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests in their home regions with which they are not familiar.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in certain locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers who enter countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently leads through remote forests.
If you're used to driving on country roads, then keep your wits about you: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns abound.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections – typically 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph) – and adhering to them strictly is even more important than usual.
Oddly enough, the cell service here is much stronger than along other stretches, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are pretty good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are an everyday occurrence; apples are baked into pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums are added in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you are looking for small but rich pastries, then try what is offered as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, cooked together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can vary from "dry" to "like a sauce," depending on the liquid content.
In the banner regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the nation.
However, if it is used without further identification, the term usually refers to food from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widespread throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors of Javanese cuisine being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and hang on both sides of the saddle.
They offer more stability for the rider, but they can raise safety concerns because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but a foot gets caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged along if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, all riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, had safety stirrups that allowed a stirrup to fall away from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
Summits offer breathtaking views from the peaks. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes amidst the endless potential of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are occasionally also called "ski fanatics" and plan their entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to around 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first leisure ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing tours: This activity is also called ski touring, ski mountaineering, or ski hiking.
It is related to that, but is usually not associated with alpine ski-like tours or mountaineering, where the latter takes place on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine the ski slope as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover slightly greater distances than on foot – but you only very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to submit several visa applications and go through passport controls.
The Schengen Area functions similarly to a country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Exactly like that, with a Schengen visa you don't have to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member state, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which handmade objects are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit in countries like North America might be lower than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many with other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami were involved in reindeer herding on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, and largely kept reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the land of the Sámi.
Although widespread, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and the inaccurate perception of the Roma.
If the country you wish to visit is affected by a travel warning, this may affect your travel health or travel cancellation insurance.
Perhaps you also want to take the advice of other governments besides your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East might be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Reports are no more than a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
Those offered views are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Thunderstorms can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hailstones, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and whirlwinds.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are often advised to be aware of the danger of storms that may occur in their area, as they can affect travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
When searching the internet for "environmental awareness course," the address of a local company is likely to appear.
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, generally combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing and a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the wilderness are common, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or updated documents to reflect a changed name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents varies greatly.
Searches at security checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the time after September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to be able to go through the scanner and have their privacy and dignity remain intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break on the beach, often near a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow concentrates on a few deeper sections, and a rapid current can form there into the deep water.
Most fatalities are the result of exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be drawn back in, or depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, it might be advisable to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock sets in earlier and faster than culture shock (has less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be difficult.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers have to adjust in a new country.
People probably don't expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The Pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in peace before the show starts.
Normally, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The Sound and Light show's story is like a fairytale book.
The Sphinx is considered the background and narrator of a long narrative.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The ridges of the peninsula merge here with the plateau, then resurface again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, also called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson as its highest point at 4,892 m.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, because you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make calls.
The service is often used by shipping, including recreational boats, as well as expeditions that have a need for external data and speech recognition.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you further information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year abroad is to travel and learn.
That is particularly popular with high school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, registering for a year abroad can actually improve your chances of higher education when you return home.
Normally, tuition fees apply to enroll in these study programs.
Finland is a wonderful excursion destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has several thousand islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for yachts, smaller boats or simply a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, with one boat for every seven to eight people.
That can be found in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g., the number in the Netherlands is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days while sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on ship excursions, then you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises advertise with Berlin (Germany) in the brochures. However, as you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located on the sea and the price of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: It is no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that many other people have.
For some, understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear of the unknown or of having no control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Time is often critical for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the largest companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
When they sent things by air freight, it could take days on some routes before everything was unloaded and passed through customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow you to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious thing about having the option to fly in first or business class is spending a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, having your company pay for it).
That won't be cheap, though: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times as much as for Business Class and eleven times as much as for First Class!
Generally, it makes no sense to even look for discounts on Business or First Class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core of air travelers – who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably – and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The national language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.

Economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
İzmir, with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, is the third-largest city in Turkey, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades, and the modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a European Mediterranean atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík, with a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, has an extraordinary octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on some graves.
It's worth wandering through the fascinating village for half an hour.
Located in the north and easy to reach, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous for foreigners after a fiery depiction of its splendor, recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops in Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you should also visit the important Sanctuary of Fátima (shrine), a world-renowned place for Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that has an almost incalculable significance for another part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who outlived their time here, and many more who were murdered or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect that it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching the structures with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the people speak Catalan, a very large proportion understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the primary official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced through an automated system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still to put your best foot forward and behave like a "bien élevée" (well-mannered) person. It simplifies everything considerably.
That abrupt demeanor of the Parisians quickly vanishes if you are a little polite.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests – especially beech, spruce and fir – and exhibits a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the capercaillie can be found there, along with many other species.
During the visit to the monasteries, women must wear skirts that go past the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide a shawl for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a colorful one, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Men must also wear boxer shorts that go past the knees.
You can also borrow that from the stock at the entrance, but the clothing isn't washed after every use, so you might not feel comfortable when you put the skirts on. One size fits all for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns next to the word 'Sie' for 'Dir' always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
That is a very important possibility to differentiate between several verbs and objects.
It probably also simplifies reading, although writing is a little more complicated due to the necessity of figuring out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure that you pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: 'caro' means 'dear', but 'carro' means 'car'.
Persian has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese becomes easier.
However, people who speak little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and are preserved as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't as much of a problem in their heyday as it is nowadays, they were usually located in cities or on campuses and were easier to reach than those that are being built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, called Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the Emperor held the first cherry blossom festivals just for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally designed garden, you will undoubtedly be thrown out if you collect "specimens".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to live, and very easy to navigate and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
However, because it is located in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to cope with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to plan a vacation.
You could, for example, visit the castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat tour on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night at an exposed point to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on the Saturday during Easter weekend, where communities often celebrate the resurrection of Christ at the stroke of midnight.
All animals that originally came to the island either swam, flew, or drifted on the water.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the Galapagos giant tortoise the first grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, then you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
That offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, because the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you are also able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and more formal than what people from the West are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and employees address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial and emphasizes group efforts instead of praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get approval from their superior for every decision they make, and they are expected to follow their superior's instructions without question.
