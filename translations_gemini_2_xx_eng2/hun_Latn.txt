This not only confirms that some dinosaurs were feathered, as that theory was already widespread, but also sheds light on details that fossils are generally unable to reveal - such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top, and light or orangey in hue on the sides.
The discovery could also provide insight into the evolution of birds' plumage.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis, what is called a shaft, but possess other feather characteristics - barbs and barbules - researchers have concluded that shafts are likely a later evolutionary development compared to these.
The structure of the feather suggests it was used not for flight, but for thermoregulation or display. Researchers determined that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample indicates adult plumage, not that of a chick.
The researchers suggested that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample indicates adult plumage, not fledgling plumage.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The expert group tried to verify the existence of an effect between the tidal phenomenon of the galaxy's dark matter and the tidal phenomenon of the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way affect the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter throughout the galaxy exists as a kind of halo around galaxies and consists of many tiny particles.

"During the day they are cooler, and at night they are warmer than the surrounding surface."
"“From a temperature point of view, they are not as uniform as large caves, which often have almost constant temperatures, but this is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing, who is with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona."
In France, elections traditionally involve little technology: voters seclude themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper slip bearing the name of their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law regulates the process quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that they are empty before voting and that only properly registered and eligible voters can deposit envelopes.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all stages of the process. The votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict supervision, adhering to well-defined procedures.

Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, whose mobile and laptop we recovered."
The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while paramedics freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, he was treated at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged at Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
He is in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be compromised, as his image has been widely publicized.
This is standard practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently, and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
According to Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, "journalists are treading a dangerous path if they publish photos or the like of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service responsible for criminal proceedings has indicated to journalists that they will no longer speak about the case before the indictment.
According to the leaked information, the document concerns the territorial claim that Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Reportedly, among the other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA is only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters participating in the supplementary pest control experiment, along with the gamekeepers, were kept under strict supervision as the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
The NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) jointly recruited trained volunteers under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, said the four shooters selected for the first cull operation received comprehensive safety and practical training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new, nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous CEO as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases were reported where malfunctioning iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and minor burn injuries to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
In its response, the ministry called the postponement of Apple's announcement "sincerely regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 AM local time (Friday, 19:19 Greenwich Mean Time).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked their bus and took Hong Kong tourists hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Numerous hostages were rescued, but the deaths of at least six others were confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady, as the lady had to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature birth in his free time.
The research showed that administering a hormone can accelerate the development of a baby's fetal lungs.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two black boxes on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. She was very unique, just like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was at least as eccentric as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place now."
Ahead of the 2010 federal election, the proportion of the 1400 people surveyed who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of voters share the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
According to the extreme values of the public opinion poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist swimmer would have competed in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, doubts have arisen about their fitness.
He couldn't take the medications he needed to overcome the pain because they are banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Numerous people checked the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, which was then announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the biggest carriers of water to Earth, along with the organic materials that form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially the Earth's creation, after comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship at the beginning of the year and signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and foolishness."
Some say he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to determine the position of aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no extra transport options; overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available.
Fears related to the lack of transport raised the possibility of the game being played compulsorily behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported on the emergence of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported the emergence of a new species resulting from the hybridization of the native medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and an invasive species, the large cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris). Although it was previously believed that this process would take much longer, the new species evolved in just two generations.
Gold can be shaped into any form and can be worked even at tiny sizes.
It can be drawn into thin wire that is easily twisted and stranded. It also allows for forging or rolling into sheets.
It can be shaped into a very thin form and adheres to other metals. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. An indicator can be made from red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions in the tested chemical (the H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons formed by the loss of electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then press them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on our hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a strange feeling and forming a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet that was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan towns on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women mingled together.
When you call someone on the phone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and sends it back to Earth almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use astronomical telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
A giant rocket taller than 100 feet is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has brought incredible changes to the world. The biggest thing we can thank the wheel for is much easier and faster transportation.
This brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats, which consume medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cat species (including domestic cats) also eat significantly more small prey items such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept, a specific activity that every cat adheres to, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat species, and they live in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three related males, and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females usually bond more strongly with each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Surprisingly, lion prides behave very similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are similar to lions in their behavior (but not like other big cats), and they are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-balanced athlete, the tiger is able to climb trees (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger (Genus Panthera) belongs to the same group as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four big cat species are the only ones whose members can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather like a sentence composed of snarled and shouted words.
Ocelots readily consume small animals. If they can, they will also catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots find their prey by following their scent and sniffing along the ground.
They can see very well in the dark because they have night vision and move stealthily. The leopard cat hunts its prey by blending into its environment and then pouncing on its victim.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is isolated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island and cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different characteristics or adapt in order to be a stronger competitor than it needed to be previously.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and they still require the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it will become less and less similar to the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants are capable of producing oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out.
Plants obtain their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants too. Most of the food we eat is also plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't survive either.
The mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except another mosasaurus.
More than seventy razor-sharp teeth protrude from its long jaws, and another row is located on the roof of its mouth, ensuring nothing that gets in its way escapes.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs; it may even have been a cannibal.
At the same time, it attacked anything that got into the water; even a dinosaur as mighty as the T. rex was no match for it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual festive feast dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent, the dormouse.
The other difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to organize feasts where they would converse and snack together, side by side.
Ancient Roman dishes could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered the god's home.
People made sacrifices to the gods and their priests, and tried to satisfy the needs of the gods with rituals and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower served as a special sanctuary for the deity.
Due to the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not as important.
Much of the life of Hebrew families took place outdoors.
The cooking was done by the women in the yard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was considered an extremely precious treasure.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and Icelandic people, kings, customs, and histories differed in many ways.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was recorded on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document."
Although the identity of its writer is uncertain, it is known that shortly after its completion, the large (29 and a quarter inches long and 24 and a half inches wide) parchment document was stored rolled up.
So, it's likely that the label was simply added as a tag.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
These "Vichy" French controlled it. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, and the invasion was codenamed "Operation Dragoon".
In barely two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is that unique culture that is shared among a larger group of people who live and work together in a society.
The origin of the word "civilization" comes from the Latin words "civilis," "civis," and "civitas," which mean citizen, inhabitant, and city or city-state, respectively, the latter of which also defines, to some extent, the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture encompasses the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first created a weak central government - with Congress being its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, nor did it have a national executive or judicial branch, and therefore it often relied on reluctant state authorities to enforce its laws.
He had no authority to overrule tax laws or tariffs between states either.
The amendment of the fundamental law required the unanimous consent of all states, but the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often abstained from meetings.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national football team, and they won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Thanks to the cluster/grouping of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's history begins in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by note the island's name - Ilha Formosa - meaning Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, reformed the indigenous people's grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) takes control of western Taiwan and the northern coastal areas and declares Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main parts: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was a defining film size at the twilight of the analog film era.
Its production continues even today, but what is important is that the format of digital camera image sensors has adopted its aspect ratio.
The 35mm format actually, somewhat confusingly, refers to a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (after dividing by 12 to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) can be set to 3:2.
Numerous common formats (such as the APS format family) match or approximate this aspect ratio.
The often misused and frequently ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
It claims that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states, despite linguistic and customary differences.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should specifically serve this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and seeing this concentration of power and money, many have questioned whether its fundamental teachings are being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated general international laws established in several international agreements of the previous two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from accessing its full oceanic territories, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare as well.
During the 1920s, the dominant behavioral pattern among citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities caused by World War I, the nations will avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had nothing but a book of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former boss).
Ancient China had a peculiar way of presenting its different eras: each era and each ruling family in Chinese history was a distinct dynasty.
Between dynasties, there was an uncertain age of divided territories. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, several nobles vying for the throne engaged in fierce battles with each other.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, where thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in Xi'an Palace.
The decimal system has a huge social and political impact, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief in the country belonging to the people and not a sole ruler.
Following the revolution, professions opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to prevail.
The same applies to the military, since instead of the army's hierarchy being determined by class, it was now based on merit.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed working-class members in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed showed a deep interest in things beyond worldly life. He regularly went to a cave on the ""Noor"" (light) mountain, which became known as ""Hira"" as a place of contemplation.
He is the very cave that has weathered the ages and provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca is completely isolated from the outside world.
What's more, even if you knew it existed, it wouldn't be easy to find. As soon as we enter the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing else can be seen except for the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. This world is seldom seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing.
The great pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramids built to honor deceased pharaohs.
On the Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), as well as several small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "pull up" symbol is V-shaped, and the "pull down" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Upwards means you should start at the mountain and press the bow, downwards means you should start at the frog (where you hold your hand on the bow) and pull the bow.
An "upstroke" generally produces a softer sound, while a "downstroke" is stronger and more defined.
Feel free to mark your notes in pencil, just remember that the printed bowing marks are there for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified Louis XVI, Queen Maria Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Maria Theresa and the four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
Suddenly, before the horrified queen's very eyes, a member of the crowd was shaking the head of a member of the royal guard, who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
To cover a large portion of the expenses, they had to pay taxes to the American colonial government, and bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government drifted to Wall Street banking houses.
Naturally, the super-profits came from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people, and these constituted the fundamental profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the Order.
The period of events is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, conventionally ending around 1500.
Technological determinism in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas; in its more stringent form, often called technological imperative or technological inevitability, it conveys the sense that human destiny is governed by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that, on the other hand, technology has "impacts" on societies, and these impacts are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, there's also the opinion that motor vehicles necessarily lead to road development.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable with few cars, so new manufacturing methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
However, mass car ownership also leads to high numbers of road accidents, which encourages the invention of new techniques in healthcare aimed at healing injured bodies.
Cultural determinism constituted a significant part of Romanticism, and it drew inspiration from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture tied to a specific geographical location developed, which, being in harmony with the community's place, proved better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, so Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its position deteriorated in the 12th century, primarily because the crusading knights rejected suspicious gifts such as silk and spices, which they valued more than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that Paris took the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The peak period of the Gothic style lasted from the 10th-11th centuries to the 14th century.
The clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine and Eastern culture at the beginning.
However, due to slow communication methods, styles in the West could lag behind by as much as 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is farming carried out to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds and crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques common in the ecoregion to maximize yield.
Throughout history, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and enable the development of self-esteem within them.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Subcultural characteristics can be defined by linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical differences, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership with a recognizable symbolic style, which includes fashion, behavioral patterns, and the use of slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the unfortunate examples of a few children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, have not been able to socialize in the company of adults as they grew up.
We call such children feral or unmanageable. Some feral children were isolated from people (often their own parents), occasionally the abandonment of the child was due to parental rejection because of the child's severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have been raised among animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If not raised entirely by non-human animals, in the wild, a child living within physical constraints almost entirely adopts the behavioral patterns of the animal that cares for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a form of assistance that provides support to those who are engaging in a new learning experience, such as learning to use new software or embarking on a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is also a kind of "scaffolding", but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds were built into the software, which aims to question, lead the student to question, and explain the procedures that would have challenged the student when completing the task independently.
Children are placed in orphanages for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
A child should never be allowed to grow up in a non-nurturing, uncaring, and unsupportive environment, yet it still happens.
We consider foster care a safe haven for these children.
Our goal in foster care is a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and a reliable healthcare system.
Orphanages must provide all the needs that were lacking in the previous home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet lead to further possibilities from the perspective of the uses and gratifications model.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also considered new motivational factors in Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study, which focused on audience reactions to websites."
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Especially if they claim that some people can accurately tell if someone is lying based on certain facial expressions.
In his essay, "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out that people with brain damage, who are unable to understand speech, are very accurate at perceiving sincerity.
He also claims that the ability to interpret human behavior can be found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two variations of genetic diversity: hidden and expressed.
Mutation provides the opportunity for new genetic variation, while selection removes from the pool of expressed variation.
Mixing segregation and recombination, with forward and backward variation between the two gene pools in each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to satisfy their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
What is more, there are serious consequences if this is not fulfilled: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, it wouldn't be surprising if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking from the usual sleep cycle and returning to sleep within a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock, bringing about a state of alertness without fully waking you up.
If you reset the alarm in your dream, put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based possibility is to consume a lot of fluids (especially water, tea, which is a well-known diuretic) before sleep, which forces the person to urinate at night.
The degree of inner peace possessed by a person is inversely proportional to the degree of tension between the body and the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the opportunity to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. Only our own tension and negativity can prevent us from reaching this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded with the Mahayana path of compassion and many techniques originating from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is, in principle, very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity yoga is at the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of numerous deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and self-awareness is illuminated.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. At the end of the war, due to differences in systems, methods, and cultures, the countries clashed.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
For the next 40 years, it lasted, and proxy armies clashed in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was withdrawal and reorganization through the Romanian bridgehead.
At the same time, these plans were declared obsolete virtually overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after overrunning eastern Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and vast quantities of goods across the oceans.
Naval forces have traditionally worked to ensure a nation's ability to move people and goods, while hindering the enemy's ability to do the same.
One of the most memorable and recent examples of this is the World War II North Atlantic campaign. The Americans tried to cross the Atlantic with men and raw materials to help the English.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, primarily with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as well, as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for their easily accessible source of milk, as well as for their fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often under the supervision of child or adolescent goat herders, similarly to the more widely known shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
In England, railways were already being built in the 16th century.
Although the trackways consisted only of parallel planks laid down, they allowed horses to pull faster and heavier loads on them than on the relatively few, bumpy roads of the era.
The connecting elements were used quite quickly to keep the track in place. At the same time, they slowly realized that it would be more efficient to put a piece of iron on it.
This became an everyday practice, but the iron took a greater toll on the wagon's wooden wheels.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking on two legs two million years ago, at the same time as the appearance of Homo Erectus.
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not yet habitually walk upright.
Bipedal speciations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is often like treating the symptoms. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate it.
It's quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and humanity's luxurious lifestyle.
Following its presentation to Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
John Nixon first read the document aloud in public in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. The copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap pages, which are still known today, are considered the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived. These are the birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they are feathered and able to fly.
Birds still look similar to dinosaurs in many ways.
They have scaly and clawed feet, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Virtually every computer used today is based on handling information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, which are called binary digits or bits in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning is not necessarily immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The surest sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to that poison.
Entomologists use the term "bogár" in an official sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects excellently adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are both nidicolous, meaning they are suited to nest-building or they use the host organism.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may also decide that it is not in their interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their baby.
Upon adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works using scientific methods. This method is essentially the basis of most scientific research.
However, it's not solely comprised of that. Experimentation, and an experiment being a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations, also aid scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek language skills, the West cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The majority of rhythms detectable in physiology and human behavior are significantly dependent on the occurrence of endogenous cycles and their production during the biological cycle.
Periodic rhythms can be observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and these rhythms are not merely reactions to external periodic cues.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues free-running cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence supporting the theory that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted in which the phage DNA was labeled with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein was labeled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the nature of the mutation, the importance of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in natural sites and enjoy the scenery, including the flora and fauna.
On-site programs include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and learning about ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing, and getting to know Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to get to their workplaces, passing by those whose workplace is the very place they just left.
In this dynamic commuter traffic, everyone is connected to everyone else in some way, and supports the transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science suggests that these massive carbon dioxide emissions have displaced the biosphere from the stable state that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone has complaints about them.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they go bankrupt daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there some fundamental flaw?
Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally tend to behave within a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows usually have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, a relationship was found between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, development, and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantageous characteristic of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This offers them more space to hide from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their hind wings.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you can't feel the Earth spinning, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth. Its water discharge is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching 6 miles in width in some places.
20 percent of the river water flowing into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and structural excellence of the Giza pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians living during the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments built by their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has a population of approximately 800 people. It is the smallest and least populous independent country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of people working in the state, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People knew basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper already in ancient times, since each of these can be found in nature in raw material form, and can be mined relatively easily even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he thought they would become new, visible materials to us.
An alloy is fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. It should be noted that there are numerous chemical elements in the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium, and similar elements are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals as well, such as silver and gold.
Some alloys may contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil served many people well when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and is used less.
These days, people write messages on computer screens and never come near a pencil sharpener.
We can only speculate what the keyboard will be like if they come up with some newer development.
A fission bomb works on the principle that colliding an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's like we're rolling a heavy cart uphill. The renewed fission of the atomic nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they sometimes split apart due to a small impact or even on their own.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the plateaus.
It is possible that there is more black rock in the nearby part because the crust is thinner. It is easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what motivates people or what piques their interest.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized during adulthood.
These theories examine what it is that motivates certain people to want the things they do, and what in their environment compels them to do those things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when leaders begin to manage their former peers. One end of the spectrum is when they try to "remain one of the guys" (or girls).
Such a leader finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary proceedings, perform performance reviews, define responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, someone transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels the need to change everything the group has created and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for their team's success or failure.
This behavior often creates conflict between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams' performance indicators are measured by the same standards as traditional teams', but there are some slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons to direct physical team contacts.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, as their teams can meet across different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique characteristic of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the leading team to whom the members report. The invisible team sets the standard for the members."
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One goal of implementing learning concepts in organizations is innovation.
When an organization efficiently utilizes all available resources across its functional departments, creativity and resourcefulness can emerge.
As a result, the process of collaborating to overcome obstacles within the organization leads to a new, innovative process designed to satisfy customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum principle as a method that can help organizations achieve greater performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to studying cognition, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' observations.
It has long been known that various brain damages, traumas, injuries, and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in certain cognitive abilities.
The rise of new technologies allows for the observation of brain structures and processes that were never before seen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material, which we can use to build simulation models to understand what processes are taking place in our minds.
Despite its strong science fiction connotations, AI is actually a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
For example, directing, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on solving real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economic, medical, technical, and military fields, as well as being incorporated into numerous home computers and video game software.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Teachers often and happily take their students to places where a bus trip isn't feasible.
Technology enables virtual field trips. Students can view museum artworks, visit an aquarium, or admire any work of art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtually sharing the experience of a class trip with others is also a great way to reminisce about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital, redesigning the website every year, but like a yearbook, they keep the old versions available online.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since the most critical audience often comes from the ranks of students, the blogger considers improving writing skills crucial to avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them." Maintaining audience interest encourages students to be witty and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to significantly extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs can "prepare students to become more analytical and critical; actively responding to online materials can help students define their stance in relation to the writing of others" and their own viewpoints on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's charming bilingual capital, boasts numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, while to the north is Muskoka, with its untapped natural beauty.
These, along with many other things, present Ontario in an authentic Canadian light to foreigners.
Further north, one finds vast, sparsely populated areas and sometimes almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
A population fact that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean, close to the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest landmass in terms of wildlife, and could be considered a continent in its own right.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent nations or affiliated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam with them to the territories, and it gained significant ground in the Comoro Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The northern part of the region is bordered by the Sahel, while the western and southern parts are bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say they are married regardless of their marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in things they might perceive as harassment, and it's not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences aside, that still doesn't make it acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and under the name Anfa, it was used as a strategically important port by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and then rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it in 1755 due to an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Baida, and Spanish merchants gave it the name Casablanca and established their trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of trinkets, but everything here is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is necessary to inquire about the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province before visiting outside of Goma.
The city is the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and it's also one of the cheapest places in Africa for gorilla trekking.
For transportation within Goma, you can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). A typical (local) fare for a shorter trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative isolation, "Timbuktu" is also used metaphorically to describe exotic, remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the encroaching desert sands.
This was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS series "Wonders of the African World."
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it exudes more of an Arabic atmosphere than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each home to different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's national parks.
As in all South African national parks, a conservation and entry day fee must be paid here.
It might also be useful to purchase a "Wild Card", which allows you entry to either the selected South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong got its name from Hong Kong Island, and this place is the focus of attention for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that shapes the Hong Kong skyline resembles a glittering bar graph, further accentuated by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best possible view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The urban area of Hong Kong Island is largely densely concentrated along the northern coast on reclaimed land.
This is the place that was occupied by the English colonizers, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, extending 80 km inland from the coast into the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has become a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just made up of mangrove swamps - here are also some of the last strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the entire Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km², about one-third of which is covered by water/marshy areas.
The Sundarbans area has served as a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As inter-district buses often get full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese coastal buses operate, which are comfortable and have a high load capacity.
Share taxis are a fast and convenient solution for visiting nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two 3.5-meter-wide traffic lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, which is when the completion of the Brazilian customs clearance points is estimated.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group who lived as semi-nomadic hunters in present-day Eastern Paraguay, also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
16th-century Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indians," came into being as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish initiated the colonization phase, which lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to retain a significant part of its indigenous features and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best water polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament series will be held in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
Less prestigious competitions and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news regarding the championships and to purchase tickets for polo matches, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Island pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Currency exchange is only possible at the islands' only bank, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on and around the islands, and it is often possible to pay with Stanley bank cards and US dollars as well.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the more remote islands, although British and American currency may still be taken. It is worth checking with the owner beforehand what form of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it experiences summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to encountering people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, keep a distance of at least 100 meters from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they need to be given their space.
In addition, it's important to know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so be careful not to cook or bring intensely scented foods, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for a single British battleship. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed at a peaceful gathering in the city.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is surrounded by two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north all the way to Devonport in the south.
Swimming is safe at almost all sandy beaches, and most provide shade from pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with many different shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is called 'Number One'. It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can buy a lot of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
The concept of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black is called an 'espresso', a cappuccino is piled high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian expectations. The fruit juices are expensive, but they are of excellent quality.
The shoal is visited by many tourists throughout the year, yet injuries rarely occur.
Despite this, follow the advice of the authorities, obey the instructions on the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish have been found near beaches and river mouths between October and April since 1770. Occasionally, they can be found elsewhere during these times.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and prefer to move away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their primary habitat is river estuaries, north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have unique deals with certain hotels, although it is also possible to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and accommodation deals.
We can hold the booking for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents required for the destination (such as a visa).
Please send any modifications or requests to your travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At certain music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on-site, and indeed, most consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a campsite close to the music.
Don't forget that even though the concert has finished on the main stage, there may be areas of the festival where music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the cabin's location, as navigating through ice can be terribly noisy for those who are too close.
A sightseeing tour is part of the St. Petersburg circular routes. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos generally make significant efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in good spirits and on the premises.
In certain places, alcoholic beverages are also offered free of charge. However, intoxication impairs one's judgment, and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone leading at high altitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can't drive on them the same way as on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, so much snow can fall in a very short time that it causes obstructions.
Visibility may be limited by snowfall or snowdrifts, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic flows smoothly throughout the year.
African safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist attractions and offer an outstanding experience for visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to overland journeys with the aim of viewing the magnificent wildlife of the African wilderness, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as giraffes and elephants, venture close to the cars, making them easily observable even with average equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they are better seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "on-foot safari") consists of hikes lasting a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having previously hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a strange situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not cover July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled.
Event tickets are expected to generally cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with the typical ticket price being around ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available, which you can use even if there isn't one in your room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Caution, do not overheat the fabric (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for even just a minute is enough, while in others, more time is needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, consider buying water in sealed glass bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they may not have previously encountered in their home.
Pests can ruin food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, and can spread poison or infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to purchasing goods without paying taxes and duties at specific locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy tax burdens can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the biggest driving challenge on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated, godforsaken areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns characterize the road.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections—typically 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is extremely important.
It is interesting, however, that the signal strength is much stronger here than in other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are very good; in Bavaria, they are prepared in a rather rich and varied way, resembling their southern neighbors, Austria, in this respect.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are baked into cakes year-round, while cherries and plums are typically used in cakes during the summer.
Many German baked goods, however, contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The more popular pastries often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you'd like some small but satisfying pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, and is prepared with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "soupy" depending on how much liquid it contains.
In northern India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry preparation, while in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers the vast array of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without other qualifications, the term most often refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely present throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes in which the flavors of Java are dominated by peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hanging on either side of the saddle support the rider's legs.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but their use raises safety concerns because the rider's foot can get caught in them.
If a horse throws its rider but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them along if it continues galloping. There are several safety precautions we can take to minimize this risk.
First, most competitors wear riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
After this, some saddles, particularly English saddles, are fitted with safety bars which allow the stirrup leather to come away from the saddle if the rider is dragged during a fall.
The Cochamó Valley is a prominent climbing destination in Chile, known as the "Yosemite of South America," featuring a variety of large granite walls and cracks.
The peaks of the mountaintops offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes on the walls that offer endless possibilities.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with a significant fan base, whose enthusiasts are sometimes referred to as "ski lovers," and they plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers can be traced back to as early as 5000 BC!
The origin of downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, with the first recreational ski club being opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backcountry skiing: also known as ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It is related to, but not usually associated with, alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which take place on steep terrain and with much stiffer skis and boots.
Interpret the ski route as if it were a hiking trail.
In good conditions, it will be able to cover a greater distance than walking - but it will rarely reach the speed required for cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent with a high number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this zone, you generally won't need to go through passport control points again when crossing borders.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to obtain a separate visa for each Schengen member state, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as objects that are 100 years or older.
The definition varies geographically, and in some places this age limit is shorter than the European one, such as in North America.
We could define handcrafted products as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding was - and still is - an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the industry is important to many people who pursue other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sami people participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami area of Sápmi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you wish to visit is subject to a travel warning, this may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
Furthermore, you can also seek the advice of other governments, but these governments tailored their advice to their own citizens.
As an example, American citizens of Middle Eastern descent may experience differential treatment from Europeans and Arabs.
The briefings are merely short summaries of a country's political situation.
The views presented are often short, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is an umbrella term for dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or even loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are several types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are manifestations and consequences of extreme weather, along with thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks affecting the area, as these may impact their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country considered a war zone should consider taking professional training beforehand.
If you search for "Hostile Environment Course" online, you will likely get the address of a local company.
The course generally covers all the problems discussed here in much greater detail, often combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes even weapons training.
Books and magazines on the theme of wilderness survival are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Passengers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
Individual governments differ in their approach regarding whether they are willing to issue passports where gender is not marked (X), or to issue documents that contain the new name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is just as variable.
Security screenings at checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people facing surgery cannot count on their privacy and dignity not being violated when passing through body scanners.
Rip currents are strong, localized, and narrow currents of water moving away from the shoreline, often occurring near sandbars or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, the returning flow is compressed in some deeper sections, and a rapid current can develop there in the deep water.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion when they try to swim against the current, which is almost impossible.
Once it's out of the current, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where the current won't carry you away again, or - depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed - it might be worth waiting for rescue.
Reverse culture shock occurs much sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Those travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own, original culture.
Upon returning home after spending time abroad, they adapt to the new culture and abandon some habits from their home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding with you and aware that travelers visiting an unfamiliar country need to adjust.
People probably don't think that returning travelers need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
We can see the pyramids in the dark and quiet, even before the show starts.
Usually, you can always hear the voices of tourists and vendors here. The story told through sound and light is just like one from a fairytale book.
The sphinx provides the backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the highest concentration of bases, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, Livingston Island and Deception Island belong here, the latter's still active volcano's flooded caldera forming a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge with the plateau, then rise again, forming the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
Located in the northern part, or Sentinel Range, is the highest mountain range of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, crowned by the 4892m-high Vinson Peak.
In remote locations with no cell service, a satellite phone might be the only solution.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace mobile phones, as you need to be outdoors with an unobstructed view of the satellite to make calls.
The service is frequently used in navigation, including recreational boating, as well as expeditions where data and voice telecommunications are required.
Your local phone company can provide you with more information about connecting to the service.
Taking a gap year for travel and study is becoming an increasingly popular option.
This is especially popular among graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their studies.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase your chances of being admitted to higher education upon returning to your home country.
Participation in these educational programs is usually subject to tuition fees.
Finland is a great boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of small islands in its lakes and coastal archipelago.
In archipelagos and on lakes, a yacht is not necessarily required.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for yachting, smaller boats or even kayaks can offer a different kind of experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and about one in every seven or eight people owns a boat.
This is also the case for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most popular Baltic Sea cruises offer an extended stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a couple of days, spending the night on the ship.
If you only disembark with boat trips, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures offer Berlin, Germany as a destination. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be daunting for people of any age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There's no need to be ashamed of this: it's the same as personal fears, or when we don't like something - a lot of people feel the same way.
For some, a partial understanding of how aircraft operate and the events that occur during flight can help overcome the fear rooted in a lack of knowledge or control.
Courier companies pay well for fast delivery. Time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or parts for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own planes for certain routes, however, there have been problems on other routes and with smaller companies.
When things are sent by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days for the goods to be unloaded and cleared through customs.
We checked it in as checked baggage for faster transit. The airline's rules don't allow sending a package without a passenger, which is where you come in.
Flying first class or business class is a straightforward way to do it if you shell out a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay four times the normal fare for business class and eleven times the normal fare for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats between points A and B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay large sums for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic strife.
In 1994, this conflict led to the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but the country is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova were restored.
In Moldova, Orthodox Christianity is the main religion.
With approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, İzmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The former city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and busy commercial hub, situated in a vast bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are marble statues depicting interesting pigeons above some of the graves.
It's worth taking a half-hour stroll in the captivating little village.
To the north, in an easily accessible location, lies Sintra, a romantic and stunning town that became famous to foreigners after Lord Byron's notes on the town's splendors.
Scotturb bus number 403 frequently departs for Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima, a world-renowned site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave of inestimable value to a portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time there, and there are many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, whether they were Jewish or not.
Please treat this space with the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by drawing graffiti or scratching the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understands it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signage is only in Catalan, as it is the first official language according to the law.
Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced in multiple languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, via an automated system.
Parisians are known as egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
While often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave as well as we can: like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make things significantly easier for us.
The Parisians' brusque behavior quickly disappears if you observe a few basic courtesies.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is a very wooded area, mostly consisting of beech, spruce, and coniferous trees, and a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly wide variety of plant communities due to its microclimatic range, differing soil types, and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely diverse range of animal and bird species.
A rare fauna can be found here, including the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, as well as many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in a vibrant color, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Following this same principle, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the garments are not washed after every user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like other Mediterranean regions, mainly uses bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summertime, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and whatever seasonings are available, be it cheese, tuna, or anything.
All nouns, besides the Sie (you) words, are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and their objects.
It is claimed that it makes reading easier, although writing becomes somewhat more complicated, as one has to figure out whether a verb or adjective is being used in its nominalized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
Furthermore, attention must be paid to the different pronunciations of the single r and the double rr: caro means expensive, while carro means cart.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and mostly regular.
Consequently, by reading this grammar primer, we can learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the expressions.
It goes without saying that someone who knows a Romance language will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
Despite this, people who know a little Spanish often hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now outdated and are becoming museums or educational sites.
In their heyday, light pollution wasn't such a significant problem, so they were mostly located in cities or university areas, in more easily accessible places than their modern counterparts.
Most modern research telescopes are massive instruments located in isolated areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were the most beloved flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the emperor for himself and the aristocratic members of the imperial court.
Plants are most beautiful in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If they catch you collecting "patterns" in a decoratively arranged garden, they will throw you out without question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, easy to navigate, and where you can get almost everything you need after arrival.
However, since the area slightly north of the equator belongs to the "very hot zone," one must reckon with both the heat (always) and the strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs—Abraham, Isaac, Jacob—and their wives.
Check whether the bus you want to take actually goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for a holiday.
For example, visiting the Loire Valley châteaux or the Rhine Valley, or taking a river cruise on the Danube touching on interesting cities, or perhaps boating along the Erie Canal.
Furthermore, they also designate popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, when the birth of Jesus is celebrated.
Many traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by non-religious members of Christian countries, as well as by non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition where people spend Easter night awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are also Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is likely that it is a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Holy Saturday night, and congregations often erupt in celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, so the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans, numerous mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos Islands, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for most of the day.
Since the regions are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you can also enjoy stargazing.
Japanese work culture is more formal and hierarchical than Westerners may be used to.
The suit is a common business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Workplace harmony plays a crucial role, therefore it's important to emphasize group efforts instead of highlighting individual achievements.
Employees must seek their superiors' approval before making any decisions, and they are expected to carry out their superiors' instructions without question.
