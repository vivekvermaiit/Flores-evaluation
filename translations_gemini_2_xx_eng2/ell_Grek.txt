This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as their color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that this animal's wings were brown on top with a light or carrot color on the bottom.
The finding also provides information about the evolution of plumage in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a fully developed rachis, but do possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development compared to the other characteristics.
The structure of the wings suggests they weren't used for flight but for thermoregulation or display. Scientists claim that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not chick down.
The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen indicates adult plumage rather than that of a hatchling.

The part of the project that was completed was mainly theoretical, however, the program was designed to represent observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
What the team anticipated would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, creating tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a pull on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory posits that the majority of the dark matter found in a galaxy is located around the galaxy, forming a kind of halo, and consists of many small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have always been a low-tech affair: voters isolate themselves in a voting booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper bearing the name of their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the employees verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The process is codified with great strictness by the electoral law of France.
Since 1988, voters must be visible in order to allow voters and witnesses to certify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting process and that no additional envelopes are added beyond those legally counted and those of legitimate voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the late afternoon, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his hand and jaw, while Christopher Schneider ended up needing reconstructive surgery on his face.
Yuka's gun misfired, as it was pointed at a man's head. Schneider suffers constant pain, blindness in one eye, loss of part of his skull, and facial reconstruction with titanium.
Schneider testified via live link from a US Air Force base in his home country.
Besides Wednesday's event, Karpanedo competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first event was the Slalom, where she earned a "Did Not Finish" on her first run. 36 of the 116 competitors received the same result in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting ski category with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's sit-ski category were unable to complete their runs, while 45 out of 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are Baba Kantzar, Bota Kantzar, Rabro Kantzar, Gaza Kantzar, and Vishnu Kantzar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Sekhar Solanki stated that the accused were presented in court with their faces covered.
Although 3 people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He then went to an Addenbrooke's clinic in Cambridge.
Adekoia has since been accused by the High Court of Edinburgh of murdering her son.
He is in custody facing charges and a pending trial, but any eyewitness testimony may have been tainted as her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but justice in Scotland operates differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing photographs is potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee states that "journalists appear to be walking a tightrope if they publish photographs etc. of suspects."
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has informed journalists that there will be no further comment at least until charges are filed.
According to leaked information, the document will refer to the border dispute desired by Palestine, based on the borders prior to the Middle Eastern war fought in 1967.
According to reports, among the other issues covered were the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy site for both states, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow this kind of presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control trial would be under close supervision by the forest rangers, as the trial would be monitored and its effectiveness judged.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), specialist volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters' Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Director General for Conservation and Heritage of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four marksmen selected for the initial hunting operation received thorough safety briefings and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the early resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martel's response to the widespread anti-government demonstrations that began in October.
Some violent protests occurred due to the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Based on official reports, there were approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions resulting in high temperatures, starting six fires and leaving four people with minor burn injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Mariana Islands' Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management stated that there were no reports of damage to their territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino, a former police officer, took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of his country.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least 6 deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six of the hostages, along with the children and the elderly, were released early; so were the photographers who came from the Philippines.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
She qualified and became a gynecologist, starting work in 1959 at the Auckland State Women's Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liggins, in his spare time, began researching premature birth.
According to his research, if a hormone were given, the embryonic lung would mature.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday located two flight data recorders of the "black box" type.
Her fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme winner. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Unique just like she was. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as strange as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people who participated in the poll before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34% of those who participated in the poll agreed with this idea because they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding the two extremes of the poll, 29% of all respondents believe that Australia should become a republic without a monarchy as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic without a monarchy.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relay swimming events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his discomfort, his fitness is in doubt.
He couldn't get the medication he needed for the pain because it's prohibited by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number found to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water transport to Earth, as well as organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, became governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration claims that the Next Generation Air Transportation System would allow aircraft to conduct shorter routes, save gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
The technology it uses is satellite-based – as opposed to older radar-based terrestrial technology – to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no further transport running, and underground trains will not be stopping at Wembley. Car parks and park and ride facilities are unavailable at the ground.
Fears about the lack of transportation are raising the possibility that the match will have to be held behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study published in Science on Thursday discussed the existence of a new type of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in as little as two generations, even though the process was believed to have taken much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch of the genus Geospiza fortis and the migratory finch of the genus Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be sculpted into all shapes. It can be formed into shapes of minimal size.
It can be sculpted into fine wire, and then bent and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can become very thin and adhere to other metals. It can become so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in handmade book images called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical substance is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being examined.
Hydrogen ions are protons that no longer have their electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Combine the two dry powders and then, with clean, wet hands, press them together to form a ball.
The moisture on your palms will react with the outer shells, creating a strange sensation and forming something like a peel.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Also, in Greece, ruins of drainage systems have been found in the residences of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets also appeared in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets in Rome were often part of public baths, where everyone, regardless of gender, formed a mixed crowd.
When you call someone who is very far away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back to Earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Experts have space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere creates distortions in light and our visibility.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is required to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The contribution of the wheel to the world is amazing. The most important thing of all is the simpler and faster movement.
Thanks to him, we have trains, cars, and many other transportation machines.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, there are many kitten predators (including, among others, domestic cats that are allowed to roam free) that hunt the vast numbers of insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the idea of position, a specific role that each cat has, which prevents competition between them.
Lions are the most social of the cat family, as they live in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three adult males that are related to each other along with up to thirty females with their young.
Females usually have a close connection to each other, as they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave largely like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger, as a complete athlete, can climb (at a not very good level), swim, make huge leaps, and exert five times more force than a strong man to lift something.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the sonorous roar of a lion, but is more like a phrase of angry, shouted words.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to feed on (to hunt) by using their sense of smell, sniffing the ground to see where they are.
They see very well in the dark through night vision and move silently. Ocelots hunt their prey through their adaptation to their environment and then suddenly attacking their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often encounter a different environment than before.
This new environment features new resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was required in the past.
The indigenous people haven't changed at all; the same adjustments need to be made as in the past.
As time passes, and the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the similarity to the rest of the population increasingly diminishes.
At some point, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., release with their breath).
Plants create their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made from plants. The food we eat is mostly plants. Without plants, animal survival would be impossible.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so nothing frightened it except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws boasted over 70 razor-sharp teeth, coupled with an additional row of teeth on the roof of his mouth, suggesting there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
It would attack anything that entered the water. Even the gigantic dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, would be no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had various strange or unusual festive dishes, including the following: wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference lies in the fact that the poor and women ate their food sitting on chairs, while wealthy men preferred to eat at banquets where they could relax on their side while dining.
Meals in ancient Rome could not have contained foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, there was no corn, tomato, potato, or cocoa, while no ancient Roman had ever eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the god's dwelling.
The people would dedicate sacrifices to the deities, and the priesthood would attempt to fulfill the deities' wishes by organizing mysteries and celebrations.
In every temple there is an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary which only priests have access to.
Sometimes specific turrets were built in a pyramidal shape called ziggurats, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower constituted a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the roof was not so important.
The Jewish family spent most of their life in the countryside.
The women were cooking in the courtyard, while the shops were open stalls facing the street. Stone was used as a building material.
The land of Canaan did not have large forested areas, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse saga recounts that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, as he sailed west, found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, despite its discovery, the Inuit were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Nordic," the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed greatly.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might believe that there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." This is written upside down, on the bottom.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the beginning, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the note might have simply been added as a label.
The Normandy landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the South remained unfree.
It was governed by the Vichy Government. This consisted of Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were collaborating with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; this raid was called Operation "Dragoon."
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France, and Germany was next.
Culture is a unique tradition shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization (πολιτισμός) comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning civil (πολιτικός), which is related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and this in fact describes in some way the size of the society.
City-states are the ancestors of states. A cultural culture implies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, in a continuous cultural imprint and an exquisite dissemination.
Often, smaller civilizations are lost without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government - with Congress being the sole component - based on the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, which were uncooperative, to enforce all laws.
Furthermore, he had no jurisdiction to override the legislation concerning taxation and duties between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, but the states took the government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The national football teams of Italy and Germany are the second most successful teams worldwide, and in fact, they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern countries, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic Games events.
In Japan, there are almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island nation on the planet!
Due to its cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
The origin of Taiwan is lost in the past, in the 15th century, when passing European sailors designated the island as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and initiated a transformation in the practices by which indigenous grains were produced, employing Chinese laborers in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the west and north of Taiwan, which they made an administrative prefecture of their empire in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty then concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby Taiwan passed into Japanese hands until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been rebuilt from scratch in order to give tourists a better idea of what their original appearance was like.
30% of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format is 35 mm worldwide, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, it has inherited its aspect ratio from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm film format is actually 36mm wide, which is confusing, and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this arrangement (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format category, for example) are equal to or closely approximate these image ratios.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while also maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It states that the most effective point for the main subject is located at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which by now possessed wealth and power, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has forged unbreakable bonds between European states, despite any differences in language and customs.
His ubiquitous power influenced everyone, from kings to common mortals.
One of the core beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate the suffering of the poor and those in need, and church funds are collected specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether the doctrine was being properly implemented.
Great Britain began to blockade Germany by sea immediately after the start of the attacks.
The strategy proved effective, as cuts were made to vital military and civilian supplies, even though said blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom laid mines in international waters to impede the movement of ships in all parts of the sea, even threatening neutral ships.
Since there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected the same for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was peace and isolation.
The states, having seen the horror and atrocities of war during World War I, wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a job at the Edison company.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (a manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing each distinct period of time. Each stage of China or each family in power constituted a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was that of the Three Kingdoms, which prevailed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those times, a fierce war raged between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The social and political consequences are many, and among them are the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to democracy, patriotism, and the belief that the country does not belong to a single ruler, but to all the people.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, professions were accessible to all men seeking work, giving the most ambitious and successful the opportunity to succeed.
The same was true for the army, as conscription was now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed individuals from the working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, having survived through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave is far from the world as it is located on the edge of a hill north of Mecca.
In reality, it's not at all easy for someone to find it, even if they know of its existence. As soon as you enter the cave, you are in complete isolation.
Nothing is visible beyond the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very few things of this world are visible or can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, which was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many large, pyramid-shaped structures that were constructed in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, has various pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), some small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, as well as the smaller tombs and temples, were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The sign indicating that the bow should move upwards looks like a V, and the sign indicating the downward movement resembles a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Playing up-bow means you should start at the tip, pushing the bow, and playing down-bow means you should start at the frog (that is, the point where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
Playing with an up bow produces a softer sound, while playing with a down bow is stronger and more powerful.
You are free to add your own markings, but keep in mind that the existing ones serve a musical function, so they often need to be considered.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the eleven-year-old Marie Thérèse and the four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, who were terrified, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to throw open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a person from the mob began to wave the head of a member of the royal guard, who had been killed at Versailles, before the eyes of the terrified queen.
The costs of the United States' imperialist war to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds was promoted on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profits which resulted from the long-term exploitation of the people of the Philippines were destined to become the core profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must grasp the context that led to the order's creation.
The era in which these events occurred is often referred to as the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, ranging from the promotion or imposition of technology to the strict interpretation that the future of humanity is governed by an underlying logic directly linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two central ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a course largely removed from cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn exerts "influence" on societies of an inherent nature, rather than societies adapted to the present.
For example, someone might argue that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national-scale road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed with the aim of reducing the cost of car ownership.
The regime of mass ownership also leads to higher rates of traffic accidents, which in turn lead to new methods in healthcare for the restoration of bodily injuries.
Romanticism possessed a significant element of cultural determinism, stemming from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and cultural elements arose in connection with this geography, which, being in harmony with the society's location, were better than laws that were arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is considered a source of style in the modern era, so too was Constantinople the corresponding European source during feudalism.
His reputation as the epicenter of abundance began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its prestige declined in the twelfth century, mainly due to the crusaders who brought back materials such as silk and spices, which had a higher value than the products of the markets of Byzantium.
That was when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as in the 14th century.
In the beginning, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Nevertheless, the slow communication channels entailed delays of 25 to 30 years in artistic style in the West.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the era, which came about as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to fasten their clothes with buttons.
Subsistence agriculture is farming that takes place to produce enough food only to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic system using saved seeds sourced from the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Traditionally, the majority of farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with similar views, who feel marginalized by social norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are divided based on criteria such as the member's age, origin, social class, location, and/or racial distinction.
The characteristics of a subculture that make it distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
To signal their belonging, members of a subculture often adopt a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes various fashions, particular behaviors, and slang.
The primary technique for understanding the meaning of socialization is to rely on the rare unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or maltreatment, did not interact with adults during their lives.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been isolated by people, usually their own parents. In some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to rejection by their parents because of a severe mental or physical disability of the child.
Feral children are likely to have experienced severe abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are speculated to have lived alone in the wild.
A feral child, having been raised entirely by animals without any contact with humans, exhibits behaviors (within natural limits) that almost perfectly resemble those of the specific animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, assistive technologies take it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather more of a helping hand to people undergoing a new learning experience, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
There are virtual and real scaffolds, in other words, the teacher constitutes a form of scaffolding, but the same applies to the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual aids are incorporated into the software and are designed to ask questions, prompt, and explain processes that students might otherwise find very difficult to handle.
Children are placed in the care of foster parents for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse, even to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment without care, love, and education, yet it happens.
We understand the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
The foster care system we have is considered to provide safe homes, caring individuals who offer care, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that the child was not receiving in the home from which they were removed.
The internet incorporates elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet result in the existence of additional dimensions regarding the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motivations for someone to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as aspects of impetus by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when researching audience reactions to websites.
Videotaping has helped with significant findings in understanding microexpressions, that is, our expressions that last infinitesimally briefly.
Specifically, it is said that one can perceive if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his essay titled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks mentions that individuals who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to discern sincerity with accuracy.
It is further considered that these abilities in how human behavior is understood are present in animals such as domestic dogs.
A twentieth-century study showed that there are two forms of genetic variation, latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and mixing redistribute diversity between the two sides in each family.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, their failure in this specific instance had serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be proteins gleaned from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primary mammals like us to assimilate unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also an important source of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking all factors into account, it doesn't surprise us that our ancestors addressed the "protein issue" in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process where you wake up consciously during the normal interval of your sleep and go back to sleep after a while (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so you can regain your senses without fully waking up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so you have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties) before bed, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The less the pressure, the better the vital force that is present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and pleasure.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only things standing as obstacles to this goal are the tension and negativity within each of us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism, in principle, is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces it all.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightening) awakens due to movements, breathing practices, mantra, and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, conflicts at the level of systems, processes, and culture led the two countries to a rupture.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and would feature proxy wars, with battles taking place in locations from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other areas.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup in the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans ceased to be beneficial virtually overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belorussian Front and the Ukrainian Front, after invading the eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large portions of the population and goods across the ocean.
The task of sailors since ancient times has been to ensure that your country can transport its own people and goods, while simultaneously preventing your enemy from transporting theirs and their goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans would most likely have been able to conquer Britain as they did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes begin to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often watched by goatherds who were usually children or adolescents, counterparts to the more widely known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Wooden railways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the railroads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling wagons to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Wooden rail ties appeared quite early and were intended to hold the railroad rails in place. Gradually, however, it became apparent that the rails would be much more functional with an iron support on top.
Something like that was a common method, but iron caused more damage to the wheels of the wagons than wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first railway lines consisting exclusively of iron made their appearance.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans started walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as is customary.
Evidence of bipedal movement has been found in australopithecine fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We have the opportunity to live a more sustainable life, to become part of the environmental movement, and perhaps to act activistically in order to somehow limit the problems of the future.
It's like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want a temporary fix, we will need to discover the source of the issues and neutralize them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a great deal due to humanity's scientific and technological achievements, and that the problems have grown due to overpopulation and a wasteful lifestyle.
Following its approval by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten note signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were published, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8th in the outdoor area of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that we know still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many paleontologists nowadays believe that a type of dinosaur survived to this day. They are referring to birds.
Many do not consider them dinosaurs because they possess feathers and the ability to fly.
However, many things about birds make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs with claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Computers are now based on the management of information encoded with a binary system.
To use computer terminology, a binary number can only take one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The most reliable sign that someone has been poisoned internally is an open bottle of medication or some toxic household chemical substance in the area.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "coreos" is officially used by etymologists for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancients' familiarity with bedbugs, which were insects that easily adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or shelter of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological condition among younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
Two partners might decide that raising an infant is not in their best interest or the best interest of the child they have.
These couples can create an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method essentially guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation doesn't exist in isolation; specifically, an experiment is a test conducted to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, while questioning and observation also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, specifically, on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's positions on scientific matters, including psychology, enjoyed acceptance.
As Greek intellectuality lost ground, the West became detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that rhythms noted in physiology and behavior often depend on the existence of endogenous cycles, as well as their production which is carried out through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that perpetually continue their cyclical function even when they have no external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase took phages, or microbes, in order to inject their genetic material into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can bring about a wide variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, how important the affected region of the genetic material is, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by offspring, as mutations in other cells may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who seek natural landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the area's wild flora and fauna.
Examples of activities in a given location include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information related to the ecosystem.
For example, some visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their workplaces and meet others whose work destination is the place from which the first group just left.
In dynamic shuttle transportation, everyone is connected to each other in some way and supports a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Today, science shows that this vast carbon economy has thrown the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported the evolution of the human species for the past two million years.
Every individual participates in society and uses some form of transportation system. And almost everyone expresses complaints about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard to the same degree.
Why do transportation systems elicit such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental to blame?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the movement of specific drivers and cars between two locations and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is not easy, as it is impossible to predict driver behavior with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a range of reasonable consistency; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical consistency and can be mathematically represented approximately.
To best represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assisted in the preparation, design, and operations of road network facilities.
The first animals to take flight were insects. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body backwards.
This provides them with a greater variety of small hiding places from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many years ago, Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought the opposite, namely that the Solar System revolved around the Earth and the Sun (even around other stars).
It seems logical, since the Earth doesn't seem like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river by volume on the planet. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching 6 miles.
20% of the water discharged by the Earth's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the pyramids of Giza in size and technical perfection of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were impressed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The inhabitants of Vatican City number approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world, and the one with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official announcements.
The Italian language is also used in everyday life by most people working for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of these can be found in nature in raw form and their extraction with primitive tools is relatively easy.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is created by the mixing of one or more of the four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
It mainly resembled the four states of matter (in this order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it still assumed they transform into new substances in order to form this presence.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many chemical elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals as well, like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of very small particles, atoms.
The size of atoms is so extremely small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil, when it appeared, became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerge, the position and usefulness of the pencil has been degraded.
People now write messages on computer screens, never needing to pick up a scratch awl.
One might wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer appears.
A fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. By splitting the nucleus again, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and this leads them to decay even under little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There might be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. Lava could more easily reach the surface that way.
Content theories focus on discovering what resonates with people or what attracts them.
These theories argue that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
These theories study what makes certain people want what they want, and what exists in their environment that will lead them to do or not do specific things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Broadly speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. One extreme of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct evaluations, delegate responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one can be transformed into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and appropriate it for themselves.
At the end of the day, the one ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure is the captain.
This behavior often leads to a breakdown in relations between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are created with the same principles of team effectiveness as conventional teams, however, there are slight differences.
The virtual team members often act as a link to their immediate physical team.
Often, they are more autonomous than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be accepted by their local management.
The existence of an "invisible group" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is yet another unique element of a virtual team.
Everyone is introduced to the "invisible team" in charge of management. This team defines the specifications for all participants.
Why would an organization want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing organizational learning capabilities? One of the goals for practically implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and intelligence are fostered when all available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization.
As a result, the process by which an organization collaborates to overcome an obstacle can lead to new innovative processes that benefit customer service.
In order for an organization to be innovative, management must create an environment of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel's (2006) explanation of the continuous learning approach describes it as a method used to help organizations increase their performance level.
Neurobiological data offer physical evidence for a theoretical study of cognition. Therefore, they limit the breadth of research, making it more clear.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is helpful for researchers and their studies.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, trauma, and tumors affect behavior and may cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that humans have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence largely evokes science fiction, it is, nevertheless, a significant branch of computer science that deals with the adaptation of behavior, learning, and intelligence in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence involves building machines with the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include auditing, programming, answering customer diagnoses and queries, as well as handwriting recognition, speech recognition, and facial recognition.
These now constitute distinct principles, which focus on providing solutions to real, everyday problems.
Nowadays, AI systems often operate in the fields of finance, healthcare, engineering, and armed forces, and are even embedded in various home computer software applications and cyberspace games.
Field trips are an important element of every class. Very often a teacher would like to take their students to places where access by bus, however, is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours. Students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while in their classroom.
Essentially, participating in a trip is also a significant opportunity to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year it is updated, but the old versions are kept online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also contribute to improving a student's writing skills. While students' experience with blogs often begins with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
As students often constitute the most critical audience, the blogger is beginning to do his best to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, participation in blogs "forces students to become more understanding of the world around them." The need to maintain public interest inspires students to become clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Managing a website is a technique that promotes teamwork and encourages students to learn things beyond what they classically learn at school in the morning.
The correct use of blogs "can encourage students to use more analytical and critical thinking, as through active response to online material, students can define their positions within the context of other people's texts, as well as express their own perceptions on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting, bilingual capital of Canada, featuring a wide array of galleries and museums that showcase both old and modern Canada.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and many more characterize Ontario as the quintessence of the Canadian character as perceived by foreigners.
Large areas in the far northern part are sparsely populated, while some are almost uninhabited wilderness zones.
For a population comparison that surprises many: The number of African Americans living in the US is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and constitutes a continent in itself when it comes to its wildlife species.
Almost all of the small islands are independent or of French origin, and are renowned for providing luxurious marine retreats.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and it spread extensively as far as the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the explorer Vasco da Gama, who came from Portugal, discovered the route that circumnavigates the Cape and leads from Europe to India.
The area is bordered to the north by the Sahel, while the Atlantic Ocean surrounds it on the south and west sides.
Women: It is recommended that every woman traveling declare herself married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that customs that differ in culture can escalate to actions that would be considered harassment, and it's not uncommon for men to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Be unwavering when rejecting a man, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that's no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and became a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, who gave it the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and gave it the name Dar al-Baida, while the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is among the places that offer the least interesting shopping in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but it's all touristy.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo with high tourist traffic in the eastern end near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma suffered devastation due to the Nyiragongo volcano, whose lava covered almost all the city's roads, especially the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be considered carefully in order to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking and observation programs in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The typical price (locally) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has acquired the metaphorical meaning of an exotic, faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage monuments in danger, because it is threatened by desert sand.
This is one of the most important stops during Henry Louis Gates' program on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) about the Wonders of the African World.
The city differs completely from the other cities in the country, as it mainly possesses an Arabic air, and not an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-eastern part of South Africa and is located on the border line of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while its southern border is considered to be the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different areas of ecological interest, each supporting different species of wildlife.
It is one of the most remarkable sights in South Africa and is referred to as the emblem of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation entrance fees for the park.
It might be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either selected parks in South Africa or all of its national parks.
Hong Kong Island is also the name of the Hong Kong territory and is a major attraction for many visitors.
The splendor of the buildings that shape Hong Kong's urban panorama has been likened to a glittering bar graph accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go across to the Kowloon waterfront.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island has for the most part been concentrated in high density on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonialists occupied, and therefore, if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The section of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they include some of the last remnants of the imposing jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sunderban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by water/marsh zones.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 7:30.
Because intercity buses are usually full, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster-type buses, which are characterized by their comfort and durability.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two corridors with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the lands that are today known as eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the conflict between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The age of colonization, which lasted three centuries, began with the Spanish.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in the last month of the year at the water polo pools of Las Cañitas.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news regarding tournaments and ticket sale locations for water polo matches, check the Argentine Water Polo Federation.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the islands' only bank, which is located in Stanley across from the F.I.K. West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are usually accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it has summer when the northern hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
The cold in winter is deceptive: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to create the feeling that it is colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human presence, their wild nature remains wild, so we must not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
However calm bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals may seem, they can still attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain appropriate distances. These animals are large, wild, and can become dangerous, so give them space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking foods with strong odors and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850, and since 1959 it has been the official capital of Samoa.
In the harbor, a famous naval standoff had taken place in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to depart from it.
All ships were sunk except for a British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city culminated in the assassination of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland has two harbors. The most popular ones are located in this area.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour ward) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches suitable for safe swimming, and most even have shade from pōhutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with families and have a good variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is called "Number One" and it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
A wide variety of French wines are available for tasting, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be a better choice.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
In Australia, the concept of a flat white coffee is foreign. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino is topped with cream instead of foam, and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but amazing.
Throughout the year, many trips take place on the reef, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From 1770, box jellyfish have been appearing near beaches and river mouths from October to April. Occasionally, they can be spotted at different times of the year.
Sharks do exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of them and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not inhabit the sea; their primary natural environment is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking earlier ensures travelers that they will have accommodation to stay in when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation like camping through an agent.
Travel agents commonly offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer arrangements, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
Your application can be put on hold if you need time to reconsider the offer or gather other travel documents (e.g., a visa).
However, any modifications or requests should be referred to the travel agent first, and not sent directly to the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the majority of those attending music festivals decide to camp there, and most consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should start early to find a campsite near the music.
Please remember that while the music may end at the main stages, there may be parts of the festival where music continues late into the night.
Some festivals provide special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as the ship makes terrible noises when passing through ice, especially for those who are most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on board the ship are not required to have a visa (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that visitors spend. Windows and clocks are absent, while exits are difficult to find.
Often there are special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers in good spirits and within the business premises.
Free alcoholic beverages are offered in various areas. However, intoxication affects judgment, and a good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to travel by road at high altitude or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and very low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is not enough friction, making driving difficult compared to bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, it can snow so much that it can trap you in a very short amount of time.
Visibility may also be limited during snowfall, humidity, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, where traffic continues mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist draw in Africa and an attraction for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used to refer to a land journey with the purpose of visiting the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars, and basic equipment will help with good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk" or "hiking safari") consists of hiking for either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, having previously hosted them in 1964.
If you arranged how you would fly and where you would stay for 2020 before it was announced that they would be postponed, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies are not being extended to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, while the price of standard tickets is around 7,000 yen.
Ironing can help in drying wet clothes. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or you don't care about wearing ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer in that case, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are various ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, a minute of boiling water is enough, but in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider the possibility of buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter infectious animals that they are not used to encountering in their home country.
Parasites destroy food, cause irritations, or, in the worst cases, trigger allergic reactions, carry poison, and transmit infections.
Contagious diseases or wild animals that have the ability to strike or brutally kill people are not often classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping offers the opportunity to purchase goods, in specific locations, without the burden of customs duties and excise taxes.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like spirits and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is very dangerous to drive on along the Buffalo-Pittsburg highway because it crosses many lonely rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, keep your eyes open: roads with steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is even more important to adhere to them strictly.
However, strangely enough, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than along other sections of the trail, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite high quality, while in Bavaria one can find them in abundance and variety, comparable to those of its southern neighboring country, Austria.
Fruit desserts usually include apples, which are used to make sweets all year round, and cherries and plums, which appear in the summer.
A large number of German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The well-known cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but delicious pastries, try these called Berliners, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry consists of herbs and spices, and is served with foods of animal or plant origin.
You can find curry "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is mainly added to curries. In southern and other coastal parts of India, coconut milk is mainly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an all-encompassing term that includes a wide variety of cuisines from regions across the country.
However, if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to denote food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now found throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a menu of mildly spiced dishes, with key flavors favored by Javanese people such as peanuts, chili, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are used as a support for the rider's lower limbs and are held on the right and left sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, however, they may pose safety challenges due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If someone riding a horse falls off but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them down the road as it runs. To prevent this from happening, some safety precautions are taken.
Initially, most riders have special shoes that have heels and a soft, relatively small sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English ones, feature safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by the rider during a fall.
Cochamó Valley - A major climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America with a variety of large walls and granite boulders.
The mountaintops have amazing views from the hills. Climbers from all over the world create new routes along the endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding down sloping terrain covered in snow with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a significant travel activity with many enthusiasts, often called ski bums, planning entire vacations to ski in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depict skiers dating back to 5,000 BC!
We find downhill skiing as a sport even in the 17th century, while in 1861, the first recreational ski club was founded in Australia by some Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or backcountry skiing.
It is related to alpine skiing and alpinism, but usually does not include them, as the latter take place on steep terrain and require much tougher skis and boots.
Think of ski touring as similar to covering distance by hiking.
Under ideal conditions, you'll be able to cover relatively greater distances than walking - but you will very rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on specially prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, visiting many countries during travel would require visa applications and multiple passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, could be said to function as a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay within this zone, you are generally allowed to cross borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen area member states, saving you time, money, and bureaucratic procedures.
There is no universal definition by which a manufactured product is classified as an antique. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, as the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade items can be considered antiques, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important occupation for the Sami, while the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who are involved in other professions.
Even traditionally, of course, not all Sami participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but some lived by fishing, hunting, and other means, using reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern commerce. Tourism is a significant source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Despite its widespread use, especially among people who are not Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccuracies about the Roma.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the guidelines of other governments besides your own, although their guidelines are designed for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different conditions than Europeans or Arabs.
The instructions are only an overview of domestic political events.
The views presented are often concise, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term encompassing any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather phenomena can occur in all parts of the earth, and there are various categories based on geographical, topographical, or atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, torrential rain, and fires are forms and consequences of severe weather, as are storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Local and seasonal adverse weather phenomena include heavy snowfalls, blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather that may be affecting their area, as it may impact their travel plans.
Those planning travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Awareness Training" will likely bring up the address of a local company.
A course would normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, often due to practical exercises.
A course will usually last 2-5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with desert survival are common, however publications dealing with the war zone are few.
Those who travel and plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery in another country should ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without specifying gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The appetite of foreign governments to respect these specific documents also changes significantly.
Security screenings at checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in a pre-operative state cannot expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are return flows from waves breaking on the beach, often near a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, return flows concentrate in deeper sections where strong, deep-water currents may develop.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
Once you are out of the current, swimming to shore will be no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a location where you haven't been trapped before, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it might be preferable to wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock begins before culture shock (the honeymoon phase shrinks), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapt easily to a new culture sometimes face difficulties readjusting to their native culture.
When you return to your country after having lived abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits that belonged to your country's culture.
When you first went abroad, it's likely that people showed patience and understanding, as they know that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
Many may not foresee the patience and understanding needed by travelers to return home.
One of the events taking place in the area that is of great interest to children is the sound and light show at the pyramid.
See the pyramids at night in peace before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and merchants. The story of sound and light seems just like a fairytale.
The Sphinx is the backdrop, but also the narrator, of a great story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are subject to territorial claims by several states and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which also has the Villa Las Estrellas settlement.
Others include Livingston and Deception Islands, where the flooded crater of a volcano that is still active provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, which is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula join the plateau at this point, and then reappear to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth mountain range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest elevation being the summit of Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In isolated areas where there is no phone signal, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone does not replace a mobile phone in general, because you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is frequently used in navigation, including recreational boats, as well as for missions that utilize remote data and have voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
A choice that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It has particular appeal to people who have finished school, as it allows them to take a year off before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In some cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can increase your chances of progressing to higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees are usually required for enrollment in such educational programs.
Finland is an ideal place for boat trips. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," you will also find thousands of islands, both on the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
The boat won't necessarily be useful to you in the archipelago and the lakes.
While the archipelago and the larger lakes are indeed big enough for any pleasure craft, smaller boats or even kayaks provide an alternative experience.
Boating is a national pastime for Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This can be compared to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but generally it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Almost all upscale cruises in the Baltic include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a few full days while returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
If you disembark in the city only through excursions organized by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their advertising brochures. As seen on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be considered a very frightening experience by people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something you should be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and dislikes about other things that many people have.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help them overcome a phobia based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are paid handsomely for the fast delivery of goods. Quite often, time is a significant factor when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
Larger companies have their own airplanes for some routes, but problems arise regarding other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent goods via air freight, on some flights it might take days after unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster would be to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where your role begins.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay a bunch of money for the privileged seat (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this comes at a cost: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core category of passengers who are willing to spend a lot of money for the privilege of a fast and comfortable journey to their destination, and they charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, however, Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic democratic state that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not officially recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have resumed, despite the fact that political negotiations have failed.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with almost 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a key meeting point for transportation.

The Scotturb bus 403 frequently runs to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also visit in the north the famous Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (church), a site of the world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, which is of utmost importance to many people worldwide.
There are many men and women alive who survived there, and many whose loved ones were killed or worked and died there, whether Jewish or not.
Please show the place the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not vandalize the area by painting or carving graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half choose to speak Catalan, most understand the language, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
Nevertheless, most signs are written only in Catalan, as it has been established by law as the primary official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is used extensively in public transport and other services.
Typical announcements on the underground railway are made only in Catalan, but non-standard disruptions are announced by an automated machine that has a range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The residents of Paris are famous for their self-centeredness, rudeness, and arrogance.
Even though it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to put on your best behavior, as if you were someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). It will make your interactions much easier.
The Parisians' abruptness will quickly disappear if you show basic politeness.
In the Plitvice Lakes National Park, there is a lush green forest with beech, spruce, and fir trees, while the flora is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It exhibits remarkable diversity in terms of plant communities due to the various microclimates, soil diversity, and different altitudes.
The place has a significant variety of animal and bird species.
Endangered animals, such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie, are found in this area, as well as various common animals.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear a skirt that covers the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries have long skirts available for women who have come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
In the same way, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can also borrow this from the stock at the entrance, but this particular garment is not washed after every use, and therefore you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. It's a men's size!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like the cuisines of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and various accompaniments like cheese, tuna, etc.
The first letter of all nouns, as well as the word Sie (you), is always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is how verbal forms are distinguished from objects based on a rule.
One could argue that it makes reading easier, even though the writing is relatively complex due to the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
Italian pronunciation has a relative ease, as the majority of words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The key letters that require your attention are 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows.
Besides that, remember to pronounce the single 'r' and double 'rr' differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly smooth grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book would help you enrich your knowledge of Persian grammar as well as better understand various expressions.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those with a limited knowledge of Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that one doesn't need to study it separately.
Today, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and preserved as museums or educational spaces.
Since light pollution was not the problem it is today during their prime, they are often located in cities or on university campuses, and access to them is easier than to those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large installations in isolated locations with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept has its origins in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of the season.
The first cherry blossom festivals held in Japan were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other nobles belonging to his court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so don't give in to temptation and remove a specimen.
If, also, during your visit to a formally arranged garden, you collect "samples," you are going to be kicked out without argument.
Singapore is generally a very safe and easy to navigate place, and you can acquire almost anything you need upon arrival.
However, in "high tropical climates," slightly north of the equator, you will need to contend with both the heat (always) and the intense sun (more rarely, under a clear sky).
There are still some buses heading north in Hebron, the classic burial ground of the Old Testament Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take passes through Hebron, and not just the neighboring Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.

There is a tradition according to which you stay awake on Easter night in some open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are explanations from Christian theology for this tradition, but it may very well be a pre-Christian ritual for spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold the Resurrection service on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with the congregation bursting into celebration precisely at midnight, chanting the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on the islands came here either swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to travel there, making the giant tortoise the first herbivore in the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have appeared, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to observe the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
The fact that the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore there isn't a problem with light pollution, gives you the opportunity to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work ethic is more hierarchical and formal compared to what Westerners are used to.
Suits are typical professional attire, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is of vital importance, as emphasis is placed on teamwork rather than rewarding individual achievements.
Employees often need their supervisors' approval for every decision and must obey their superiors' instructions without objection.
