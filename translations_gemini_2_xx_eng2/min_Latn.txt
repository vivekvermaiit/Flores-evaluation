While one experimental vaccine appears to reduce deaths from Ebola, to date, there is no proven cure to treat existing infections.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies showed that its benefit was less than hoped for in preventing people from dying.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp functioned as the control, meaning the scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments against it.
USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee’s letter and recognizes the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the needs of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, might be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization, rather than being decertified.
U.S. sports are supporting independent investigations that can address how the abuse perpetrated with such confidence by the survivor-named Larry Nassar went undetected for so long and encompasses all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal — to make the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.

This not only informs that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widespread theory, but also provides details that are generally not found in fossils, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is reddish-brown on the upper part and pale or reddish-yellow on the lower part.
This discovery adds to our understanding of feather evolution and bird-like creatures.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but did possess other feather-like characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers conclude that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development from these other traits.
The feather structure indicates that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows that this dinosaur's feathers are those of a large dinosaur, not chick-like feathers.
The researchers showed that, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample indicates that this dinosaur's feathers are those of a large dinosaur, not feathers like a chick.

Those people have proven that the Sun operates with the same basic principles as other stars: Finding the work of all stars in a system that is rejected by its luminosity, rotation, and no other source.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is to magnetic reversals.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but this program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effects sought by the team will be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of that galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just like the moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth, creating tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that a large portion of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a halo around the galaxy, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he mentioned that this new variant is "very disturbing and worrying due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may contract germs in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two who contracted them were hospital health workers.
Within one year, an infected person can transmit the disease to 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the overall group of tuberculosis sufferers appears to be still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images indicate that the temperature difference between day and night suggests it might be a cave.
At midday the place is cooler than its surroundings, but at night it is warmer.
"This thermal behavior isn't as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that this is a deep hole in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, slip a pre-printed ballot with their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officers verified the voters' identities, the voters put the envelopes into the ballot box and signed the voter list.
French electoral law codifies fairly strict procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote collection and no envelopes are added except for voters who have been counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped a woman from Switzerland and returned her cellphone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendant arrived at court with his face covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident happened is temporarily closed while emergency services personnel are freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged at Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted because his image has been widely disseminated to the public.
This is common in other parts of England, but the Scottish courts work differently, and the court sees the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee believes "journalists appear to be treading a dangerous path if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which has full responsibility, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made until there is an indictment.
According to leaks, the document will mention border disputes, which Palestine claims are in accordance with the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered in the report include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the country for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow the military presence for only five years.
The sharpshooter in the supplemental pest control trial was closely monitored by forest rangers, because the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers who meet the requirements are accepted into the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage and NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly swore in the nine members of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP, previously as part of a series of actions to direct the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The following protests involving violence were sometimes sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burn injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan stated that it is aware of 27 incidents related to those devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very disappointing."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office says no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages were successfully rescued, and at least six people were confirmed dead.
Six detainees, including children and elderly people, were released early, as was a Filipino photographer.
The photographer replaced the old woman because he needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was then shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research shows that if given hormones, fetal lung maturation occurs faster.
Xinhua reported that government investigators successfully secured two flight recorder 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Very unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even more so... I loved her and will definitely miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people who cast their votes before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of the people who participated in the poll agree with this view, which hopes that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
On the extreme sides of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist will swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness is in doubt.
He/She couldn't use the medicine needed to overcome the pain because it was banned in the Sports Games.
Curtis Cooper, a brilliant mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the finding using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how this planet was formed, especially how the Earth was formed, since comets collided with the early Earth.
Cuomo, 53 years old, started being governor at the beginning of this year and signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the news "political gossip and nonsense."
It seems like he wants to nominate himself to become president in 2016.
NextGen is a system declared by the FAA to make airplanes fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reducing carbon emissions.
This system uses satellite-based technology, which is significantly different from older, land-based radar technology. This allows air traffic controllers to guide aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transportation will be operating and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and park and ride facilities are not available on land.
Concern over the lack of transportation increases the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A research paper published on Thursday in the journal Science reports on the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that this new species evolved in just two generations, even though this process was believed to take longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza konirostris.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. Gold can be rolled into a very small shape.
Gold can be drawn into fine wire, which can be twisted and woven. Gold can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made very thin, and adheres to other metals. Gold is made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using carrot juice.
Radish juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions ("H" in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has had its electron removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, using a clean damp cloth, knead until it forms a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro already had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of the waste disposal system have been found in homes in the cities of Minoan Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
There were also toilet facilities in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Greek civilization, toilet facilities sometimes became public baths where men and women gathered together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in outer space receive signals and then reflect them back down, almost instantaneously.
Satellites are sent to outer space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in outer space because the Earth's atmosphere deflects some of the light and blurs our vision.
Giant rockets over 100 feet tall are needed to place satellites or telescopes high above the sky.
The wheel has changed the world extraordinarily. The greatest benefit of the wheel for us is transportation that is much easier and faster.
Thanks to the wheel, there are carts, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Below, there are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and rusa deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including pets) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the right position, a specific task that each cat performs, which makes them not compete with each other.
Lions are cats that most like to live in groups, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
In essence, they usually have close relationships with each other, forming a large family due to sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are very similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
With the physique of a perfect athlete, tigers can climb (although not expertly), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times stronger than a strong human.
Tigers belong to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but more like a growling and shrieking sound.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. Ocelots catch frogs, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing the prey's location and tracking the ground.
It can see clearly in the dark with night vision, and move very quietly. The ocelot hunts its prey by blending in with its surroundings and then ambushing it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from its original main population (for example, if they move to a range of hills or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot move back) they will often encounter a different environment from where they were before.
This new environment has several different resources and competitors, so this new population needs different characteristics and adaptations to become a strong competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear very different, to the point that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, meaning the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is inhaled by humans, and plants absorb carbon dioxide that is exhaled by humans (that is, breath out).
Plants make their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. Plants also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything, except its own kind.
Its long jaw is adorned with 70 teeth as sharp as razors, along with an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there is no escape for whatever has entered.
You don't know for sure yet, but its tongue might be forked. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even cannibalism.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even a large dinosaur like a T. rex is no match for it.
While most of their food isn't foreign to us, the Romans did have strange or unusual foods, such as deer fawn, snails, slugs, and a type of mouse called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the commoners and women touch their food while sitting in chairs, wealthy men prefer to eat bajamba together, where they lounge leaning against each other while eating from the jamba.
The food of the ancient Romans could not have included side dishes that came to Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or chocolate beans, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a main temple, which was considered the god's home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and priests tried to fulfill the gods' needs through ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and a sanctuary inside that only priests can enter.
Sometimes pyramids specifically shaped like towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, his house is not really necessary.
A large part of Jewish family life takes place outdoors.
Women are cooking in the open field; the shops are just tables set up facing the road. Stone is used for building houses.
There are no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood is very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled far to the west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo people already lived there at that time.
Even though each country was once 'part of Scandinavia', there are many differences between the societies, kingdoms, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have already watched the movie National Treasure, you might think of a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of that document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence document are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The writing appears at the bottom of the document, positioned upside down.
Although the writer is not definitely known, it is known that in its early days, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up in storage.
So, that note was added only as a brand.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
This was governed by "Vichy" French people. These French people had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the colonizers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, an attack called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned back towards Germany.
Civilization is the single culture possessed by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city-state, and it also explains about the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of states. Civilization's culture implies the inheritance of knowledge across generations, cultural traces that remain and are naturally mixed.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a worthy civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen original member states formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had little power to enforce taxes, and, because there was no national judicial or executive body, it depended on the authority of the states, which often did not cooperate, to implement all laws.
Congress has no authority to override tax and duty laws between states.
That article requires unanimous consent from all states before it can be amended, and the states have a low opinion of the central government, so their representatives are often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world, and they won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because of its cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors recorded the name of the island there as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in the production of native seeds and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and established Taiwan as a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of 3 main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the place originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photo image format in the world is 35mm, which became the dominant film size close to the analog film era.
Until today it is still being produced, but what is more important is the aspect ratio that has been inherited by the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The actual size is 35mm, which is a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the whole-number ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family format, for example) are the same as or approximately close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and often promoted, is a simple rule that creates dynamism while maintaining the order of an image.
This indicates that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together, despite many differences in language and culture.
His power, which encompasses everything, influences everyone, both the king and the common people.
One of the many principles of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church donations exist for that reason.
The central power of the church was held by Rome for over a thousand years, and the centralization of power and money has made many people question whether this principle is fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off crucial military and civilian income, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international treaties.
England is mining international waters to prevent any ships from entering all parts of the ocean, causing danger to neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany extended a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of the majority of the population and citizens was being unmoving and confined.
After witnessing the horror and brutality of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such events in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his name, a book of poetry, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different time periods; each Chinese stage or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty, the lifespan of the provinces was unstable. The most well-known period from this era is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During the period of fierce warfare that occurred between many nobles who were fighting over the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
Many social and political impacts included the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that language belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
And after the Revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of ranks being based on class, they are now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very drawn to things beyond worldly life. He often secluded himself in a cave known as 'Hira' on Mount 'Nur' (light) to meditate.
Muhammad's solitude in the cave, enduring from time to time, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Resting at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is truly isolated from the outside world.
It's not even easy to find at all, even if people know it exists. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
There is nothing to see except the bright and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little in the world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead of Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "superior arc" mark looks like a V and the "inferior arc" mark resembles a hook or a square with its bottom line missing.
The top means you have to start at the tip and pull the bow, and the bottom means you have to start at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and aim the bow.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is harder and more firm.
Feel free to mark it up yourself with a pencil, but remember that the bowing marks printed there have a musical reason, so they should usually be followed.
The dreaded King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette with their two young children (Marie Theresa, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
In the carriage, those people returned to Paris surrounded by a group of people who shouted and yelled threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open their window wide.
In one place, a man from the mob waved the head of the slain Royal guard in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The expenses of the US colonial war to subdue the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to finance a large part of the expenses and floating bond interest in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great benefit derived from this self-indulgent act towards the Filipino people for so long is a primary benefit of the US colonization.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the situation that led to the formation of the order.
The time when those events occurred is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by agreement, ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses various ideas in practice, ranging from technological impetus or technological imperative to a fixed understanding that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and its realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology, in turn, has a distinct influence on society, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, we can have the opinion that the existence of cars causes the development of highways.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership can lead to more significant accidents on the road, which in turn drives the discovery of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a great influence that is shaped by culture, and it draws from the writers Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time customs and cultures associated with that geography emerge, and this, along with the place of society, is better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the center of modern fashion, so too was Constantinople known as the center of fashion in old Europe.
It was well known as a center of luxury from around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined since the twelfth century because of the agreement that the Crusaders returned bringing various gifts such as silk and spices that were much more valuable than what was available in the Byzantine market.
That was the time when the center of fashion shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th–11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Even so, because the communication channels are slow, trends in the West can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the European Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and usually organic system that uses native seeds stored in the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other simpler methods to maximize yields.
Looking at its history, most farmers practice subsistence agriculture which still exists in many developing countries today.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel alienated from the norms of society, allowing these people to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine one subculture's difference can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic factors, or a combination of them all.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the adoption of symbolic and distinctive styles, which include fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by depicting several cases of unfortunate children who experience neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse, and are not responded to by adults during their upbringing.
Children like that are called "feral" or uncivilized. Some feral children have been confined by the community (usually by their own parents); in some cases, this child abandonment is caused by the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual and physical disabilities.
Street children may have experienced abuse or severe childhood trauma before being abandoned or running away.
The others are suspected to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the jungle all alone in hardship.
When raised entirely by animals other than humans, feral children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like the animal that raised them, such as fear and indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather assistance that provides support for individuals experiencing a new learning experience, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Scaffolding is realized in the software and is intended to question, encourage, and explain the stages that might become challenges for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care for, and educate, but it happens.
We feel that the orphanage system is a safe place for these children.
The foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Orphanages should provide all the needs that were previously lacking in the homes where those children were before they were brought there.
The internet combines two elements: mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristics that distinguish the internet create an additional dimension in the approach of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are recommended as important motivations for internet usage (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" are also mentioned as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated viewer reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has enabled important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial expressions that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is stated that a person can know if someone is lying by accurately interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in the newspaper article "The President's Speech," showed that people who fail to understand what others say due to brain damage seem to be able to accurately understand and assess sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities in understanding human behavior might exist in animals like local dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between two sets with each generation.
In the open savanna, it is difficult for primates whose digestive systems are similar to humans to satisfy their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, the failure to do so has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available and accessible plant-based resource is protein found in leafy greens and legumes, but these materials are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but it provides a high protein content that contains all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that was probably similar to what chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disturbance is an intentional awakening process during a person's normal sleep and falling asleep again in a short time afterwards (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a sufficiently quiet alarm clock to bring your sibling to consciousness without actually waking them up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, it can be replaced on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known diuretics) before going to sleep, forcing the person to wake up to go to the toilet.
The measure of peace within a person is proportional to the amount of pressure in their body and soul.
The lower the pressure, the better the life force. Everyone has the possibility of finding peace and eternal tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to achieving this goal is their own stress and denial.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but continued through the Mahayana path of compassion and with many Indian Yoga techniques.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces everything.
With Kundalini Yoga, this Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
This Tibetan meditation center is Deity Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the destruction of systems, processes, and culture caused countries to clash.
And two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
The Cold War lasted for up to 40 years and was fought by proxy armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian base.
Even though these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking eastern Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods over such distances is the most effective way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Naval forces have traditionally ensured that allied nations maintain the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, dealing with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were then trying to move people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to help England.
At the same time, the German navy, mostly using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allied forces had lost, Germany might have subdued England like other European countries.
Goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Cultures and ancient tribes began raising goats to make it easier to obtain milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Tame goats are usually kept in herds that are released in the hills or other grassy areas, often herded by shepherds who are usually children or teenagers, similar to shepherds known to the general public. These herding methods are still used to this day.
The cart was made in England at the beginning of the 16th century.
Even though the cart is only made of a unidirectional arrangement of wood, people can use horses to pull it so that it can run faster and carry more loads than on worse roads.
The cross-knot was initially used to hold the rails in place. Gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more effective if they were given iron restraints on top.
This is a general rule, but iron makes the wooden wheels of carts wear out faster.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, iron rails were used for the first time in their entirety.
The first known form of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright about two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Initially, Australopithecus was not accustomed to walking upright.
Bipedal species were found in the form of Australopithecus skulls dating from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs since 7 million years ago.
We can start living in harmony with nature, we can join environmental care movements, and we can also become people who participate in reducing the suffering of the future to a certain extent.
This is the same as the handling treatment in many incidents. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we must find out the root cause of the problem, and we must stop the problem.
Actually, it is clear that the world is changing due to the development of human knowledge and technology, and the problems are getting bigger because the human population is too large and because of the excessive human lifestyle.
After the document was adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and clerk Charles Thomson, was then sent to the printing house of John Dunlap, located several blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The letter was read for the first time in public by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of the letters was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and was read to his troops in New York on July 9th, a copy of which arrived in London on August 10th.
There are 25 known Dunlap broadsides, which are surviving copies of the original letter. The original handwritten manuscript has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't realize that birds are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about this bird still look similar to dinosaurs.
It has scaly and clawed feet, lays eggs, and walks using its two hind legs like a T-Rex.
In reality, almost all computers used today rely on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values: 0 or 1, which are called binary digits – or bits, as they are known in computer terms.
Poisoning that occurs within the body may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The most obvious clue about poisoning in the body might be the presence of medicine containers or chemical substances in the house that are open.
Check the instructions for first aid for specific poisons.
The term "hamo" is used by pest experts themselves in a formal sense for this group of pests.
This term comes from the ancient intimacy of bedbugs, which are creatures that have adapted to become human parasites.
Both Assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in nests or reside on their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it one of the most common neurological disorders affecting young people and adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research suggests that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising the baby is not in their best interest, or the best interest of their child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adopting a child, the biological parents relinquish their rights as parents so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods. This method essentially guides most scientific research.
Not only that, experiments, experiments are tests used to reduce one or more possible guesses, asking questions and conducting reviews also guide scientific research.
People who conduct specific research on animals and plants and philosophers focus on classical writings and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
Because knowledge about Greece had declined, the West found itself cut off from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are truly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production throughout the biological clock.
Circadian rhythm, which is not merely a response to external cues, has been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is an independent oscillator that maintains a cycle that runs freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading opinions that DNA is the material related to heredity.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into a bacterium.
These two people performed two experiments marking either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material that is affected, and whether the affected cell is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by offspring, while mutations elsewhere can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts public attention to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting gardens to learn about the environment.
Examples include visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Kalimantan.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to their workplaces while passing people whose destination is the place they just left.
In this back-and-forth transportation, every stakeholder can be said to be connected, and supporting, a private car-based transportation system.
Modern natural science shows that the large carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has slowly supported human changes for the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses the transportation system. Most people complain about the transportation arrangement.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about things like water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why does the transportation system cause such complaints, why does it fail every day? Are transportation experts incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the relationships they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers often behave within a reasonably consistent range; and as such, traffic flow possesses reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To indicate a better traffic flow, this relationship has been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship assists in the planning, design, and operation of major road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helps them more easily evade predators, and be more effective in finding food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage because they can fold their wings back along their bodies.
That's why they have more small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people think they are right, but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
It seems logical, because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles.
20 percent of all the water flowing out of the rivers on this planet into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River flows for 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although pyramid construction at Giza continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and excellence of the Giza pyramids in terms of their construction methods.
The New Kingdom Egyptians admired the historical buildings made by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and as its official language.
Italian is also a language used daily by a large portion of the people who work in the city, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the first chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in their elemental form and are relatively easy to mine using rudimentary tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, stated that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements. Those four are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although they also say that something can be changed into a new substance to help form what we see.
An alloy is actually a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
The elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys containing a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny elementary particles commonly called atoms.
This atom is so small that trillions of atoms can fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, pencils are good friends to many people when they are first released.
Unfortunately, when the new way of writing emerged, the pencil's position and usefulness were diminished.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, never getting near a pencil sharpener anymore.
We can only guess what will happen to this keyboard when something newer arrives.
Atomic bombs work on the principle that energy is needed to bind the nucleus of an atom with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Therefore, splitting the atom's nucleus means releasing some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that the atom is prone to decay with a slight disturbance or without any disturbance at all.
The surface of the Moon consists of rock and dust. The Moon's outermost layer is called the crust.
This crust is approximately 70 km thick on its nearest side and 100 km thick on its farthest side.
It is thinner below sea level and thicker below higher ground.
The near side likely has more maria because its crust is thinner. This makes it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on discovering what makes people moved or attracted to the content.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been ingrained since they grew up to adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them desire the things they do, and what it is about their environment that will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, there are two behaviors that can arise when a manager begins to lead people who were formerly their colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or one of the girls).
A leader like this has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, evaluating work performance, delegating responsibilities, and keeping people accountable.
On the other end, this host transforms into an unknown person who feels they need to change everything that has been done by the team and make it their own work.
Actually, the host is truly responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often creates tension between the leader and the entire team.
Virtual teams are bound by the same rules as conventional teams, but there is a slight difference.
Team members often function as contact points for their direct physical groups.
They often have more autonomy in managing themselves compared to conventional team members because their team can meet across diverse time zones, which might not be understood by local management.
The presence of a so-called "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a special component of virtual teams.
This "invisible team" is a management team to which every team member reports. This "invisible team" determines the basic rules for each member.
Why would an organization go through a time-consuming process to establish a learning group? The goal of applying the organizational learning concept to its implementation is innovation.
When available resources are used effectively throughout all functional parts of a group, creative power of thought and brilliant ideas can occur.
As a result, how an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative way of working to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can actively bring about renewal, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as share knowledge and group learning.
Angel (2006) explains Continuum as a method used to help a group achieve a higher level of work performance.
Neurologists provide concrete evidence for approaches based on research into the investigation of consciousness. This makes the area of research narrower and more precise.
The relationship between the science of brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain diseases, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in various mental functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and examine the structure and workings of the brain in ways that were never before possible.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create training examples that help us understand how our brains work.
Although AI is often associated with the fictional and imaginative interpretations of science fiction stories, AI has become a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research on AI includes making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controls, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face.
Such things have become a separate field, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI architecture is now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, similar to what has been done in some home computers and video game software.
Field trips are a big part of every class. Teachers usually like to take their students to places that can't be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution for virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire works of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing stories about virtual field trips can also be a great way to reflect on a particular journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are still stored online as clippings.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. When students often begin their writing experience on blogs with messy grammar and writing, the presence of readers usually changes that.
Because readers are usually meticulous, blog writers are starting to try to beautify their writing to avoid negative assumptions.
Writing a blog also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy reader interest inspires students to be smarter and more engaging (Toto, 2004).
Writing blogs is a tool that can foster collaboration and encourage students to learn beyond what is typically taught daily in ordinary schools.
The proper use of blogs "can make students more accustomed to not jumping to conclusions and to thinking more sharply; through diligently responding to materials on the internet, students can explain their position in relation to other people's writing, as well as explain their point of view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is an attractive part of Canada, is bilingual, and presents a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south, there is Niagara Falls and to the north, it is home to the natural beauty of Muskoka and its untouched surroundings.
All of these things, along with Ontario's more prominent position as the "real" Canada, are considered by outsiders.
The vast area to the north is more sparsely populated, and some of it is even forest that has never been inhabited.
As a comparison, the large population is surprising: there are more African Americans living in the US than the total number of citizens in Canada.
Islands in East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and could be considered its own continent in terms of its unique wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or affiliated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to those countries, spreading as far as the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: It's best for every female tourist to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It would be even more beautiful if you wore a ring (just as long as it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can lead to what someone might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for women to be followed, grabbed by the arm, or other things.
Be firm in rejecting men, don't be afraid to stand your ground (different culture or not, it doesn't make it permissible!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merenids as a strategically located port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and then rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and later the city was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is the most attractive place to shop compared to anywhere else in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a range of small items, but all of it is just for tourists.
Goma is the tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the easternmost region near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava originating from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried almost all of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is quite safe, any travel outside of Goma must be investigated first to understand the situation in North Kivu province, which is still turbulent.
This city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use motorcycle taxis (ojek) to get around Goma. The normal (local) fare is around ~500 Congolese Francs for a short distance.
Combined with the difficulty of visiting the place, "Timbuktu" became a metaphor for a strange and distant place.
Today, Timbuktu is a city that is impoverished, although its name makes it an attraction for tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the site was added to the list of world heritage in danger, due to the threat of its desertification.
That city was a major stop during Henry Louis Gates's filming of Special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
That city is very different from other cities in that country, because it has more Arabic influence than African influence.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa stretching along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The garden covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct natural regions, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions, considered an asset of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation fees and entrance fees to the park.
This might also be useful for people who buy a Wild Card, which provides access to gardens in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island became the origin of the name of the Hong Kong region, which is a place considered by many tourists as a primary focus.
The arrangement of tall buildings makes the Hong Kong skyline a dramatic picture of sparkling towers reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, it is best to leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across from the island.
Much of the city's development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that was taken by the British colonizers as their own; if you want to find evidence of colonization there, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarban has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest located in the Indian part is called Sundarban National Park.
This forest isn't just mangrove swamp — it's among the last remaining refuges of the great jungle that once covered the land around the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², most of which is wetlands/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for protected wildlife, now estimated to be home to about 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the intercity (crossing the river) bus terminal throughout the day, although the majority, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Because inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
The majority in that area use small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and strong.
Taking a taxi together is a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as the Paro turnoff (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. This bridge stretches along the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance under that bridge is 15 meters. This construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not allowed to be opened to traffic until March 2017.
This bridge is scheduled to be fully completed in September 2017, when the inspection facilities in Brazil are expected to be finished.
The Guaraní are the most distinct indigenous people who now live in what is called Eastern Paraguay, living as traditional hunters who also farm to meet the living needs of their families.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two roads that are 3.50 meters wide.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "Giant Province of the Indies", was born from the meeting of Spanish colonizers and native populations.
The Spanish started their colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has been able to maintain the character and personality of its original inhabitants.
Argentina is also often mentioned for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition this year will take place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Team competitions and smaller competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about this competition and where to buy tickets to watch this polo match, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The currency used in the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is fixed at par with the British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the one and only bank on those islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West shopping area.
English is generally accepted everywhere on these islands, and can also be used in the form of credit cards. Sterling and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are not accepted, although British and American money may be accepted; it is best to ask the seller beforehand how to pay.
It is very unlikely to exchange Falkland Islands money once you leave the island, so it's best to exchange the money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, when it is summer there, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a mild warm climate; in the summer, it's usually above +30°C.
Winters can be very cold: freezing temperatures are rare, but the wind and the cold can make it feel much colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals have often encountered humans, wild animals remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the rules made by the park rangers, keep a distance of at least 100 steps/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 steps/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how tame an animal may seem, American bison, horned deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep their distance. These animals are large, wild, and can cause harm, so it's best to just leave the animals alone.
Besides that, it's important to remember that strong smells can attract bears and other animals, so it's best to avoid bringing or eating strongly scented food and to always maintain the cleanliness of the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was formed in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
That port was the site of a naval standoff in 1889 when seven navies from Germany, America, and England refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank at that time, except for one English ship that survived. Almost 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of the high chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the two harbors that exist in Auckland. The most famous are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most have pohutukawa trees as a place to take shelter.
The beaches on Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the coastal area of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes crowded and have stalls along the beach. Swimming there is safe.
The local palm wine is called 'Number One'; it's not the best quality palm wine, but it tastes sweet and refreshing. Other local palm wine is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines might taste better.
Tap water from here can also be drunk, but if you're afraid, just drink bottled water that you buy.
For Australians, hearing the term 'flat white' coffee is unusual. Strong black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino is mixed with a lot of cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is sold a lot in Belgium. Fruit juice is expensive, but it tastes good.
Many tourist trips are conducted each year to see coral reefs, and many accidents due to coral reefs occur during these trips.
Whatever happens, follow the instructions of those on duty, obey the rules, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are often found living near the coast and near river mouths from October to April since 1770. They are also often found on other days outside of that time.
That shark is there, but it very rarely attacks humans. In fact, that shark is often afraid and swims away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't usually live in the sea, they more often live in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance before traveling gives visitors peace of mind because they already have accommodation when they arrive there.
Travel agencies may have partnerships with specific accommodations, although you can book other accommodations, such as camping, through the travel agency.
Travel agents usually often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and flight and accommodation packages.
They can also give relatives time to think or need time to prepare documents (such as visas).
Every change or reservation must notify the agent first and cannot be communicated directly to the accommodation.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most officials consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you must arrive earlier to get a campsite near the music.
Even though the music on the main stage may be over, remember that there might be parts of the festival that will continue playing music until late at night.
Some festivals have dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabins, because passing through ice causes a noise that is quite terrifying for even the most influential.
The Saint Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the requirements).
Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
Those people usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them in place.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and every smart gambler knows the need to stay sober.
Anyone who is going to travel at high altitude or across mountains must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
On roads that are icy or snowy, the friction is usually low and you can't accelerate or handle the vehicle like you would on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, snow that can bury a brother can fall in a short time.
Visibility may be limited due to falling or blowing snow, or due to condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, slippery and snowy road conditions are very normal in many countries, and traffic is not disrupted by snow that falls throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest attraction in Africa and are a major focus for visitors.
The term "safari" is often used to describe long land journeys to see African wild animals, especially in the savanna forests.
Several animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and equipment, which usually makes it easier for us to see them with the naked eye.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes feel shy, and siblings can see them more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "bushwalking", "hill walking", or simply "walking") includes mountaineering, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Several events will be held at other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become one of the few cities in Asia to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be facing a complex situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but by the end of March almost all cancellation policies due to the coronavirus were not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical ticket prices costing around ¥7,000.
Using a clothes iron can help clothes dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to iron the cloth too hot (it can cause shrinkage, or in severe cases, burning).
There are different methods for purifying water, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In certain areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in other places it needs to be boiled for a few more minutes.
The effectiveness of water filters varies, and you should pay attention to this, so you should consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Explorers may encounter animal pests different from those found in their home village.
Mold can spoil food, cause irritation, or, more seriously, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Diseases that are contagious on their own, or dangerous or deadly wild animals due to necessity, are usually not included as prey.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in specific locations.
The revenue collected from countries and high taxes can sometimes provide sufficient funds, especially for goods like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont offers some of the most outstanding driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently traversing winding rural roads through wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on village roads, always be careful: steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp turns dominate.
The permitted vehicle speed limit is clearly lower than the section after and before it — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and strict adherence to it is even more important than the reverse.
Oddly enough, cell phone service is stronger here than in many other places along this road, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German dried cakes are very delicious, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and diverse, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Dried fruit is common, and apples are cooked into dried fruit throughout the year, and cherries and plums make an appearance throughout the summer.
Many German baking ingredients also highlight almonds, hazelnuts, and other nut plants. The famous cakes are often paired especially with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a rich but small dry cake, try a cake section called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
