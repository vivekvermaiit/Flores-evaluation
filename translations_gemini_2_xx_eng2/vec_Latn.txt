This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but it provides details that fossils usually don't give, such as the color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this beast were chestnut brown on top with a pale carrot color on the bottom.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but they had other characteristics of feathers like barbs and barbules, scholars have thought that the rachis was probably a subsequent evolutionary development compared to the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers have suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the down of a chick.
Scholars have suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers from adulthood and not the down of a chick.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

They discovered that the Sun worked on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, rotation, and that's it.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is relative to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was trying to find would have been caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth, causing the tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter has an effect on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that a large part of dark matter is found around a galaxy as a halo, and is made of many tiny particles.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "really very problematic and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."

In France, voting has usually been a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth, put a pre-printed sheet indicating their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting register.
The French electoral law codifies the procedure in a fairly strict way.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of voters regularly counted and authorized.
The candidates can send representatives to monitor every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict control following specific procedures.

In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the one who came first, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the one who came in ninth place, GyÃ¶ngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the group did not finish the race, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen computer and cell phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and computer."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, nobody got hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was closed for a while while the emergency services pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya, from that moment, was in the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh accused of having killed his son.
She is in custody awaiting referral to trial and trial, but any testimonial evidence could be contaminated because her image has been made too public.
This is something that happens often in the United Kingdom, but the justice system in Scotland works differently and the courts have seen that publishing photos can be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says "it seems journalists are walking a dangerous line by publishing photos etcetera of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for proceedings, told journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the committal for trial.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Apparently, other topics discussed were the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees that this presence should only be for five years.
Those who participated in the supplementary disinfestation trial had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, while the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In association with the NPWS, the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program were deployed.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the current director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four sharpshooters selected for the first shooting operation received complete safety instructions and training.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine people.
It's the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, arose from the fact that there haven't been elections, some of which should have been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing six fires with four people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan has stated that they are aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week META said that Apple had been informed of another 34 overheating incidents that the company defined as "not serious".
The ministry responded, saying that the delay of Apple's report is "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency office said that there was no damage in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released today along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed the bathroom. Mendoza was killed.
Liggins continued in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He studied to be a midwife and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he began studying premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would have accelerated the lung maturation of the child.
Xinhua said that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' from the flight recorders.
Even the fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Something unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, saying that "Luna was crazy like me...maybe even more so...I love her and I miss her...I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, those who do not want Australia to be a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey agree with this idea and want Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those interviewed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
She was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games for the Olympic gold medal, but due to her complaints, her health was questioned.
He wasn't able to get the medicines to overcome his pain because they are banned by the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25th discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people have checked the discovery using various tools and programs since the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth formed, given that comets struck the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law that legalizes same-sex marriage.
Regarding the rumors, he said they are "chatter and political nonsense."
He says that he will run to be president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow airplanes to fly with shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology different from the old ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to track aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No special transport has been put into operation, surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and interchange parking are not available on the ground.
Fears about the limited transportation have raised the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science deals with the birth of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have said that the new species evolved in only two generations, even though it is thought that this process lasted much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic finch species of Darwin, Geospiza Fortis, and the migrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn like a fine thread that can be twisted and crushed. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be made so thin and placed on other metals. It can be made so fine that sometimes it was used to decorate the figures made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by how many hydrogen ions (the H of pH) there are in the substance being examined.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons removed (given that the hydrogen atom is made of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, squeeze to make a ball.
The damp sweat of your hand will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house connected to a complex sewage system.
The remains of sewers were found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath buildings where men and women went together, mixed.
When someone calls you from very far away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and sends it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts the light and our vision a bit.
You need a rocket bigger than 100 feet to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing that the wheel has done for us is to give us a more comfortable and faster means of transport.
They brought the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are felines of medium size that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including house cats) that eat many smaller animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special place that every feline has and that keeps them away from competition with others.
Lions are the most social felines, they live in large groups called prides.
The groups are made up of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
The women are usually closely related to each other, it's a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides are a bit like wolf or dog packs, animals incredibly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and equally deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not well), swim, make great leaps, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the lion's powerful one, but more like a string of bad words shouted.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the ocelot follows and finds animals to eat (prey) with its sense of smell, sensing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and then jumping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from where they came (as if they move beyond a mountain or a river, or move to a new island in such a way that they are no longer easily able to return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one where they were before.
This new environment has many resources and many competitors, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they need the same adaptations as before.
As the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they start to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands and even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which in practice means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (or, breathe out).
Plants nourish themselves from the sun with photosynthesis. And they also provide shade.
We make houses with plants, and clothes with plants. A large part of what we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaur was the strongest predator of its time, it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
In his mouth, he had more than 70 teeth sharpened like knives, and another row was on the palate; there was no escape for anyone who got caught.
We are not sure, but it might be that it had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps it was even a cannibal.
He would grab anything that entered the water; even a beast like a T. Rex would have met a bad end.
Even though many of their foods might seem normal to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual things like wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of dormouse called a "ghiro."
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting on chairs, the nobles held banquets together reclining on their sides while they ate.
The food of the ancient Romans could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, coconut, and no ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for all their divinities, which was the house of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to attend to the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priest could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary of the god.
In the mild climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
A large part of the life of a Jewish family was outside.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just stalls on the street. The houses were made of stone.
There weren't great forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive there.
In Greenland, few people live. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland because he had killed someone, and going west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even though he made his discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Even though every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776." These words are visible at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Even though nobody knows who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning this large document (measuring 29Â¾ inches by 24Â½ inches) was rolled up to be put away.
Therefore, it's likely that this note was added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by Vichy France. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working for the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies had invaded the south of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the forces of Free France had liberated southern France and were moving towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared among a good group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, in relation to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas which means city or city-state, and that in some way defines the greatness of society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. A culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through the various generations, a cultural imprint that lasts, and a fair diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical traces and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component, under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to demand taxes, and since there was no executive or national judiciary to enforce all its laws, it relied on the state authorities, who often did not cooperate.
They had no authority to abolish fiscal laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles require unanimous consent from all states before being modified, and the states took the central government with such lightness that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with the German national football team, the second team that has won the most in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are especially famous in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the biggest is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the groups of islands it has, Japan is often called an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by called the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southeastern part of Taiwan, beginning to change the aboriginal practices of grain production and employing Chinese workers in the rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western part and the northern coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it gave control of Taiwan to Japan, who governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better idea of what they used to be like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been rebuilt, and the restoration has been ongoing for ten years now.
For example, the most common still image photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the film format par excellence at the end of the analog film era.
It was made again only recently, but the most important thing is that its aspect ratio was inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, in a somewhat confusing way, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is consequently said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example the APS format group) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The much abused and often criticized rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
She says that the best place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion held the European states together despite the differences in language and customs.
His power seized everyone, from kings to the poor.
One of the main doctrines of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate tribulation and misery and that the church's money is there for that purpose.
The center of control of the Church was in Rome for more than a thousand years, and all this power and money made many people wonder if the doctrine had been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, the English established a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was successful, cutting off essential civilian and military support, even though this blockade was a violation of an internationally accepted law generally codified by many international agreements in the two centuries prior.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to block entire sections of the ocean to all ships, causing damage even to neutral ships.
Since there was little to be done against this tactic, Germany expected a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude of almost all citizens and countries was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another similar thing in the future.
In 1884 Tesla went to the United States of America to work with the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States without money, with a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the various periods of the year: each phase of China or each family that was in command was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was a turbulent period with the provinces divided. The most famous of these periods was that of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were terrible wars between the various nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the decimal metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Even after the Revolution and the occupation, they were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious to succeed.
The same goes for the military because instead of classifying the army based on class, now it was based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other repressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became famous as "Hira'," on his mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The same cave, surviving through the ages, offers a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it wasn't at all easy to find it even if we knew it existed. Once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
One can see nothing but the clear and very beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead of Egypt, has many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the most impressive), several small tombs, various temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Cheops' wives and family members.
The "arc up" symbol looks like a V and the "arc down" symbol like a bracket or a square without the bottom side.
That means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and that means you should start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow stroke high up usually produces a softer sound, while a bow stroke lower down usually produces a louder and more decisive sound.
Feel free to write your markings in pencil, but remember that the printed ink markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
He terrorized King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, on October 6, 1789, at Versailles they were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and uttering threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At a certain point, someone from the crowd showed the queen, who was terrified, the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover the majority of the expenses and the interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Naturally, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would have constituted the fundamental conquests of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that incentivized the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history from the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000â€“1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism has many ideas, from technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by a basic logic together with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence, and conversely that technology has "effects" on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car's engine inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a network of national roads is not economically viable solely for a few cars, therefore new methods of production are being developed to lower the cost of owning a car.
Having many cars also leads to many accidents on the roads, and this leads to the invention of new medical techniques to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures arose linked to that geography, and these, being in harmony with society, proved better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris today is known for being the capital of fashion, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It is known for having been a center of luxury from the 400s to the 1100s.
Its esteem declined in the twelfth century especially because the Crusaders had returned with silk and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was during this period that the title of Capital of Luxury passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may have lagged behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the era was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons on their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture aimed at producing enough food only to satisfy the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses saved seeds originating from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who think alike, who feel neglected by social standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished according to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or sex of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or generated by a specific combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashions, mannerisms, and ways of speaking.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, have not been followed from a social point of view by adults during their upbringing.
These kids are called "wild children". Some of them were placed within boundaries by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability of the child.
These wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or before escaping.
It is thought that others were raised by animals; it is said that some lived in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that cared for them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
What is defined as scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides assistance to people who are facing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
These frameworks, called scaffolds, can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and they have the purpose of discussing, suggesting, and explaining procedures that could be difficult for the individual student to manage.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that isn't supportive, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safety net for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide everything necessary that is lacking in the home from which the children were previously taken.
The internet unites elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet have led to other dimensions of uses and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that one can understand if a person is telling lies by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess someone's sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals like dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has demonstrated that there exist two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human one to satisfy its amino acid needs by gathering them from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, the impossibility of doing so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and finally death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large quantity of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" somewhat in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during the normal period of sleep and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you back to a conscious state without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm while you're sleeping, it can be positioned elsewhere in the room, thus forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve consuming a lot of liquids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that characterizes a person is related to the amount of tension present in the body and in the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been extended through the Mahayana path of love and through many techniques typical of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of global love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through the yoga postures themselves, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment takes shape.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading the USSR and the United States to collaborate. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures caused the decline of nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and thus began the Cold War.
It would continue for the next 40 years and would be truly fought by proxy armies and on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope remained that of retreating and reorganizing along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans had already become outdated almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union attacked the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Peace of Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of navies has traditionally been to ensure that the nation maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this stuff was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't been successful, Germany probably would have been able to conquer England as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that the horse was first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had begun to keep them for milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often controlled by goatherds who were often young boys and teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
The carriages had already been built in England in the 16th century.
Even though the wagons were just wooden planks put next to each other, they allowed the horses that pulled them to go faster and pull heavier loads compared to the ruined roads of the time.
The sleepers were placed almost immediately to hold the tracks in position. But little by little it became clear that the tracks would have been better with a steel bar on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron damages the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first entirely iron railway was made.
The first means of transport was feet; humans started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means upright man) emerged.
Those who were before, the Australopithecus, usually didn't walk upright.
Bipedalism has been found in the fossils of australopithecines dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living better together with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can also become more active in trying to reduce future suffering in some way.
In many cases, this is like treating the symptoms. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root cause of the problems and solve them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become even bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten copy signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was then sent just a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night they made between 150 and 200 copies of what became known as "Dunlap flyers."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy ended up in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap flyers that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive now. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are indicated with binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately visible. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open box of medicines or toxic chemicals for the house.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The word "zimeso" is used by entomologists in a formal way for this group of insects.
It derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects adapted to infest humans.
Bed bugs and dust mites are annoying; they are adapted to live in the darkness or in the host's home.
In all the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it the primary neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have seen that women have twice the chance of developing MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that having a child is not in their interest, or in the child's interest.
These couples can decide to try to adopt a child.
In an adoption, the rights of the natural parents terminate so that another couple can act as parents to the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides almost all scientific discoveries.
However, it's not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations guides scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers were focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
The ideas of Aristotle were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
Once the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production with biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will maintain a free-running period even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was made of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, labeling the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to offspring, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is popular with people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the fauna and flora.
Examples of activities to do on-site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and getting to know the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people drive away from the small country villages to go to work, and they are passed by others who are going to work where they have just left.
In this transportation system, everyone is connected in some way, and it supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now says that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses public transport. Almost everyone complains about public transport.
In developed countries, it's rare to hear complaints similar to those about the quality of the water or bridges that collapse.
Why do public transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they have problems every day? Don't transport engineers understand anything? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable coherence and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with planning, designing, and the operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This gives them the possibility to hide from predators in many small places.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the silverfish and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but others thought the opposite, that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and also the other stars).
This seems like a sensible thing, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest on Earth. It has more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river; in some places, it's six miles wide.
A good 20 percent of the water from the rivers that end up in the planet's oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or in the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at the time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of common use by almost everyone who works for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these could be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals like gold and silver.
There can also be alloys that have a small quantity of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the arrival of newer writing methods, the pencil has ended up on the sidelines and is used less.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, they don't need a pencil sharpener.
One might wonder what will become of the keyboard once something newer comes out.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. The nuclear fission then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split with little or no force.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the plateaus.
There could be seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. There were more opportunities for the lava to come out on the surface.
Theories about content are focused on researching what makes people angry or what they like.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized becoming adults.
This theory looks at what exists within certain people that makes them desire the things they do, and which things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys (or girls)."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they have to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to fractures between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there may be subtle differences.
The members of virtual teams often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a standard team because their teams may be located across different time zones, which might not be understood by the local administration.
Also, the presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administration team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why should an organization want to go through the process that takes time to establish a learning organization? Innovation is a goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
When all available resources are used well across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be seen.
Consequently, the process of an organization that works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) says that the Continuum approach is a method that is used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical strategy regarding his knowledge investigation. Consequently, it narrows the area of investigation and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in this research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors have an effect on behavior and cause changes to certain mental functions.
The new technologies allow us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Even if Artificial Intelligence has something of fantasy, it is a very important part of computer science, and it has to do with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in a machine.
The study of AI concerns the creation of machines to automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer requests, and also recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, the artificial intelligence system is often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and in the military field, given that it has been put in many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are a very important thing for every class. Many times the teacher would like to take their students to places where it's not possible to go by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours. Students can see the works in a museum, visit an aquarium, or view art while sitting in class.
Sharing a trip virtually is also a nice way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website is redone, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Even blogs can help students write better. While students often start their blogging experience with grammatical errors and misspelled words, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, what is written in the blog strives to be written better and to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, maintaining a blog "pushes students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to fuel public interest inspires students to be better and more engaging (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning well beyond the normal school day.
Correct use of blogs "can push students to become more analytical and critical; with active responses to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of what others write, in addition to describing their personal perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the beautiful and bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things, and even more, make Ontario appear as the quintessence of Canada according to those who come from outside.
Many areas further north are then populated, and some are almost entirely uninhabited natural areas.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and as far as wildlife is concerned, it's a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was particularly successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama who found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it's better that all the women who travel say they are married, regardless of whether it's true or not.
Better to bring a ring too (as long as it doesn't look like something expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences might mean that what they think are annoyances are not, and it's not strange to be followed, touched, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You must be decisive in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to assert your reasons (cultural differences or not, it's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port, called Anfa, by Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who had established a trading base here.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of knick-knacks, but it's all stuff for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano, which burned most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any other trip outside of Goma must be prepared in such a way as to understand the state of the fighting that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the less expensive gorilla tracking expeditions in Africa.
You can use a motorcycle taxi to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Besides the fact that it's relatively difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" has become a bit of a metaphor for exotic and distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its fame makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS special "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in strong contrast with other cities in the country, because it has a more Arab than African charm.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park has an area of 19,500 kmÂ² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wild animals.
It is one of the most important attractions of South Africa and is considered the symbol of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees.
It might be a good idea to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that tourists visit the most.
The skyline of Hong Kong, made up of a series of buildings, has been compared to a sparkling bar graph, recognizable by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, go to the island and then to Kowloon on the waterfront on the other side.
A large part of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is heavily built on land reclaimed from the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonists took for themselves, and so if you want to see something of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal belt of mangroves in the world, stretching for 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast in the territory of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they also have what remains of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans have an area of 3850 kmÂ², of which a third is water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and an estimate says that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although the majority, particularly those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since interdistrict buses are often full, it's better to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of transport to get to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The air draft under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge has been operational since September 2017, when the control points of the Brazilian customs were completed.
The Guarani were the most significant ethnic group inhabiting Eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes like the GuaycurÃº and the PayaguÃ¡, surviving by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "the gigantic province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is played in December on the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas.
They also play smaller tournaments and matches in other parts of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), whose value is fixed as equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and American currencies might work; check with the relevant party in advance to see what is an acceptable method of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures above 30 degrees are common.
Winter can be disappointingly chilly; temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There isn't a particularly "rainy" or "dry" season; the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's mammals are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from any other wild animal!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, deer, reindeer, bears, and any other large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they didn't keep an appropriate distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Stand up, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, therefore avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep the base camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for a British ocean liner. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the small town resulted in the murder of the great chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is in the middle of two harbors. The most famous ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches, with a bit of shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the wealthy neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
There are beaches for families, sometimes with too many people, with lots of shops. We are safe.
The main local beer is the "Number One", it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to try, but those from New Zealand and Australia might be better.
Tap water is perfectly drinkable, but bottled water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," a cappuccino arrives piled high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the coral reef are done throughout the year, and injuries due to these causes on the reef are rare.
Follow what the authorities say anyway, obey the signs, and pay attention to the safety signals.
Box jellyfish are present near the beaches and the nearby river estuaries from October to April north of the 1770 line. Sometimes they can be found outside of these periods.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the security and peace of mind that there will be a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, even though you can book other places to sleep, like campsites, through a travel agency as well.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer options, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
I can also hold your booking if you need time to think about it or get the documents for your arrival (for example, a visa).
Every modification or request, however, should first go through the agent and not directly to the hotel.
For certain festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals decide to camp on site, and most of these consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get in early to secure a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage has finished, there may be parts of the festival where music is playing until late at night.
Certain festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea from the North in winter, check where the cabin is, because going through the ice causes a horrible noise for everyone involved.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the regulations).
Casinos often make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are often absent, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers in a good mood and keep them spending money.
Certain places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who wants to drive at high latitudes or across mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy road, the grip is low and you can't drive as if you were on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to trap you in a short amount of time.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling snow, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular usage refers to a journey on land to observe the incredible African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Certain animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the vehicles, and the standard equipment allows for a good view.
The lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of a walking excursion, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Certain events will be held in other sites throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might find yourself in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but in March, the cancellation policies did not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most events will cost from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, with the typical ticket selling for 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes only helps them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if one is missing from the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't feel like putting on ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer, if it's available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can make it shrink or, in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against certain types of threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
The filters vary in effectiveness, and if you should have a problem, you might consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter parasites to which they were not accustomed in their place of origin.
Harmful animals can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that harm or kill people with force, are usually not classified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping represents the opportunity to buy tax-free goods and can be found in certain specific locations.
Travelers who come from countries with different taxes can sometimes save a good amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which frequently passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: significant slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are predominant.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - commonly 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and obeying these limits is even more important than in other circumstances.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than in other sections of the route, like in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakeries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are truly rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with cooked apples present in the dessert all year round, and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many German baked dishes have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often eaten with a shot of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the one that depending on the place is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a comprehensive term that includes a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, used without other adjectives, the term tends to mean the food originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a range of simple, flavorful dishes, with the main aromas that Javanese people love being garlic, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang low from both sides of the saddle.
They provide more stability to the rider but can present safety problems due to the potential for a rider to become trapped.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged away if the horse starts to run. To minimize this risk, a series of safety precautions must be taken.
As a first thing, most of the knights wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup to come off the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who falls.
The CochamÃ³ Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a great variety of granite walls and cliffs.
The climbs include breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes through its infinite wall potential.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiastic travelers, sometimes called "ski fanatics," who plan entire vacations to ski in a specific place.
The concept of skiing is very old - there are caves that depict skiers and date back to 5,000 BC!
Ski mountaineering as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski touring.
It is related but usually does not include ski mountaineering or alpinism, given that these latter two activities take place on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski itinerary as similar to a hiking itinerary.
With good conditions you could go faster than walking - but only rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through different countries would involve having to send many visa requests and having your passport checked in many instances.
The Schengen area, however, in this respect acts as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the borders without having your passport checked.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa to visit each Schengen member separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition of which handmade goods can be defined as antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, with the age limit potentially being lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products could be defined as antiques even if they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
The extraction of sand is an important means of sustenance for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding its trade is also important for other types of professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting and similar activities, keeping reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people do modern jobs. Tourism provides a significant income to Sapmi, the region of the Sami people.
Even though it is quite used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Singano" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel alert, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but this advice might only be aimed at their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The bulletins are only a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The facts they present are often quick, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or the loss of human lives.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, which can depend on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires are forms of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena can include thunderstorms, snowstorms, hailstorms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting the area they are traveling to, as this may alter their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Hostile environment course" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course normally covers all the issues that we discussed here in much greater detail, usually with examples of practical experience.
A course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications that deal with war zones are few.
Travelers who plan gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they bring valid documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender (x) or updated documents with preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of governments to accept these documents is equally variable.
Security checkpoint controls have become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people before the operation should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow returning from waves that break on the beach, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in certain deeper sections, and there a fast current towards the depths can form.
Most deaths occur as a result of the effort of trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you emerge from the current, going back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head towards places where it won't happen to you again or, depending on your abilities or whether you've been noticed or not, you might wait for a rescue.
Reverse culture shock arrives before culture shock (there's less of a "honeymoon phase"), it lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers for whom it was difficult to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When you return home after living away, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your old cultural habits.
When you travel for the first time, people are likely to be patient and understanding, given that they know travelers have to adapt to a new country.
People don't expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The light and sound show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for kids.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a ledger.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several states and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge with the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the peak of 4892 m of Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without cell service, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace your cell phone, seeing as to use the former you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make calls.
The service is often used for deliveries, including yachting, and shipments that have remote data and need voice communication.
Your local provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
A increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is popular especially among young people who have just finished school, which allows them to take a gap year before university without compromising their studies.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can improve your chances of obtaining higher education in your own country.
Typically, there is a fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a beautiful country for boats. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has many islands in its lakes and archipelagos along its coast.
In archipelagos and lagoons, a yacht isn't really necessary.
Even though the archipelagos off the coast and the larger lakes are big enough for yachts, a small boat or even a kayak is a completely different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
The same thing exists in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it's quite unique (in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Many of the typical Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historical center for a couple of days, returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you disembark through cruise excursions, you don't need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, in the brochures. As you can see from the map, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never traveled before or have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and the aversion to many things that everyone has.
For sure, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear based on the unknowns and not being in control.
Couriers are well paid for delivering goods quickly. Often time is really important for travel documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On certain routes, the bigger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent the goods by air transport, on certain routes it could have taken entire days to complete the unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to make it easier was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow sending baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a boatload of money for the privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for you).
Anyway, it's not economically sound: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times what you pay in economy for business class, and eleven for first class!
Generally, there's no reason to look for discounts on business class or first class on direct flights between A and B.
Airline companies know very well that there's a certain group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and in comfort, and they charge them accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member.
Economic channels have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
In Moldova, the most common religion is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second most important port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now only a modern, developed, and intense commercial center, arranged around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide avenues, buildings with glass windows, and modern shopping centers are punctuated by traditional roofs with red tiles, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, even though the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The small village of HaldarsvÃ­k offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the church garden, there are some interesting marble sculptures of doves on certain tombs.
Walking around the quaint little village for half an hour is worth it.
To the north, easily reachable, there is the romantic and seductive city of Sintra, made famous to foreigners after a sensational account of its splendors was written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple), a place famous throughout the world for the apparitions of the Madonna.
You are asked to remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, and also a site that has incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who spent time suffering there, and many more who saw their loved ones being killed or work to exhaustion there, both Jews and non-Jews.
You are asked to treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect that it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site with signs or scratches on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, and a vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only indicated in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
Regular announcements in the metro are only given in Catalan, but special notices are broadcast by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have the reputation of being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often a wrong stereotype, the best way to fit in in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like someone who is "well-behaved" (well raised). This will make getting your bearings relatively easy.
The Parisians' prejudices will quickly evaporate if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is largely wooded, mainly with beech and fir trees, and presents a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, diverse terrains, and varying altitude levels.
This area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
A rare fauna can be found, like the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the capercaillie, along with many other common species.
While visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who arrive without one, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Following the same line, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the entrance warehouse, but these clothes are not washed after every use, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing them. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple and popular supper, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and available toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and the objects.
Perhaps it also makes reading simpler, even if writing is a bit more complicated since you have to figure out if a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian because almost all the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are the c and the g, given that their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Remember also to pronounce the 'r' and 'rr' differently: in Venetian they are pronounced the same, but not in Italian.
Venetian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, leaving this grammar guide will help you learn a lot of things about Persian grammar and the understanding of expressions.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, you'll find it easy to learn Portuguese.
Anyway, people who know Spanish a little bit could quickly come to the conclusion that it's not necessary to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are usually obsolete today, and they remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution at its peak wasn't the only problem, they are often located in cities or university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
The majority of modern research telescopes are enormous structures in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, called "hanami", is a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were preferred.
In Japan, the first flower blossom festivals were held only by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to dig up "just one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formally laid out garden, removing "specimens" will ensure that you are expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and an easy place to get around, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But being in the tropics just a few degrees north of the Equator you will have to face the heat (always) and the sun that beats down (when the sky is clear, which is less often).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to base your vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or sailing along the Erie Canal.
I define itineraries also for popular cycling routes or hiking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the day of Jesus' birth.
Many of the traditions linked to the holiday have been adopted even by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are obviously Christian explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Many Christian churches often celebrate the Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, with congregations often coming in to celebrate at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals couldn't make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced: goats, horses, cows, mice, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, given that the sky is dark more or less all day.
Given that these areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners might expect.
The jacket and tie are the standard attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, and it emphasizes group effort rather than recognizing individual achievements.
The workers often have to obtain their superior's approval for every decision they make, and are expected to obey their superior's instructions without asking questions.
