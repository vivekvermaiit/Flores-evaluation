A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, had initially shown promise in the field, but formal studies indicated that it had fewer advantages than expected in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, which means that scientists used it as a reference and compared the three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of promoting a safe environment for all our athletes in the Olympic family.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than decertification.

This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but it also provides us with details that fossils generally cannot give, such as their colors and their three-dimensional arrangements.
The scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also gives a first glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur's feathers do not have a very developed structure, called a rachis, but instead have other feather features — barbules and barbs — researchers deduced that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than those other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not that of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, even if it's the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not downy feathers.
A car exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They found that the Sun functioned according to the same basic principles as the other stars: it was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was conditioned by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done was essentially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way likewise exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
During an interview, he stated that the new variant was "extremely worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have caught the virus in the hospital, thinks Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were healthcare workers at the hospital.
Over a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire group of people who have tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations from night to day indicate that there are probably caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as constant as in the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep pits in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the American Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelope was present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope was added except those of the electors duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

After Wednesday's competition, Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championships.
His first was the slalom, where he obtained a Did Not Finish in his first race. 36 of the 116 competitors obtained the same result in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who finished in first place and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers from the women's group failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are identified by the names Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She is being held awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be tainted by the fact that her image has been widely publicized.
It is a frequent practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks "journalists truly seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which generally deals with legal proceedings, has informed journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on those from before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that would have been discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requests a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters of the supplementary control trial of harmful populations had to be closely monitored by the guards, given that the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the framework of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage for the park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received complete safety instructions and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP).
It is the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures that will lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread demonstrations against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said he had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company has described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the Apple report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management stated that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the restrooms. Mendoza was brought down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he began to study premature labor in his free time.
Her research demonstrated that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung development of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
The wrestler colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. She is truly unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as troubled as I was... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she finds herself in a better place".
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who share this point of view in the poll want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of the people surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of them believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle categories and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his physical fitness has been questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain because it was prohibited by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using computer hardware and software from the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have possibly been the source of the water supply to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor at the beginning of the year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political blah blah and stupidity".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of an aircraft with greater precision and to give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is added and surface trains will not stop at Wembley and parking and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable on site.
The fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that he would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian islands of the Galápagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was thought that this process took longer, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked to make all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled very thinly into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn to become a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and embedded in another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the degree of acidity or alkalinity of the chemical product.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical product being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that had their electrons removed from them (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together, then, with clean, damp hands, press them into a ball.
The humidity on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give you a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had common wells with water in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of underfloor heating systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also latrines in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, latrines were sometimes a part of public bath houses where men and women were together in mixed company.
As soon as you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and then reflects it towards the Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel did for us is to give us a means of transport much easier and faster.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport brought us here.
Below them, there are felines of a more average size that eat prey of average size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including wandering domestic cats) that eat far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the "capeleta" concept, a special job that each cat has and that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three adult males from the same family, together with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely linked to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances, and do a pull-up with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a phrase of restrained and howling words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by their scent, tracking where they have passed on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as crossing a mountain range or a river, or moving to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and rivals, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will seem so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, expire).
Plants draw their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, and therefore had no fear of anything, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with more than 70 teeth as sharp as a razor, along with an extra row in the roof of his mouth, which meant there was no way to escape for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a powerful bite. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is possible that it was also a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex wouldn't have stood a chance against it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebratory items, which included boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that at the time, the poor and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, while rich men liked to have banquets together where they sprawled on their side while eating their meals.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a pumpkin.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the god's home.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built to be a part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters that faced the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no significant forests in the land of Canaan, and therefore wood was extremely expensive there.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But beyond his discovery, the Inuit tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, on the back.
Even though nobody knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its life, this large document and parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be kept.
So, it's likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings, and the subsequent battles, had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French of "Vichy." They were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American forces and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, a relative of the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means town or city-state, and which also defines in a certain way the dimension of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture implies the passage of knowledge across various generations, a persistent cultural weight, and an equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government—of which the Congress was its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its decisions.
He also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second team that has had the most success in the entire world, and they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world.
Because of the string/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often called, from a geographic point of view, an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the production practices of indigenous cereals and employing Chinese laborers to work in its rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal regions of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Around 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still photography worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, in a somewhat surprising way, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is greatly abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves a measure of order in an image.
He states that the most effective spot for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subjected to meticulous scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound the European states together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the peasant.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing dangers even to neutral ships.
Given the limited response to that tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of the war during the First World War, the nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his employer in his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing the different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that was in power represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also, between each dynasty, an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, a fierce war took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, to nationalism and to the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and brilliant to succeed.
It's the same for the military because instead of having army rankings based on class, they were now based on calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (the light) for contemplation.
The very cave, which survived time, gives a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Perched on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find, even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and members of his family.
The "high arc mark" looks like a V, and the "low arc mark" looks like a bracket or a square missing its bottom.
Up-bow means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down-bow means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A high bow usually produces a softer sound, while a low bow is stronger and more assertive.
You should feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were sent back from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a multitude of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and yelled threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to have the windows of their carriage completely open.
Suddenly, a member of the populace waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obligated to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to return the money for a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Certainly, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of Filipinos would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is usually known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the destiny of man is carried by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the very development of technology follows a path that goes largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a network of national roads is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, and therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new care techniques to repair bodily damage.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture linked to that geography appeared, and those, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was perceived as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century essentially because the crusaders returned carrying gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that moment that the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style had its peak during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major advances of that era is that as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is carried out to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system, using saved seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, many peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, class, place, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as being distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which may include a fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequent methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults during the time they were growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that feral children suffered severe violence or trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or running away.
Some others are supposedly been raised by animals; it is said that some lived in the wild alone.
When completely raised by non-human animals, the feral child manifests behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular adopting animal, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
Even though project-based learning should be the easiest and most interesting learning, the emphasis goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the Microsoft Office Clippy.
Virtual Scaffolding is built into the software and its function is to question, incite, and explain procedures that may have been too complex for the student to manipulate alone.
The children are placed in foster care for a significant variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We perceive the Foster Care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster families are supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of Internat lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" have also been identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting their microexpressions correctly.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who were unable to understand a speech due to brain damage were nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
I suggest further that such capacities of interpretation of human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two reserves of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation in both directions between the two gene pools at each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the plant resources available.
Moreover, not doing so has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins accessible in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, aphids, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide proteins in large quantities that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking yourself up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively discreet alarm to guide you towards consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself snoozing the alarm during your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking a lot of liquids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the end of the war, the confrontations of systems, processes, and culture led to a rupture between these countries.
After two years since the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already crumbling, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and products across the oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and its goods, while at the same time interfering with the ability of its enemy to move their people and their goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used U-boats, was trying to stop this circulation.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to have easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasture areas, often supervised by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the generally better-known shepherds. These pastoral methods are still used today.
Horse-powered railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though horse-drawn railways simply consisted of parallel wooden posts, they allowed horses to pull at higher speeds and haul heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realised that the tracks would be more effective if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found on Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living more respectfully towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also be activists in order to reduce the future suffering to some degree.
It is only like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we would need to find the root of the problems, and we should deactivate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become greater because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks further to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still revert to dinosaurs.
They are upright with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, if we use computer jargon.
It is possible that the internal poisoning is not immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
You must check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Bedbugs and assassin bugs are both nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or the dwelling of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the dominant neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.
Those couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it's not just that, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
The opinions of Aristotle were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external signals, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by labeling either the DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their workplace and they pass by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is, in one way or another, connected with, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why don't they function properly on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operations of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them escape their enemies more easily and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
That gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems obvious, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six kilometers wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that the planet's rivers pour into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were admiring of the monuments of their predecessors, which were much older than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the entire world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life for most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since Antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in their native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it was also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. You must not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It can also contain alloys that hold small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
And so, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
It's sad, but with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and fewer uses.
People now write messages on computers or on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus and force protons and neutrons together.
It's a bit like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again then releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with a small push or even less.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is finer under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
There can be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people choose or what is of interest to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them envy the things others do, and what things in their environment will make them do, or not do, certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One extreme of the spectrum is to try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, doing performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, another turns into an individual difficult to recognise, who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and appropriate it.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of their team.
This behavior very often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet across varying time zones that may not be understood by their local administration.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team establishes the norms for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals when one puts organizational learning concepts into practice.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and at the same time a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method that is used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to research on cognition. Therefore, it limits the area of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the scientists' research.
It has been known for some time that different types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes within our mind.
Even though artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning, and creating schedules, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have come from separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been built into various computer applications and home video games.
Field trips are an important part of all classes. Often a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours. Students can view artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also an excellent way to plan an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Given that students are often the most critical audience, the blogger is beginning to make considerable efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to nourish the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional school days.
The appropriate use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to internet material, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as highlight their own perspectives on particular topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and presents a fine array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
The Niagara Falls are located much further south, and the north is the region of the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered the quintessence of the Canadian experience for foreigners.
The vast expanses further north are rather sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness regions.
To make a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the territories, and it became established in a significant way in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began during the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their true marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they might consider harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You need to be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to defend your territory (cultural differences or not, this isn't normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Beida, and Spanish merchants who had established trading posts there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, earthenware, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east bordering Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Even though Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be assessed to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the least expensive mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the major stages during the special program "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has a more Arabic than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the emblematic symbol of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, preservation and entry fees must be paid daily for the park.
It can also be advantageous for someone to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the national parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider their main interest.
The parade of buildings that makes up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shining bar graph made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you need to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as if it were theirs, and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest continuous mangrove belt in the world, spanning 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast in the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps though – they include some of the last remaining patches of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Given that buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017 when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the center of other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
During the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the entire world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To get news about the tournaments and to know where to buy tickets for the polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands, and inside Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if British and American currencies may be taken; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Given that Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical regions; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are frequent.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the fauna is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
It's not important if they seem docile, bison, wapitis, moose, bears, and almost all beautiful animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Moreover, you need to be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, and therefore avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful demonstration in the town resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is located between two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch to Long Bay in the north and Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shady spots provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes very busy, that have a good range of shops lining the coast. Swimming there is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to choose from, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the concept of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an 'espresso', the cappuccino usually arrives piled high with cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reefs are made throughout the year, and accidents due to these causes on the reefs are rare.
Therefore, you must take the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear close to the beaches and near the river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of these times.
Lamias really exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most lamias are afraid of humans and would flee by swimming.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Reserving in advance gives peace of mind to the traveler, who will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, even though it may be possible for you to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights with the hotel.
They can also hold the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
All modifications or requests for this should be notified through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals decide to camp on site, and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get up early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have finished, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea from the North in winter, you need to check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice causes a noise quite awful for the most affected people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food and drinks and entertainment options to keep customers in a good mood and keep them on site.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on-site. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know that it's important to stay sober.
Those who are about to drive at high latitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is weak and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to immobilize you can fall in very little time.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or wind-blown snow, by condensation, or by ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, conditions under ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic flows almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and are the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari refers to overland journeys to observe the magnificent African fauna, in particular, the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to the vehicles, and standard equipment will allow them to be observed closely.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari", or going for a "jog") consists of walking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the competitions will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to be borrowed, even if there aren't any in the room.
If a hair straightener is not available, or if you don't really feel like wearing straightened socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
You need to be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, nasty burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places boiling water for a minute is enough, in others several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and in case of doubt, you should then consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar harmful animals in regions they are not native to.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force do not fall into the category of harmful causes.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and special duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep a cool head: steep slopes, narrow roads, and tight turns are common.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections—frequently 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Curiously, however, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other portions of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are very good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
The fruits in the pastry shop are common, with apples baked in cakes year-round, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes go particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but delicious pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the proportion of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used instead.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian gastronomy is a generic term that covers a vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used without another qualifier, the term tends to mean the food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors favored by the Javanese being peanuts, chilies, sugar (particularly coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can create safety concerns due to the potential for the rider's feet to get trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse flees. To minimize this risk, a good number of safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most of the riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, rather narrow sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to fall away from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The summits include impressive views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes there, amidst its infinite potential of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old — paintings in caves depicting skiers go back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
He is a relative, but he usually doesn't understand alpine skiing or mountaineering excursions, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
You should think of a ski tour like a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover relatively greater distances than walking – but you will only very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls many times.
The Schengen area, however, functions to some extent like a country in this case.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross the borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, and therefore you will save time, money, and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition has geographical variations, as the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products could be defined as old-fashioned, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of resources for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who have other professions.
And traditionally, not all Sami have participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, keeping reindeer mainly as animals for pulling.
Today, many Sami work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sami country.
Even though it is used commonly, particularly among non-Roma, the word "gitan" (gypsy) is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is the subject of travel advisories, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also wish to consult the advice of governments that are not your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Inclement weather is the generic term for all kinds of meteorological phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Inclement weather can appear anywhere in the world, and there are different kinds of it, which can depend on the geography, the topography, and the atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of inclement weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Violent regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all the risks of severe weather that may affect their area, as it may affect all their travel plans.
Those planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for 'courses for hostile environments' will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course should normally cover all the subjects discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last between 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aid elements, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in wild regions are common, but publications that deal with war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender not indicated (X) or updated documents to correspond to a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents simply varies everywhere.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the backflow of waves that break away from the beach, often at a reef or something nearby.
Due to the submarine topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deep sections, and a rapid current towards the deep waters can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim to shore against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be trapped again, or, depending on your abilities and if you have been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock arrives sooner than culture shock (there is less than a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who have had an easy time adapting to their new culture sometimes experience particularly difficult moments readjusting to their culture of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your original culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
It's possible that people don't anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Usually you hear the sound of tourists and vendors all the time. The story of the sounds and lights is simply like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception Island where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains melt into the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, including the Vinson Massif, which culminates at 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, and also expeditions that need data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
A increasingly popular option for those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel to learn.
It's something particularly popular with those who drop out of school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in studies abroad during a gap year can actually improve your chances of entering higher education once you return to your country of origin.
There will generally be tuition fees to enroll in those educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for all kinds of yachts, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This coincides with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic Cruises include a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historical city for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore as part of the ship's excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some cruises present Berlin, in Germany, within their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something we should be ashamed of: it's no different from the fears and personal aversions to other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not being able to control anything.
Delivery companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the major companies have their own planes, but for other routes and the smaller firms there was a problem.
If they had sent the goods by air freight, on some routes, it's possible that it would have taken days to go through the unloading stages and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as luggage in the suitcase. Airline regulations don't allow sending luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a good amount of money for that privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: generally speaking, you can expect to pay up to at least four times the normal price in economy class for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there's no point in looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from point A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are billed accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language there is Romanian, but Russian is widely used there.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member states of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Before the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy commercial operations center, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades, and the modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tile roofs, the 18th-century market, and the old mosques and churches, even though the city has more of a Mediterranean European ambiance than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting sculptures of marble doves on some of the tombs.
It's worth half an hour's walk in this strange village.
To the north and easily accessible is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which was made famous by foreigners after a passionate account of its splendors documented by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you should also visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), a place of Marian apparitions famous worldwide.
Please remember that you are primarily visiting a mass grave site and also a site that has an almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or who worked here until their death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make any jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the site by writing or drawing graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only indicated in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
Therefore, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to show your best behavior, acting like someone who is "well-behaved" (well-mannered). That will make it considerably easier for you to get by.
The Parisians' brusque exteriors will quickly evaporate if you show some basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mainly with beeches, spruces and firs, and presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and variable altitude levels.
The area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
It is possible to find a rare fauna there, such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the capercaillie, as well as many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are asked to wear skirts that cover the knees and to have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Following the same path, men were required to wear trousers that covered the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the reserve at the entrance, but that garment is not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (generally pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular supper, especially during the summer, is pa amb oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and all sorts of available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, together with the word "Sie" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and their objects.
Undoubtedly, it makes reading easier, even if the writing is a bit complicated due to the need to figure out whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to which attention must be paid are c and g, given that their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Consequently, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn many things about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It's useless to say that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Since light pollution at its peak was not the type of problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those that were built during the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Seeing the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so you must resist the temptation to uproot just "one" specimen.
If you visit a garden laid out in a formal way, picking some "specimens" will also get you banished, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to go and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to manage both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less frequent).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
You need to verify that the bus you intend to take goes to Hebron and not only to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or going on a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube, or boating on the Erie Canal.
They also define itineraries for popular walks and cycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christendom, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some exposed spot to see the sun rise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Many traditional churches often celebrate an Easter vigil on the Saturday night during Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the celebration as early as midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on the islands first arrived either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, given that the sky will be dark more or less continuously.
Given that the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The customs are standard work clothes and colleagues call each other by their last name or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing teamwork rather than praising individual performances.
Workers often have to obtain approval from their superiors for all the decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without any questioning.
