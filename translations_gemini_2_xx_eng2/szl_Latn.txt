USA Gymnastics supports the stance of the United States Olympic Committee and fully accepts the need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, can be better supported by continuing with legal changes in our organization, rather than revoking licenses.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely disseminated, but also shows peculiarities that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
They claimed that the fur of this animal was chestnut-brown on the top with a pale or carotenoid color underneath.
The finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but they have other feather features - barbs - researchers have concluded that the rachis was probably a later stage of evolution than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggested that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample represents the plumage of a mature creature, and not the down of a chick.
Researchers suggested that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature plumage and not down from a hatchling.
A car bomb detonated at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring over twenty other people.
The governor's office said that ninety of the injured are police officers.
Police said they suspect a supposed Daesh (ISIL) fighter is responsible for the attack.
They stated that the Sun works on the same principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to define the Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for was supposed to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts gravitational force on the Earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy exists in a halo and consists of many small particles.

Dr Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In the interview, he said that the new variant is "very contagious and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the bacteria in the hospital, and that two of them were healthcare workers.
In the course of one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
The percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people sick with tuberculosis still seems low; in South Africa, it is 6,000 out of 330,000 people infected at any given moment.

The director also promised about a million doses of a brain flu vaccine, which will help prepare health agencies for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to historically most affected areas have been postponed this year due to lack of funds and assigning them a low priority in relation to other diseases.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, based in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting traditionally takes place using advanced technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert into an envelope a printed paper card on which they mark their chosen candidate.
After the election committee verifies the identity of the person voting, they put the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter list.

Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to established procedures.

Four female skiers in the seated group did not finish their runs, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not finish the race.
Police from Madhya Pradesh recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chief Inspector of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were at home when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries, however.
The road where the accident happened has been temporarily closed, and the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, they moved him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been held in the Edinburgh sheriff's court, accused of murdering his son.
She is under arrest and awaiting indictment and trial, but all the evidence from eyewitnesses may not be credible because her image was widely publicized.
It is a common practice in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and courts see the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says that "journalists seem to be walking a tightrope when publishing photos of suspects, etc."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for prosecution, has signaled to journalists that there will be no further comment until the indictment is filed.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border conflict, which Palestine wants back based on the borders before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to such a presence for only five years.
The shooters who participated in the special pest control trial were to be completely supervised by guards, because the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program in cooperation with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, who serves as the director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in yesterday the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
That's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
In the last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the first CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at bringing the country closer to a new election.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime, which began in October.
Sometimes riots were caused by the lack of announcement of elections, which were supposed to take place since 2011.
Around 60 cases of abnormal iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
In the last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 extra overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delayed report "truly regrettable".
An earthquake started in the Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM Greenwich time on Friday).
The anti-crisis staff of the Northern Marianas said that no damage was recorded in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that nothing indicated a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman is holding Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were injured, and so far only six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place from the older woman because she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, in his free time, Liggins began researching premature births.
His research showed that administering the hormone accelerates the maturation of a child's genitals.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, or "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night of two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels confessed that "Luna was just as crazy as me... maybe even more so... I loved her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place".
Out of 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those who oppose the transformation of Australia into a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
On opposite poles, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his form is in question.
He wasn't able to take medications helpful for overcoming pain, because they are prohibited at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
A group of people verified the discovery using different equipment and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth along with organic matter, which can form proteins and help sustain life.
This may give us hope to understand how planets are formed, especially Earth, considering that comets crashed into Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office as governor at the beginning of this year and signed into law last month a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
I referred to these gossips as "political babbling and foolishness".
It is said that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow flights to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses technology based on satellites, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately track flights and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no extra transport, overground trains don't stop at Wembley, and parking lots and park-and-rides are unavailable above ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would take place behind closed doors without fans of the team.
Research results published on Thursday in the journal Science report the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species evolved in just two generations, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortis*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*, although previously it was thought that this process took much longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be twisted into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and can be glued onto other metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illustrated manuscripts".
It's a pH test. pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using juice from red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) a given chemical compound is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together, and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
Moisture on the skin will react with external layers, creating a pleasant sensation and forming a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the Minoan city houses of Crete and on Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women stayed in mixed company.
When you call someone far away, thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a signal and bounces it back to Earth, almost instantly.
A satellite was sent into space by a rocket. They also use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and view.
To launch satellites or telescopes into outer space, a gigantic rocket over 100 feet tall is necessary.
The wheel changed the world in an extraordinary way. The greatest thing the wheel did for us is that it gave us much easier and faster transport.
Thanks to it, we have trains, cars, and many other transportation machines.
Under them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and bats.
Indeed, there is a power of small cats (including domestic cats), which eat significantly more small victims, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, an extra task that each cat performs, and which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related, dominant males, together with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides function similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their victims.
As an all-around athlete, a tiger can climb (though not the best), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger does not resemble the full sound of a lion's roar, but rather a complex construction of raspy, articulated words.
Ocelots readily eat small animals. Whenever they can, they catch monkeys, lizards, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
It is believed that ocelots follow animals and find them (prey) by using their sense of smell; smelling the ground where these animals recently were.
Ocelots can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then attacking their victims.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originates (e.g., if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island, so that it cannot easily move back), it is often in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population, in order to be a strong competitor, will need different traits or adaptations than those it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to remember the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands, or even millions of years, both populations will look so different that it will no longer be possible to speak of them as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants obtain energy from sunlight through the process of photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and sew clothes from plants. Most of the food we consume is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the best predator of its time, it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 teeth as sharp as razor blades, as well as an extra set of teeth on the roof of the mouth, which meant that there was no chance of escape for anything that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it might have had a tongue in the form of a fork. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might have also been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that went into the water; even a big dinosaur like T. rex wouldn't have been able to handle it.
While most of their food is known to us, the Romans also ate strange and unusual things during festivals, including wild boar, dormice, snails, and a type of rodent called a fat dormouse.
The main difference was that while poor people (including women) ate their meals sitting on stools, rich men liked to have communal banquets where they reclined on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman firs could not have contained products that reached Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
Without examples, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open sacred space, as well as an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
In the past, there were extra towers built in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, which were part of temples.
At the top of the tower, there was an extraordinary sanctuary to a god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place in the fresh air.
Women were cooking in the square, the shops were just open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was unusually expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norwegian sagas, we read that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, tribes of Inuit people already lived there at that time.

If you watched the movie "National Treasure", you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written "Original Declaration of Independence from July 4, 1776". This text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
It is not known for sure who wrote it, but it is known that at the beginning of its existence, this large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ inches by 24 ½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
It is also likely that this inscription was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
They were rescued by the French from the Vichy State. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, which was later named Operation "Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the forces of Free France liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together - a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, related to the Latin "civis," which means "citizen," and "civitas," which means "city" or "city-state," and it also somehow defines the greatness of a society.
City-states are precursors to nations. Civilization-based culture ensures the transmission of knowledge across generations, maintains the cultural trail, and significantly develops it.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first created a weak central government – with Congress as its only element – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, the Congress relied on state authorities, which were often unwilling to cooperate and to enforce all of its acts.
He also did not have the power to repeal tax laws and customs tariffs between states.
Articles required unanimous consent of all estates to be changed, and the estates treated the central government so disrespectfully that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national team, is the second most decorated team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because Japan has a group of islands, it is often described, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa", which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in indigenous rice production practices and also employing Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, they declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what these buildings looked like before.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this renovation continues to this day.
For example, the most widespread still photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have become the format for image sensors in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, a bit misleading, as it's 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (without dividing by twelve to get a simple integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many popular formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
Often overused and also often ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple tip, the use of which creates dynamics while maintaining order in the image.
According to him, the most effective place for the main subject of the composition is the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
Without this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, also became an object of interest.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound European countries together despite differences in languages and customs.
This penetrating power influenced everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main rules of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that money from the church is specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle was observed.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off important military and civilian supply lines, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters in order to prevent all ships from entering entire ocean areas, which posed a threat even to neutral ships.
Because the reaction to this tactic was limited, the Germans expected a similar reaction to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism dominated among the majority of citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horror and cruelty of war during World War I, nations longed to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he took a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA to Thomas Edison with 4 cents in his account, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his first job).
Ancient China had a peculiar way of indicating different periods; each period or each family that was in power was a separate dynasty.
Between dynastic periods, there were also unstable eras of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, lasting 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, fierce wars were fought between powerful lords vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China; thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
There is a multitude of social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and qualified to achieve success.
The same applies to the army, because instead of military ranks based on class, now they are based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed representatives of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that were beyond earthly life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light), in order to contemplate.
This cave, which has survived to our times, provides a vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
It is located on the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find, even if you know of its existence. The center of the cave is completely isolated.
There's nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above us and the power of the mountains all around. Little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that has survived to this day.
Built without Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramids built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "bow up" sign looks like the letter V, and the "bow down" sign looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up top it means you should start at the tip and pull the bow, and down below it means you should start at the frog (from the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Bowing upwards usually generates a softer sound, while bowing downwards generates a stronger and more assertive sound.
Don't hesitate to add your own markings, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for the music, so they should usually be respected.
The deposed King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis Charles), as well as the king's sister, Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of women from the market to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
In the carriage, they were returning to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were roaring and shouting threats at the king and queen.
Then the people forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage wide.
At one point, one person from the crowd was waving the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The American imperialist war expenses for the conquest of the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay a tribute to the American colonial regime to cover a larger portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
Indeed, those huge profits originating from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos constituted the basic income from American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the order's creation.
The era in which these events took place is generally described as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that lasted in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (years 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which - according to convention - ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from those placing technology first, technologically imperative ones, to the strict assumption that human destiny is driven by a logic linked to the laws of science and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development follows a path independent of cultural or political influences, and that the effects of technology on society are hereditary rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the existence of cars leads to the development of roads.
However, state roads are not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increased occurrence of traffic accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques for treating damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, taken from such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with it arose, and these, because they were in harmony with their place in society, were better than arbitrarily introduced laws.
As a result, Paris was known as the capital of the modern world, and Constantinople as the capital of feudal Europe's fashion.
His reputation as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its importance diminished over twelve centuries, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with goods such as silk and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
That was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style's popularity occurred between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as in the 14th century.
Initially, the style of clothing was under a strong influence of Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of this time, which arose as a result of the Crusades, was buttoning clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming geared towards producing just enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, purely organic system that uses saved, native seeds for a given ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other similarly simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for their own needs, and this is still the case in developing countries.
Subcultures gather like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of members.
Features that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their belonging through the characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and vocabulary.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to refer to numerous unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their adolescence.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were imprisoned by people (usually by their own fathers); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was linked to the fathers' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Homeless children may have experienced significant abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned by their parents or running away from home.
Other than humans, animals lived here; it is said that some lived alone in the wilderness.
In the case of complete upbringing by animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to the behaviors of the animal that cared for it, such as its fear of people or indifference towards them.
While project-based learning should make education easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning itself, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals undergoing new educational experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be as virtual as it is real, in other words, a tutor is a form of scaffolding, just like the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and has the task of asking questions, advising, and clarifying procedures that might be too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for various reasons, from neglect and abuse to coercion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We see a temporary flight system behind the safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide safe homes, caring guardians, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster family is to provide all the necessary things that were missing in the home from which the children were previously taken.
The internet consists of elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Distinctive features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "long-term relationship" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the reactions of website users.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, movements of the face lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that, with proper interpretation of microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a given person is lying.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to a malfunctioning brain are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two pools of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move variations back and forth between two pools with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a leading tit (bird) with a digestive system like a human's to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant resources.
What's more, neglecting this has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest accessible plant resources would be proteins available in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
In contrast to us, for them, eating animals (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a large amount of protein, which contains all the necessary amino acids.
Taking all of this into consideration, it shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of repeatedly waking up during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you happen to reset the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before sleep, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the current life force. Every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of loving-kindness as well as many techniques from Indian yoga.
In its basic principles, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Yoga of the Deities. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. However, with the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to a split between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and was supposed to be fought for real, without proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization on the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army from the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, breaking the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is truly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional mission of the navy was to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time hindering your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable examples was the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, largely using U-boats, tried to impede this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered around clumps of trees or other pastures, often watched over by goat herders. Often these were children or teenagers, similar to the better-known shepherd. These rearing methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Despite the fact that wagon rails consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of those times.
Early on, wooden beams were embedded to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it became apparent that the rails would be more efficient if there was an iron bar on top of them.
This became a common practice, but iron caused a greater consumption of wooden wagon wheels.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, people began walking in an upright position two million years ago along with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk in an upright position so habitually.
Bipedal specializations occur in fossils from australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists, in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In the face of ailments, it's simply symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the source of the problems and eliminate it.
It is an obvious thing that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4, the engrossed copy, signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the print shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document took place on July 8th by John Nixon at Independence Hall Square.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who ordered it to be read to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap's broadsides that we know still exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe today that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that constantly remind us of dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet with claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Practically all computers used nowadays are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a reliable diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open cabinet with medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term "flat bugs" is used by entomologists as a formal designation for this group of insects.
This term comes from a distant relation to bedbugs, which are insects well-adapted to parasitizing humans.
Mites and bedbugs live in nests and are adapted to living in the nest or home of their host.
In the entire United States of America, there are around 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young to middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that only affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
It may be time to admit that raising a child is not in their best interest, nor in the interest of their child.
These parents can choose the creation of an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, biological fathers relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works, using the scientific method. This method in reality guides the majority of scientific research.
It's not just experimenting, but an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to answer questions and make observations, and also to conduct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
The views of Aristotle on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With a gradually diminishing understanding of Greek, the West has cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The strength of observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depends on the presence of endogenous drives and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not simply reactions to external periodic cues have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, that is, viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments by labeling either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the fragment of genetic material they affect, and whether the cells they affect are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire landscapes, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities in the field include hiking, fishing, photography, birdwatching, exploring parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and it's the nature of cooperation that when the majority benefits, there's always more to gain in the short term through selfish actions.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car to go to their workplaces, and they are passed by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the transport system based on private cars.
Science indicates currently that this mass carbon economy has torn the biosphere from one of its stable states, which supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears such a level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or maybe something more fundamental is happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, predicting traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a fairly consistent manner; because of this, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable degree of coherence and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics were established: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These dependencies help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their talent for flying helped them more easily avoid enemies and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back along their body.
It gives them a wider range of small places where they can hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many people believed something different; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries about 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes it is six miles wide.
The Amazon accounts for 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans.
The main river of the Amazon has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids lasted until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never equaled in terms of size and technical perfection of construction.
Ancient Egyptians from the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then roughly a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a common language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are of the Roman Catholic faith.
People knew about basic chemical elements - such as gold, silver, and copper - since antiquity, because they all can be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, claimed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were: earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled rather four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances, thereby creating what we see.
Alloys are actually a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. However, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Back then, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, along with the emergence of newer writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less frequent applications.
People now write messages on computer screens, without needing to get close to a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
A fission bomb works in such a way that energy is needed to assemble an atomic nucleus from the power of protons and neutrons.
I remember rolling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy again.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to decay with little or no external stimulus.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there may be more seas because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to flow to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized during their maturation into adulthood.
These theories analyze what it is about certain people that makes them want to do the things they do, and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of motivation are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can appear when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has problems with making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating work, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum is a person who transforms into an unrecognizable entity, who feels that they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
In virtual teams, the same standards of excellence apply as in conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often fulfill the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams, because their teams can meet in various time zones, which may be incomprehensible to local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an unusual component of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is a management team that everyone answers to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating an educational organization? One of the goals of applying the concept of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently utilized by all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process in which the organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to the creation of a new, innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
For an organization to be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies that the Continuum approach is a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They also narrow the field of study and make it more precise.
Correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports researchers in their investigations.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies will allow us to observe and investigate brain structures and processes in a way never seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes occurring in our system.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research into AI includes creating machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and creating schedules, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from clients, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and creations.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on delivering solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been incorporated into a number of home computer applications and video games.
Field trips are an important part of every class. Often, the principal would like to take his students to places where traveling by bus is not possible.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
A virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
Without this example, every year students from Bennet school in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state's capital city. Each year the website is redesigned, but old versions are stored online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. While students often begin their experiences with blogs with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Recognizing that students are often the most critical audience, the blog author is starting to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be more perceptive in relation to the world around them." The need to feed public interest inspires students to be perceptive and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is an activity that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can cause students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their position in the context of other people's texts, as well as outline their own point of view on individual issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a proud, bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
All these things and much more underline that Ontario is considered the quintessence of Canada by outsiders.
Vast areas located further north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The comparison of the population is surprising: There are more African Americans living in the USA than citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the wildest and is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was largely adopted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influences and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route, which led from Europe to India.
In the north, this region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every traveling woman states that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment, and it often happens that they are followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, don't make it okay!).
The present-day city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city after Dar al-Bayda, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, like tagines, ceramics, leather products, shishas, and a whole spectrum of gadgets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered a large part of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be checked to understand the conflict that is raging in the province of North Kivu.
This city is also a base for expeditions to the Nyiragongo volcano, along with one of the most endangered mountain gorilla families in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its perceived inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" became a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although it has an airport, and its markets make it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the list of world heritage objects in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
The city contrasts with the rest of the cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic than an African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological areas, each of which supports different fauna and flora.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily conservation fees and a park entrance fee apply.
It might also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to selected parks in South Africa or to all national parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is often called the Hong Kong territory and is a place that many tourists consider a major point of interest.
The parade of buildings that creates the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph, made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely distributed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that British colonizers claimed as their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest continuous mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. A part of the forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not only mangrove swamps, but also some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km², of which about one third is water/wetland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer living in this area.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because intercity buses are often full, it's good to buy a ticket with some advance notice.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. Spanning the Oyapock River, it connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of traffic with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully ready for use in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs control points is expected.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the territories of present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for their own needs.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with ancient groups of natives.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its traditional character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo and hockey teams in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be watched at other times of the year.
To get information about tournaments and where to buy polo game tickets, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; you should contact the owners in advance to find out what payment method is acceptable.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside the islands is practically impossible, therefore you should exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the perceived cold feel more severe than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain stays more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, they are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, as well as 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how docile they may look, bison, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that they attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval conflict in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
There are many beaches here because of the two harbours in Auckland. The most popular ones are in three regions.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with the possibility of safe swimming, and they also have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Almost all beaches are sandy, where you can swim safely, and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Sometimes crowded family beaches with a large selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
I dream of intimate, family-friendly beaches with a good selection of shops by the sea. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", it's not a complicated beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There's a power to French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be better.
Locally, tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water can easily be found if someone is afraid.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign. "Krōtko czorno" is "espresso", cappuccino contains a large amount of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Abel Tasman National Park is in the Nelson Bays region on the South Island of New Zealand, between Golden Bay and Tasman Bay.
Many excursions to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Despite this, one should listen to the advice of the authorities, adapt to all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish occur near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, they can be found outside of these periods.
Sharks exist, but rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Making a reservation in advance gives the traveler certainty that after arriving at the place, they will have somewhere to sleep.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may turn out that through the travel agency it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even packages that combine flight and hotel.
I can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
All changes or requests should first be reported to the travel agency, and not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a large majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most participants consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to leave early to get a spot at the campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages might have finished, there may be parts of the festival that will be playing until the late hours of the night.
Some festivals have extra Celtic areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, because traveling through ice causes terrible noise for the most sensitive people.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually make every effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
Usually, they have extra food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the establishment.
Some bars offer free alcoholic drinks at the expense of the company. Drunkenness impairs the talent for assessing the situation, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who intends to drive a car in high latitudes or across mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you can't drive like you're driving on smooth asphalt.
During a blizzard, a lot of snow can fall in a very short time, enough to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation of water vapor or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy roads are within the power of standards for countries, and road traffic usually takes place without hindrance throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in common usage refers to a land journey for viewing the captivating African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid, and it's better to watch them through binoculars.
Walking safaris (also known as "bush walks", "walking safaris" or "walking treks") consist of hiking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after having hosted the games in 1964.
People who booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the deadline extension may find themselves in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not cover July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is anticipated that the majority of tickets for the event will cost from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you are wearing unironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Pay attention so that the fabric doesn't heat up too much (which can cause it to shrink, and in extreme cases, scorch).
There are various ways of saving water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some regions, it is enough to boil the water for a minute, while in others, a few minutes are needed.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying water in a tightly sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in a worse case, cause allergic reactions, spread iodine, or transmit infections.
Certain infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force do not always qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods exempt from duties and excise taxes in specific locations.
Travelers who venture to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated forest terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, use common sense: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The imposed speed limits are clearly lower than on the previous and subsequent sections - around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than in other cases.
Interestingly, the mobile phone coverage is much better here than in many other sections of the route, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and diverse, similar to those of the southern neighbor, Austria.
Popular fruit baked goods include apples cooked in dough year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
For the power of German baking, almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts are also added. Popular cakes often go wonderfully with a cup of strong coffee.
If you have a youngster who likes small, but rich pastries, try these which, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with the addition of meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing the vast diversity of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if it is used without extra specifications, this term usually refers to firs originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a wealth of simple-to-prepare dishes, among which peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices dominate.
Stirrups are foot supports for a rider, hanging downwards on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can be dangerous due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged behind it if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, one can take a range of precautions.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a slippery, quite narrow, sole.
After that, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by the falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - the main climbing spot in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite big walls and towers.
From the peaks, breathtaking views unfold. Climbers from all parts of the world persistently forge new routes amidst the endless potential of the walls.
Downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending on snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main goals of travel, and many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", plan their entire vacation around skiing in a certain place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is associated with alpine skiing or alpinism, but usually not with the latter, which takes place in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than when walking - but you will very rarely be able to achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with a lot of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean the necessity of repeatedly going through visa procedures and passport controls.
The Schengen Zone functions in this respect somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for visas to each of the countries belonging to the Schengen area separately, which allows you to save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are antiques. Some auction houses define antiques as goods older than 100 years.
This definition varies geographically; the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be described as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture associated with this industry is also important to many people working in other professions.
However, even traditionally not all Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, largely treating reindeer as draught animals.
Today many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the region of the Sámi people.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate portrayals of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel advice, it may affect your health insurance while traveling or your travel cancellation insurance.
You can also use the advice of governments of countries other than your own, but their advice is intended for citizens of those countries.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may find themselves in a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
Statements are just a brief summary of the political situation in a given country.
The presented views are often superficial, general, and excessively simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather phenomena are a general term describing any dangerous weather event that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or fatalities.
Severe weather phenomena can occur anywhere in the world, and there are various types of them that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather phenomena, similar to storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
It is recommended that travelers be aware of the risk of serious weather events occurring in their area, as these may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that may be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for the phrase "Survival course in a hostile environment" will probably show addresses of local companies.
The course standardly includes all discussed agreements in a much more accurate way, usually with practical experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid activities, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Individuals planning gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they possess valid travel documents for their return journey.
The readiness of regional offices to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to reflect the requested name and gender is varied.
The readiness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as diverse.
In the period after September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints became much more invasive.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and personal dignity intact.
Fast-flowing currents are streams returning from waves that move away from the shore, often on a reef or similar area.
Due to underwater topology, backflow concentrates on a few deeper sections and can quickly form a rapid towards the deep water there.
Most drownings occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the rapids, swimming back won't be any harder than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted by someone, aim for a place where you can wait for backup.
Return shock comes faster than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more difficult.
Those who easily adapted to a new culture often find it very difficult to adapt to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some customs from your home culture.
Back then, if someone went abroad, people were more patient and understanding because they knew that travelers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed by travelers returning home.
The light and sound show on the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
Going to see the pyramids in the dark and going to see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear only the chatter of tourists and tour guides. The story of sound and light is like a book of tales.
The Sphinx is the background and the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and other pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and there are the most bases there - sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest of them is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Furthermore, Livingston Island and Deception Island are different, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The ridges of the Peninsula connect here with the plain, and then reappear, forming a 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, intersected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose peak is Mount Vinson at 4892 m high.
In remote places, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, because you need to be outside in a clear line of sight from the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is often used without shipping, including excursion ships, as well as expeditions that have remote needs in the area of data and voice transmission.
The local telephone service provider should be able to give more information about connecting to this service.
Increasingly, traveling and learning are becoming a popular option for people planning a gap year.
It is especially popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before starting studies, without prejudice to their education.
In light of circumstances, signing up for a gap year course abroad can truly increase your chances of undertaking higher studies in your homeland.
Usually, you have to pay tuition to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for sailing ships. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, on lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and on lakes you don't always need a yacht.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, smaller ships and also kayaks offer a different experience.
Swimming in ice water is a national pastime in Finland, with one ice hole for every seven or eight people.
This aligns with the results in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is entirely exceptional (e.g., in the Netherlands this number is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a longer stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historical city during the day and return to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore using shore excursions, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
On some cruises, brochures show Berlin in Germany. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not located close to the sea, and a visit to this city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a terrible experience for people of all ages and from various backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal anxieties and dislikes of other things that a lot of people have.
For some, understanding the principles of how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome the fear of the unknown or the lack of control over the situation.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of parcels. Often time is very important in the case of business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
In some sectors, larger companies have their own planes, but in other sectors and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If you shipped goods by air freight, on some routes transshipment and customs clearance could take a few days.
The only way to make the transfer faster was to check it as registered baggage. Airline rules don't allow passengers to check baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to cough up a hefty wad of cash for the privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
But that's not cheap: roughly speaking, you can expect to pay even four times more than the normal economy price for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Generally, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a specific narrow group of travelers who will gladly pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they plan accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations between these two parts of Moldova, economic contacts were re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good communication hub.

The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Around half prefer to speak Catalan, arguably the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are given only in Catalan, as it is recognized by law as the first official language.
However, the Spanish language is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the subway are given only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, unfriendly, and arrogant.
Although it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make getting around much easier.
Uncouth behavior from Parisians will quickly disappear if you use a few basic courtesies.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mostly with beeches, spruces, and firs, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
I especially appreciate the great diversity of plant communities, due to the variety of microclimates, diverse soils, and varying altitude levels.
This area is also home to unusually diverse species of animals and birds.
Rare species of fauna occur here, such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and hazel grouse, as well as many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts covering their knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide headscarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in light colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are obliged to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow it from the storage room at the entrance, but the overalls aren't washed after every user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these smocks. One size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like in similar regions of the Mediterranean Sea, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used for its preparation.
A simple, popular meal, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie" as in "you", always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It's an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
Certainly, this also improves reading, although writing is somewhat hampered by the necessity of examining whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation is quite easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters you need to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.
Remember also to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means expensive, while carro means chariot.
Persian has a fairly easy and mostly regular grammar.
Surely, here is the translation of the Silesian sentence to English: This grammar textbook will surely help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It's needless to add that if you know some Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can easily come to the conclusion that Portuguese is so close that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated today and serve as museums or educational venues.
Railway infrastructure, due to its destruction in the golden age, was not such a problem as it is today; it is usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than that built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous objects located in remote places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China, where plum blossoms were the most eagerly picked flower.
In Japan, the first celebrations for the occasion of cherry blossom were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy gathered around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to cut even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, you will also be thrown out without discussion for collecting "specimens".
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to get around, and after arriving you can buy almost anything.
However, when you are in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both the humidity (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There is also a bus schedule for buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a vacation on.
Without this example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, Rhine Valley, a boat trip to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also mark the routes of popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the day of Jesus' birth.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide.
The tradition is that on Easter night, you spend the night in some exposed spot to see the sunrise.
Indeed, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often organize the Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, and those gathered often begin the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on the islands earlier, got here by swimming, flying, or floating on water.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to travel, which is why the giant tortoise became the main animal grazing on the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, because the sky will be dark more or less all day.
Because these areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution often isn't a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are a standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or by first name using "du".
Crucially, harmony in the workplace is important, emphasizing collective effort more than praising individual achievements.
Employees often have to get approval from their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to unconditionally carry out the orders of their superiors.
