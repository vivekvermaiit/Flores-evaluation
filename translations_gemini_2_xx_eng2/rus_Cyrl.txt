This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that are usually impossible to obtain from fossil remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top and either pale or with carotenoid pigmentation underneath.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft called a rachis, but still possess other distinctive features—barbs and barbules—researchers have concluded that the rachis most likely appeared later through the evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. Researchers hypothesized that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample represents adult plumage, not chick fluff.
Researchers hypothesized that, despite this being the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen exhibits the plumage of a mature individual, rather than chick fluff.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded near the main police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: it was established that the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation, and nothing else.
The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic field reversals.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of a galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for may be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way affect the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way it interacts with ordinary matter.
According to this theory, a significant portion of the dark matter around the Galaxy is located in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

During research in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa, Dr. Tony Moll discovered tuberculosis with extremely high drug resistance (XDR-TB).
In the interview, he said that the new strain "causes very serious concerns, as it leads to a very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the infection in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people through close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis within the entire group of tuberculosis patients still appears low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected in South Africa at this particular moment.

Their thermal characteristics are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a near-constant temperature, but they are consistent with what are deep pits in the ground, according to Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Science Center and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally conducted using low-tech methods: the voter goes into a booth and places a pre-printed slip of paper, indicating their chosen candidate, into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, they deposit the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
French election laws quite strictly systematize the procedures.
From 1988 onwards, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no other envelopes are added to them except for the envelopes of those people who were allowed to participate in the voting and whose votes were properly counted.
Candidates may send their representatives to monitor the entire process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and according to a specific procedure.

In another race, this time in the giant slalom, she finished tenth among the women in the sitting position with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers in the women's sit-ski category failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants' names are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused were presented before the judges with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the building when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoye was subsequently charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, however, any testimony may be tainted, as her popularity has been extensively exploited by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists really do seem to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photographs and other data about suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, told reporters that no further comments would be made, at least until a guilty verdict is reached.
According to a leak, the document will concern the border dispute that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics reportedly touched upon include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to the preservation of such a presence for only five years.
The marksmen participating in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was being observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program as part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW).
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park and heritage conservation for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation have undergone comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) composed of nine members.
This is Martheyi's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the previous Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the mass protests against the government regime that began in October.
These protests, sometimes accompanied by violence, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were supposed to have taken place as far back as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod device overheating were reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four individuals.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 cases related to these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor, and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "minor."
In response, the ministry called Apple's delay in the report "very regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza was firing his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, but at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the elderly woman's place while she was away in the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating cases of premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that introducing the hormone will enhance the maturation of the child's lungs during fetal development.
Xinhua reports that state investigators discovered two flight recorders, or "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Here's what Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna became the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. That's such a unique event, just like she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "The Luna was just as crazy as I am... Maybe even crazier... Love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1400 people surveyed in the lead-up to the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign, expressed the opinion that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The survey revealed the following: 29 percent of respondents are sure that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness is now in doubt.
He couldn't take the medication needed to relieve the pain because it is banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
It was announced on Tuesday that, by the beginning of February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, as well as a source of organic substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a very long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his term as governor at the beginning of this year and signed the bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors "political babble and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration, will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
She is using satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
There's no extra transport running to Wembley, overground trains won't be stopping there, and there are no parking facilities or park-and-ride options available at ground level.
Fears about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game might have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday describes the emergence of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to the mating of the endemic Darwin's medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) with the immigrant large cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be formed into any shape. It can be rolled into very small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be woven and plated. It can be embossed or rolled into coils.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books – the so-called "illuminated manuscript".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical substance is.
The pH value is determined by the degree of saturation of the chemical compound under investigation with hydrogen ions (H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Obtain the new mixture by mixing the two dry powders in one container, and then use clean, damp hands to form a ball from this mixture.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, and then a shell-like formation will develop.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Surviving fragments of sewage systems have been discovered in Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was delivered to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and view to some extent.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has incredibly changed our world. The most important thing the wheel did for us was to give us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us a train, a car, and many other vehicles.
Below them are a larger number of medium-sized cats that eat small to medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, many small cats (including roaming house cats) eat and hunt much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the niche concept, the specific job each cat species performs, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related adult males, as well as females and cubs, the number of which can reach up to thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs—animals that have surprisingly similar habits to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Being a well-rounded athlete, a tiger can climb trees (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones with the ability to roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather resembles the shouting out of sentences made up of indistinct words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If the opportunity arises, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the small animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track animals and find prey by smell, using their sense of smell to follow their movements on the ground.
They can see perfectly in the dark with night vision and move almost imperceptibly. Ocelots stalk prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes compared to those it had before in order to become a strong contender.
The original population hasn't changed at all; it still requires the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it starts to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it will be impossible to say they are the same species.
We call this process speciation, that is, the emergence of new species. Speciation is an obligatory consequence and a crucial part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants feed on the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they cast shadows.
We build our houses and make our clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the most formidable predator of its time, so he feared no one except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and to top it off, there was an additional row on the palate, so there was no salvation for those who crossed his path.
It is not known for certain, but it is possible that his tongue was forked. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex would not have measured up to him.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans still had their own strange and unusual dishes served during feasts. For example, boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
There was another difference: while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy liked to organize communal feasts during which they ate reclining on their sides.
The diet of ancient Romans could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
Specifically, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main sanctuary to each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' desires during ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special towers in the shape of pyramids called "ziggurats" were constructed as elements of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house did not have particular significance.
Much of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas recount that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and, venturing further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, tribes of Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each of the countries was Nordic, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for easier storage.
Thus, it is quite likely that the entry was added simply as a note.
As a result of Operation Neptune and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not liberated.
He was under the control of "Vichy" French authorities. These Frenchmen had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just 2 weeks, the Free French forces and the Americans liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture, the bearers of which are a sufficiently large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning "civil" and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen," and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state," and it also expresses the size of a society in a certain way.
City-states are the precursors to nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a continuous cultural presence, and its sustainable dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind adequate historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government whose sole body was the Congress.
Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate and were unwilling to enforce all of its acts.
He also lacked the authority to repeal state tax laws and tariffs.
To amend it, according to the articles, unanimous approval of all states was required, but the states treated the central government so irresponsibly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of Italy from these regions participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
In Japan, there are approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to belonging to a cluster/group of islands, Japan is often called an archipelago from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan traces its origins back many years, to the 15th century, when European navigators sailing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded rights to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three primary structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the edge of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for static photographs is 35mm, and this was the dominant film size at the sunset of the analogue era.
Today it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sizes of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit misleading; it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a ratio with small integers) is therefore taken to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or closely approximate these proportions.
The often-used and sometimes ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in an image.
It states that it's best to place the main subject at the intersection of lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, found itself under close scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Her all-encompassing power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist precisely for this purpose.
The center of church authority was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to doubt whether this tenet was being observed.
Soon after the start of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy proved effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international laws as outlined in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was muted, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Among the majority of citizens and peoples in the 1920s, sentiments such as pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America and accepted an offer to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who had been his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, they used a unique method of marking periods of time; each stage of China's history, or each family in power, constituted a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between the reigns of each dynasty, fragmentation and instability reigned. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce military actions took place between many noblemen vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place on the throne in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many such social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a sole ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, work opportunities opened up to all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
The same applies to the army, because ranks began to be based on merit rather than origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics unrelated to worldly life. He often visited the cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
Well, the cave that has survived to this day vividly gives us an idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on a mountaintop north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to detect her, even for someone who knows of her existence. In the cave, a person finds themselves in complete isolation.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky overhead and the multitude of surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen and heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was erected by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The up bow sign looks like a V, and the down bow sign looks like a bracket or a square without its bottom side.
"Up" means that you should start at the tip and draw the bow forward, and "down" means that you should start where your hand holds the bow and draw it backward.
An up bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down bow produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can draw your own beaming, but remember that the beaming is printed for musical reasons and should usually be followed.
On October 6, 1789, an angry mob of market women forced the horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to throw the windows wide open.
At some point, someone in this crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the eyes of the frightened queen.
The Philippine people themselves paid for the American imperialism's military expenditures to conquer the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover the bulk of the expenses and interest on bond loans transferred on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking firms.
Of course, the super-profits brought by the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted them to create the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or the technological imperative to the strict view that the fates of people are driven by a fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is practically impervious to cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the "impact" of technologies on society is determined by their own properties, rather than by society.
For example, one could say that the automobile is a necessary cause for the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is only economically disadvantageous for a small group of vehicles, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in traffic accidents, which in turn drives the invention of new treatments for injuries in healthcare.
Romanticism largely incorporated cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture arose that, being in harmony with the place of residence of a given society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
His status declined throughout the twelfth century mainly because crusaders returned with gifts like silk and spices, valued more highly than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
It was at this moment that the title of Fashion Capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag behind by 25-30 years.
Distinct styles began to develop in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, farming system that uses seeds of plants native to the ecosystem, along with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods of increasing yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still observed in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel oppressed by societal standards and allow such people to define who they are.
Differences between subcultures can be due to the age, nationality, social status, place of residence, and/or gender of the people who make them up.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a particular subculture often declare their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to highlight several unfortunate cases where children, due to lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse, had no contact with adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral" or "wild." Some feral children have been isolated by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, such abandonment of a child was the result of parents not accepting their child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If a feral child is raised entirely by animals instead of humans, they will exhibit behaviors (within physical limitations) that are almost entirely similar to the specific animal that raised them—for example, their fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more engaging, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a form of assistance for those going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Clippy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding, which aids in learning, is built into the software and designed to remind, explain, and ask questions about procedures that the learner might find too difficult to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never grow up in an environment where upbringing, care, and education are not provided, but they do.
We consider the foster care system to be safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scale in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
Thus, the idea was expressed that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "long-term contact" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new facets of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting microexpressions — facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
In the article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks described how people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand speech can nevertheless correctly assess the speaker's sincerity.
According to his assumption, animals, for example, domestic dogs, may possess similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Studies conducted in the twentieth century demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations between two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, primates with a digestive system like that of humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are poorly absorbed by primates like us unless cooked.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking into account all of the above, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do to this day.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during regular sleep and falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other approaches based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present within you. Every person is potentially capable of attaining absolute peace and a sense of fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but was supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and numerous Indian yoga techniques.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) in Kundalini Yoga is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is considered the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is attained.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, disagreements regarding system, process, and culture led to discord between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was destined to last for the next 40 years. It was fought for real, using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places around the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete practically overnight when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after seizing eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and cargo across oceans.
The traditional job of sailors is to ensure the country's ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, primarily using its submarines, was trying to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain just as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for themselves in order to have milk, wool, meat, and hides readily available.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often overseen by goatherds, who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more common occupation of a shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although corduroy roads were simply parallel-laid timbers, they allowed horses to haul larger loads and at greater speeds than on the slightly bumpier roads of the time.
Railroad ties began to be used quite a long time ago to hold the rails in place. However, it later became clear that the tracks were more effective with a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
For their australopithecine ancestors, bipedalism was not as habitual.
Bipedal specializations are found in australopithecine remains from the period of 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living by taking more care of the environment. We can become members of the environmental movement and can even be activists to at least slightly alleviate further suffering.
As a rule, this is like treating the symptoms. If we need more than just a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly under the influence of humanity's scientific and technological progress, and due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyle, the problems have become more масштабные/large-scale.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight, 150–200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of this document was given by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who on July 9 ordered it to be read before his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 extant Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives on to this day. We call them birds.
They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and are able to fly.
But there's still much more to say about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly paws with claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today rely on processing information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" — or "bits" if you're using computer jargon.
Oral poisoning can be difficult to identify immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are too general for a quick diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for specific first-aid instructions in case of poisoning with this particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used formally by entomologists to refer to a group of insects.
This concept comes from the well-known bed bugs, insects perfectly adapted to parasitizing humans, known since ancient times.
Both predatory bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous species, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been identified in the USA, making multiple sclerosis a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that twice as many women suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take in the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world is structured by applying the scientific method. This method effectively underlies the majority of scientific research.
He is not, however, the only one. Scientific investigations are also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often heavily dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a reaction to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle autonomously for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into a bacterium using phages, i.e., viruses.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected segment of genetic material, and whether the cells that have undergone mutation are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who love to go out into nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of active recreation on the property include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this would be visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to commute to their jobs, while others drive past them, headed to workplaces in the very places they just left.
In this active traffic movement, everyone is connected to and supports the personal car-based transportation system in one way or another.
Currently, science indicates that the vast hydrocarbon economy has impacted one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of humanity for the past two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Virtually everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of traffic flow involves analyzing the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior is often systematic enough; thus, traffic flows as a whole possess some regularity and can be approximately described mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between three fundamental quantities: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily, find food, and find mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This provides them with more secluded spots in which to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Many believed he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching a width of six miles.
A full 20 percent of all the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although pyramid construction from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed.
In the New Kingdom, ancient Egyptians admired the monuments created by their predecessors over a thousand years ago.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
In Vatican City, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also suggested that they transition into a new state to create what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It is also possible to create alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it appeared.
It's sad that with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil lost its former status and became less used.
Nowadays, people type messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard with the advent of newer technologies.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to keep many protons and neutrons together in one nucleus.
It's roughly like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then, the repeated splitting of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they are prone to decay with little or no external influence.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick under the oceans and 100 km thick under the continents.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates people to act or what might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate internally during the process of growing up.
These theories address what makes specific people want to do what they do, and what in their environment encourages or discourages them from doing certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation.
As a rule, two types of behavior can manifest when managers begin to lead people who were previously equal to them in status. One extreme of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
It is difficult for such managers to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary measures, evaluate work results, delegate responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has done and take credit for it.
After all, a leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, because their teams may meet across different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is a team of managers to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization go through the laborious process of creating a self-learning organization? One of the goals of applying self-learning organization concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
Ultimately, the organization's cohesive work aimed at overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that meets the client's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and experience accumulation.
Angel (2006) explains the "Continuum" approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of effectiveness.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness. This narrows the scope of research, making it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of damage, trauma, lesions, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a large amount of data and materials for creating simulation models that help us understand the processes occurring in our consciousness.
Despite being strongly associated with science fiction, AI is a very important field of computer science that considers the behavior and learning of machines and the "implantation" of intelligence into them.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples that can be given: control, planning and scheduling, responding to client diagnoses and questions, as well as facial, handwriting, and voice recognition.
Such questions are выделены into separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve the problems we face in everyday life.
Currently, AI systems are frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being integrated into some software applications for home computers and video games.
Educational excursions are very important for any class. Very often teachers want to take their students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can examine museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their class.
Putting a tour into a virtual space for public viewing is also a great way to refresh the tour in your memory and share your acquired knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and each year this website is updated, but access to the old versions is still maintained—they serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogs using sloppy grammar and spelling, this generally changes due to the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "helps students better understand the world around them." Students are inspired to be smart and interesting, attracting the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to extend the knowledge acquisition process far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online materials, students can define their position in the context of others' work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada with a vast number of art galleries and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while the north is the domain of the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and surrounding areas.
All this and much more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are practically uninhabited wilderness.
An amazing population comparison: the US has more African Americans than Canada has citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than others and is a distinctive continent when it comes to wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this region, which became particularly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
For women: all female tourists are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that, due to cultural differences, they may feel harassed when they are often pursued, grabbed by the hand, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city called Ed-Dar-el-Beida, and Spanish traders, who established trading posts there, named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole assortment of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a relatively safe place, it is advisable to check in advance regarding any travel outside of Goma to understand the state of the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and you can see mountain gorillas in the wild here at one of the most affordable prices in Africa.
You can travel to Goma by boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The typical (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for an exotic, faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat from desert sands.
During the filming of Henry Louis Gates' PBS program "Africa's Great Civilizations," one of the most important stops was made here.
This city differs significantly from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by an Arab flavor, rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River serves as its southern border.
The park's area is 19,500 km²; it contains 14 distinct ecozones, each of which is a habitat for different wild animals.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a leader among South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for the conservation and visitation of this park.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit South African national parks either selectively or all of them.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after Hong Kong Island, a place that many tourists consider to be the main focus of their attention.
The string of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline is compared to a sparkling bar graph, underscored by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most picturesque places in Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the Kowloon Peninsula coastline, which is located opposite.
The majority of urban development in Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place that British colonizers seized for themselves, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest that stretches inland for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps—they also encompass some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 square kilometers, of which approximately one-third is covered by water or swamps.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that it currently houses 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
Marshrutka is a fast and convenient way to reach nearby places like Paro (150 Ngultrums) and Punakha (200 Ngultrums).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapok River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes of traffic, each 3.5 meters wide.
The underbridge clearance is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area that is now eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to various groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "immense province of the West Indies," emerged as a result of the clash between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its distinctive character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and the best players in the world in the sport of polo.
The year's largest tournament takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at other times of the year.
To find news about polo matches and where to buy tickets for them, visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. Credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, although British and American currency may be; clarify in advance with the owners which payment method is acceptable.
Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, air temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather than what the thermometer shows.
There aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons here: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the area is still a wilderness, so you should not feed or disturb the animals.
The park administration warns: do not approach bears and wolves closer than 100 yards/meters, and all other wild animals closer than 25 yards/meters!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, moose, bears, and practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their personal space.
Additionally, remember that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying fragrant food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships sank, with the exception of one British cruiser. About 200 American and German sailors died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here because Auckland is located on the shores of two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shady thanks to trees like the pōhutukawa.
In Auckland's central district, where the Waitematā Harbour hosts the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, lie the beaches of Tamaki Drive.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The most popular local beer is "Number One," which has a simple, pleasant, and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that one can drink, however, New Zealand and Australian wines may transport better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're still concerned, bottled water is readily available.
Australians don't understand the idea of a "flat white". A "short black" is an espresso, they serve cappuccino with a tall layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although the fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
The reef sees a large number of trips year-round, and injuries resulting from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. They can sometimes be found outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their primary habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking allows travelers to avoid worrying about where to spend the night upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping sites.
Travel agents typically sell package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages including flights and hotel accommodations.
Furthermore, they can hold your booking if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees camp directly on the festival grounds, and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the stage, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have already ended, there might be areas at the festival where they will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, inquire about the cabin's location, as navigating through ice creates quite a frightening noise that can disturb the sleep of the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (clarify conditions).
Casinos typically make every effort to ensure that visitors spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible in the establishment. There are no windows or clocks there, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and prevent them from leaving the premises.
Some establishments offer free alcohol. However, intoxication clouds judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone planning to travel through high-latitude regions or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On an icy and snowy road, friction is low, and you won't be able to drive the same way as on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to get you stuck can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited due to snowfall, blizzard, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy weather conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues year-round with almost no interruptions.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist draw in Africa and a highlight for many travelers.
In everyday use, the term "safari" refers to a land-based trip with the purpose of viewing Africa's remarkable wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach cars, so you can get a good view even with regular equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you'll see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "foot safari") consists of a hike lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice. They were first held here in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the date postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related policies do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron handy or you're not thrilled with the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to excessively high temperatures (as this may cause shrinkage or, in very rare cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, while others require several minutes.
Filters have varying degrees of effectiveness, and if in doubt, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that they have not seen in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, even worse, trigger allergic reactions, secrete venom, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of causing injury or death to humans, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods without taxes and excise duties at specific locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated, remote, and wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be alert: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The speed limits in place are significantly lower than on the preceding and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than elsewhere.
However, oddly enough, the cell phone service here is much better than on many other parts of the route, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German confectionery baking is quite good. In Bavaria, it is very abundant and diverse and resembles the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, apple pastries are available year-round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts are often used in German baking. Popular cakes often pair perfectly with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but filling flour-based pastries, try what is called either olad'yi or filled donuts, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In inland Pakistan and North India, yogurt is actively used in curry. In South India and certain regions on the coast of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a blanket term used to refer to the vast array of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without clarification, this term most often implies food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, widely available throughout the archipelago today, includes an assortment of simply seasoned dishes. Javanese people have a strong preference for flavor enhancers such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet, hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety concerns as there is a possibility of the leg getting stuck.
If a horse throws its rider but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, the running horse can drag him along. A number of precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly thin sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, are equipped with safety bars that allow the leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley is a major climbing destination in Chile. It's known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of big granite walls and cliffs.
At the top, you can enjoy stunning mountain scenery. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its vast potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snowy terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
For many ski enthusiasts (sometimes jokingly called "ski bums"), alpine skiing is the primary tourist destination, with their vacations planned entirely around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock carvings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related, but it doesn't usually involve hiking to the summit and then descending on unprepared slopes, as backcountry skiing requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route is a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover somewhat greater distances than on foot, but you'll only be able to achieve such speeds on cross-country skis in very rare circumstances, when you don't have a heavy backpack and there's a groomed track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for visas and go through passport control multiple times.
But the Schengen Area functions as a single country in this regard.
When in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen Agreement member countries separately, which will save you time and money, as well as avoid paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of which manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are 100 years old or older as antiques.
This concept has geographical variations, where the age threshold in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger in age than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important for many other professions.
Although it is the tradition, not all members of the Sami people engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; they lived by fishing, hunting, and other similar trades, using reindeer primarily as pack animals.
Today, many Sami are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are planning to visit is subject to travel advisories warning against visiting, this may affect your travel medical insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult with other governments besides your own, but their recommendations are geared toward their own citizens.
Here's one example: U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face situations that Europeans or Arabs may not.
The news reports only briefly described the political situation in one country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, vague, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information that is readily available.
Adverse weather conditions are a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Adverse weather conditions occur everywhere around the world, and they come in various forms that depend on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and forest fires are manifestations and effects of severe weather phenomena such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to consider any risks associated with severe weather in their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Everyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for the phrase "hostile environment awareness training" might return the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the topics touched upon here in much greater detail, often with hands-on training.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing scenarios, a large amount of information on first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about war zones are few.
People planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender marker (X) or documents updated to reflect a preferred name and gender varies from place to place.
The willingness of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations under these documents varies greatly.
Screenings at checkpoints also became much more thorough after the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people preparing for surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
A rip current is a current created by waves breaking on the shore, or sometimes on a reef or something similar.
Backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, where a fast current can form, descending to a great depth due to the underwater topography.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion when trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back will be no harder than usual.
Try going somewhere they won't catch you again, or, depending on your skills and whether you were noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock hits harder and faster than culture shock (which has a shorter, more romantic period), lasts longer, and can be more difficult.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding with you, knowing that travelers need to adapt in a new country.
It may be surprising to people that patience and understanding also need to be shown to travelers who have returned home.
The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most interesting activities in this area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can also see them in the silence before the show begins.
Usually, the noise from tourists and vendors is always audible. The sound and light show is like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as both a backdrop and a narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819. These islands have the highest concentration of research bases, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named King George and contains the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano forms an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of this peninsula merge with a plateau, and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains range, divided into two parts by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, specifically on the Sentinel Range, are located the highest mountains of Antarctica – the Vinson Massif, whose highest point reaches 4892 m and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote locations with no mobile network coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
As a rule, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, since you need to be outdoors in direct line of sight with a satellite in order to make a call.
The service is frequently used in shipping, including pleasure craft and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data transmission and voice communication.
As a rule, you can get more information about connecting this service by contacting your local telephone operator.
A increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before entering university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can indeed increase your chances of getting into higher education institutions back home.
As a rule, tuition fees apply for enrollment in such educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating tourism. In the "land of a thousand lakes," there are also thousands of islands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
Exploring archipelagos or visiting lakes, you can вполне manage without a yacht.
While coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks provide a completely different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland. Specifically, there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand have a similar situation, but in other cases, it's quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, this value ranges from one to forty).
Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend several full days in this historic city and return to the ship to sleep.
If you only go ashore as part of a ship excursion, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be daunting for a person of any age and social status, especially if it is their first flight or if they have had any traumatic experience in the past.
There's no need to be ashamed of it: it's no different from personal dislike and fear of other things that many people experience.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that arises from the unknown or the inability to control the process.
Delivery services are well paid for fast delivery. Often, the speed of delivery of commercial documentation, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
Some larger companies have their own aircraft on certain routes, but this has been a problem for other routes and smaller companies.
If they were to ship anything as air cargo, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to deal with him faster is to send him as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow sending baggage without a passenger, so your participation is needed here.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to cough up the money for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to pay for you).
However, it's not cheap at all – based on experience, you'll pay roughly four times the standard economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
As a rule, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a hefty sum for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and that is why they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has fallen victim to ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, situated along a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and is also home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the church cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some of the graves.
It's worth taking half an hour to walk around the unusual village.
Comparatively not far, to the north, lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, praised by Lord Byron and subsequently known throughout the world.
Scotturb bus number 403 has regular routes to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, also visit the grand Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (tomb), a site of world-renowned apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are, in principle, standing on the site of a mass grave, as well as a place that is indescribably important to a significant percentage of the inhabitants of the globe.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, but there are even more people whose loved ones were killed here or worked here to death, whether they were Jews or people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not defile this place by applying or scratching graffiti on surrounding objects.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other public spaces.
Regular announcements in the subway are only made in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it's often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave in the best possible way, like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will significantly ease your adaptation to the city.
The Parisians' unwelcoming exterior will immediately vanish if you show a little basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily overgrown with forest, mainly beech, spruce, and fir trees, and represents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a combination of microclimates, diverse soils, and variations in altitude, it features a particularly wide variety of plant communities.
The area abounds with a huge variety of animal and bird species.
Here you can find rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and wood grouse, as well as many other common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women should wear skirts below the knee and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide robes for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with a bright color, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also take them at the entrance, however, these skirts aren't washed after every use, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing them. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on vegetables, bread, and meat (especially pork), with the widespread use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish for lunch, especially in the summertime, is Pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available topping, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, meaning "you" (formal), are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is important to distinguish between verbs and objects.
This also likely simplifies reading, while writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You should be especially careful with the letters 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.

Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this Persian grammar textbook will help you learn a lot of new things and better understand expressions.
It's obvious that if you know a language from the Romance subgroup, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough and doesn't need to be learned separately.
Ancient observatories are generally considered obsolete today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem during their heyday as it is today, they are typically located in cities or on campuses that are easier to reach than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Sakura blossom viewing, known as "hanami," became part of Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
This idea came from China, where the plum blossom was a favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing celebrations were arranged by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural habitat, so don't give in to the temptation to take even a single specimen.
Visiting an officially organized garden and collecting "samples" there will also get you kicked out without a word.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, easy to navigate, and almost everything can be bought after arrival.
However, finding yourself in the "deep tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both the heat (constantly) and the intense sun (more rarely, under a cloudless sky).
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron—the legendary burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their wives.
Make sure the bus you are about to board is going to Hebron, and not just the nearby Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good theme for some kind of celebration.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, taking a sightseeing cruise on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also designate routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by those not belonging to Christianity around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night without going to sleep, in some open place, in order to see the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter services on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with parishioners typically beginning the celebration of Christ's Resurrection at midnight.
All animals that originally arrived on these islands got here by swimming, flying, or being carried by the current.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to reach there, which makes the giant tortoise the primary herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights because the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and as a result, light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Workplace harmony is extremely important, and group work results are valued more than individual achievements.
