While an experimental vaccine appears promising in reducing the mortality rate of Ebola, to date, no drug has been clearly proven suitable for treating this infectious disease.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promising results in experiments, but formal studies revealed that it offered less benefit than expected in terms of preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the standard of comparison, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments against it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and embraces the Olympic family's absolute requirement to develop a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our clubs and athletes, as well as their sport, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than withdrawing and rejecting it.

This not only confirms a widely known hypothesis that at least some dinosaur species had feathers, but also provides details that fossils cannot reveal, such as color or three-dimensional structure.
Scientists believe that this species has chestnut-brown plumage on the upperparts and blue-gray or yellow/orange on the underparts.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed rachis, called a calamus, but possessed other feather characteristics - barbs and barbules - researchers suggest that the calamus may have been a later evolutionary development, arising after these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that this plumage was not used for flight, but rather for regulating body temperature or for display. The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen exhibits mature plumage rather than downy feathers.
Researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of a mature bird and not the feathers of a chicken.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

They discovered that the Sun operates according to the same fundamental principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in this system is concluded to be driven by self-illumination, self-rotation around their axis, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are both used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less stellar activity related to magnetic field reversal.

The work completed is mainly theoretical, but the program is written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for will be created by the tidal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts gravitational force on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in a way similar to the properties of ordinary matter.
This theory posits that the majority of dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

In France, voting has long been a low-tech affair: each voter enters a private booth and places a pre-printed ballot with the name of their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the staff verifies the voter's identity, the voter will place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the electoral roll.
French electoral law is quite strict in systematizing procedural processes.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes were present at the start of voting and that no envelopes were added except those of legitimate and permitted voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe the entire process. In the evening, ballots will be counted by volunteers under close supervision, following a specific procedure.

Her other race, in the Giant Slalom, saw her finish in 10th place in the women's standings with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place finisher Claudia Loesch of Australia and 1:09.02 minutes behind 9th-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers did not finish the race, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom event failed to place in the rankings.
Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested the five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The suspects who were prosecuted are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commander Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver survived despite suffering severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently convicted in Edinburgh Sheriff Court of the murder of her son.
She is currently in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but all witness evidence may be compromised because her image has been widely publicized.
This practice is very common in England, but Scotland is different, where the law and courts have found that disseminating images could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "perhaps journalists are really treading a dangerous path when publicizing images, etc., of suspects."
The prosecuting authority, responsible for overall prosecution, informed reporters that there would be no comment until indictment at the earliest.
The documents, according to the leak, will mention border conflicts, which Palestine wants to base on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of the holy city of Jerusalem for both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded the continued presence of troops in the valley for ten years once the agreement was signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agreed to a five-year presence.
The hunters in the supplemental pest control trial program were closely monitored by forestry staff because that trial program was supervised and its effectiveness evaluated.
Under a cooperation agreement between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, eligible volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's personnel search program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of the NPWS Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the initial cull were given comprehensive training and guidance on safety principles.
Martelly was sworn in before the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council established by Martelly in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) resign. This recommendation was part of a package of measures aimed at transitioning the country to new elections.
This order is Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests since October.
These sometimes violent protests stem from failed election organization, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
According to reports, there have been approximately 60 cases of iPod portable music players overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burn injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it is aware of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported to them an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
In response to the announcement, the ministry called Apple's report postponement "extremely regrettable."
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT, Friday).
The Northern Marianas' Office of Emergency Management says there have been no reports of damage in the CNMI.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took several tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking the bus they were riding in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Like their Filipino counterparts, six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early.
Later photographers took the place of the elderly woman when she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained in obstetrics and gynecology and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During his time working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature birth in his spare time.
His research shows that if injected with a certain hormone, the rate of fetal lung development will be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the plane's two 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also expressed their gratitude to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the First Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as scary as me...maybe even more so...I loved her and will miss her...I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the poll, 29% of participants believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is expected to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but according to his complaints, his fitness is not guaranteed.
He can't use painkillers because those types of medications are banned in the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper was a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri who discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
The discovery was verified by some people using different hardware and software in early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have once been a source of water for Earth, along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth in ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, began serving as governor at the beginning of this year. Last month, he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called these rumors "political chatter and lunacy."
There were rumors that he would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to ground-based radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and providing pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be deployed, and surface-level trains will not stop at Wembley, and there will be no parking lots or park-and-ride facilities in the area.
Concerns about lack of transportation raise the possibility that the match will be forced to be played behind closed doors without fans of this team.
A study was published in the journal Science on Thursday about the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
According to a report by researchers at Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, new species evolved in just two generations, even though this process was thought to take much longer, due to interbreeding between Darwin's finches, genus Geospiza, and migratory Geospiza birds.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be crafted into very small objects.
It can be drawn into thin fibers for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be hammered very thin and plated onto other metals. It can be hammered so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH level of a chemical. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of the chemical.
pH is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the experimental chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Twist the two dry clumps of dough together, then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex drainage system.
Remnants of wastewater systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women used them together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and then bounce it back down, almost instantaneously.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images we observe.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has brought to life is that it helps us travel and transport things much easier and faster.
It brings us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
At a lower level are medium-sized species of the cat family, preying on medium-sized animals from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cat species (including domestic cats) eat large numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is niche specialization, a unique job each cat has to avoid competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the cat species, living in large groups called prides.
The group consists of one to three related adult males, along with about thirty females and their young.
Women often have close relationships with each other in a family with many sisters and daughters.
Lions behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Like an all-around athlete, tigers can climb (though not very well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
Tigers belong to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger isn't like the roar of a lion, but more like a series of guttural growls in the throat.
Ocelots eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if possible. Most of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that South American wildcats track and find animals to prey on by scent, sniffing every spot where the prey has stood.
They can see very clearly in the dark with their night vision and move skillfully, unnoticed. Wild cats hunt prey by camouflaging themselves in their surroundings, then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small number) separates from the main population (such as when they move across a mountain range or a river, or to a distant island where it is difficult for them to return), this group of organisms will often perceive that they are in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than they were before.
The initial population remained completely unchanged; they still needed adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new group of inhabitants began to adapt to the new environment, they started to look increasingly less like other population groups.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence and extremely important for evolution.
Trees produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathing out).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of our food comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was an apex predator during its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its elongated jaw holds over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with a secondary set of teeth on the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing can escape its path.
We don't know for sure, but it might have a forked tongue. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even be a cannibal.
It also attacked everything in the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex were no match for it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans indulged in exotic or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women sat on chairs to eat, the wealthy preferred to hold feasts together and recline leisurely to eat.
Meals in ancient Rome did not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god and considered it to be the home of that god.
People would bring offerings to present to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has a courtyard area outside, and inside is the sanctuary that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes, towers with a distinctive pyramid shape, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Given the warm climate of the Middle East, housing is not as important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their time living in open spaces.
Women are cooking in the yard; newly opened shops overlook the street. Stone is used to build houses.
There are no large forests in the Canaan region, so wood is very expensive here.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norse mythology tells that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west he discovered Greenland and named the land Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although they are all 'Scandinavian' countries, there are still many differences in people, royalty, customs, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence drafted on July 4, 1776." This inscription appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the author of the document is uncertain, it is known that in the early days, the document, written on a large piece of parchment (29¾ inches long and 24½ inches wide), was rolled up for preservation.
So, it's possible that the annotations being added are simply labels.
The Allied landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unfree.
This area was ruled by the French "Vichy" government. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces launched "Operation Dragoon", invading the south of France.
In just two weeks, US and Free French forces liberated Southern France and then turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a prominent culture shared by a large group of people living and working collectively in a society.
The word "civilization" originates from "civilis" in Latin, meaning "belonging to the people," related to "civis" in Latin, meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city or city-state," and it also partly defines the scale of society.
The city-state was the precursor to nations. The culture of civilization embodies the transmission of knowledge through generations, a cultural imprint that remains and is well-disseminated.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving behind concrete historical evidence and are not recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies initially formed a weak central government - with only the Continental Congress as its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and lacking a national executive or judiciary, it was forced to rely on the authority of the states, which were often uncooperative, to enforce its decisions.
It also does not have the authority to amend tariff laws or schedules between states.
The articles of confederation required unanimous consent from all states before amendments could be made, and the states disregarded the central government to the point that state representatives were frequently absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international arenas and Olympic events.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), Japan is the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the presence of island clusters/groups, Japan is also often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's history can be traced back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in the local people's grain farming practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice paddies and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty's army (1644-1912) controlled the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Dynasty.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the complex have been reconstructed to help visitors better visualize their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most popular still photography format in the world is 35mm, the prevalent film size before the end of the analog film era.
It is still in production to this day, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is somewhat confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio for this format (dividing by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format files) are equivalent to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often mocked and overused, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while still serving as a measure of order in a photograph.
According to this rule, the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
Throughout this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had by this time become wealthy and powerful, began to come under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has become a unifying thread among European nations, despite the differences in language and customs.
Its absolute power affected everyone, from royalty to commoners.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds donated to the church exist for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money makes many wonder whether the aforementioned doctrine is being followed.
After the outbreak of hostilities, Britain immediately deployed a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proven effective by cutting off military and civilian supply lines, although this blockade violated widely accepted international law, codified by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
He deployed naval mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean area, endangering even neutral vessels.
There wasn't much reaction to this tactic. Therefore, Germany also expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevalent view of most citizens and nations was inclined towards pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the grief and brutality of war through World War I, nations were eager to avoid a recurrence of that situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with only four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different eras; each period of China or each family that held power corresponded to a different dynasty.
Besides that, between dynasties were periods of instability when the regions were divided. The most famous period was the Three Kingdoms period which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce warfare occurred between numerous battles among the nobles to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying just to vie for the throne in the main hall of the city of Xi'an.
There were many political and social impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolute monarchy to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to any ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, professions were opened to all men seeking work, allowing even the most ambitious to succeed.
This also applies to the military, as military ranks are based on merit rather than seniority.
The French Revolution also motivated many oppressed working-class people in various countries, urging them to rise up in revolt.
Muhammad was deeply concerned about matters beyond this worldly life. He would often go to a cave called "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light) to contemplate.
Remaining timeless, the Hira cave preserves vivid images of the spiritual trend left by the prophet Muhammad.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if people know it exists. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
There's nothing but the clear, beautiful, high sky embracing the mountain ranges. A small world known and spoken of from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to commemorate the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings of Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, the largest), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's consorts and family members.
The "up-bow" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "down-bow" symbol looks like a pin or a square missing its bottom edge.
Up means you should start from the frog (the part at the end of the bow) and push the bow upwards, and down means you should start from the slide (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow downwards.
An up bow usually produces a lighter sound, while a down bow produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Feel free to mark it up, but remember that all the printed bow markings have musical meaning, so please respect them.
On October 6, 1789, while at the Palace of Versailles, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris in terror by a mob of market women.
In the carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows.
A person in the crowd waved the head of a slain royal guard from the Palace of Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The cost of the U.S. imperialist war in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover the bulk of expenditures and interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super-profits obtained from exploiting the Filipino people for a long time have become the main source of income for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that spurred its creation.
The era in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages occurred after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, conventionally ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is an umbrella concept encompassing many ideas in reality, from promoting or coercing technology to the narrow sense that human destiny is controlled by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development itself follows its own path, unaffected by culture and politics, and that technology has a "determining influence" on existing societies, rather than the other way around (society shaping technology).
For example, one might say that cars powered by engines inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for some car owners, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The overabundance of car ownership also leads to an increase in traffic accidents, prompting new technical innovations in the medical field to repair bodily injuries.
Romanticism has a significant element of cultural determination, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that region develop, and these, combined with social status, are still better than tyrannical laws being imposed.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was renowned as a focal point of opulence from around 400 BC and lasting until around 1100 AD.
The city's status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders brought back gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the costumes were heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments at that time, resulting from the Crusades, was that people began using buttons.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture that is practiced solely to provide enough food for the farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, typically only using organic fertilizers, utilizing saved seeds from local varieties, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this continues to be the case in many developing countries.
Group culture brings together like-minded individuals who feel rejected by societal norms and helps them gain a sense of belonging.
Subcultures can differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Factors that define distinct regional cultures can include language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of these elements.
Members of a cultural group often express their relationships through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles such as fashion, manner of speaking, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite unfortunate cases of children involving neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, and a lack of social contact from caregivers as the children grow up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been kept in confinement by people (often their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child is due to the parents rejecting a child with severe mental or physical impairments.
Street children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are believed to have had to live alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely identical to the animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more enjoyable, the Scaffolding education method goes a step further.
Modeling is not a learning method but a means of assisting people undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Lesson plans can be in physical or virtual form. In other words, the teacher themselves is a form of lesson plan, but like a tiny virtual assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software and aim to pose questions, provide reminders, and explain processes that might challenge students to solve problems independently.
Children are placed in alternative care for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse or even coercion.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, which they are currently experiencing.
We recognize that the Foster Care System is a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe housing, dedicated caregivers, a stable educational environment, and reliable medical care.
The shelter is seen as a place that provides the essentials that the children's previous homes couldn't.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to new aspects in how it is used and how satisfaction is approached.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Self-involvement" and "continuous correlation" are also viewed as new drivers according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they conducted an investigation into readers' reactions to websites.
The use of video cameras has led to important discoveries in interpreting microexpressions, which are facial movements that occur in just milliseconds.
Specifically, it is believed that a person can detect when someone is lying by accurately interpreting every subtle expression.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out how people who cannot understand the speech due to brain damage can accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that these abilities in interpreting human behavior might also exist in other animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have demonstrated that there are two groups of genetic variations: recessive and dominant.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
Segregation and recombination occur back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the desert, it would be difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human's to satisfy its need for essential amino acids from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily accessible plant sources would likely be the protein found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Conversely, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a rich source of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Having considered everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to the chimpanzees on the savanna today.
Sleep intervention is the process of intentionally waking a person during their normal sleep time and then allowing them to fall back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a virtually silent alarm clock to help you wake up without being jolted awake.
If you find yourself constantly hitting the snooze button, you can place your alarm clock in a different corner of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Biologically-based choices include drinking a lot of water (specifically like water or tea, which are known diuretics) before bed, which will cause us to wake up to urinate.
Inner peace is inversely proportional to the stress endured by the body and mind.
The more the tension diminishes, the more positive energy becomes apparent. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing holding us back on this path is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded with the compassionate path of Mahayana Buddhism and numerous Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation practices, and the path encompassing love.
According to Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing the forms of different deities, pure energy fields and chakras are activated, and a sense of enlightenment is generated.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. At the end of World War II, conflicts over systems, processes, and cultures caused these countries to become divided again.
In the two years following the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish line was broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans collapsed almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships and boats to transport goods is currently the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and cargo across the sea.
The traditional mission of the navy is to ensure the continued transport of people and goods of the nation, while also interfering with the movement of people and goods of the enemy.
One of the most notable examples recently is the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The United States tried to transport supplies and rations across the Atlantic to aid Great Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy also used U-boats to try to block this shipping traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain after having subdued the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping these animals for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats are typically raised in herds, foraging freely on hills or other grazing areas, mainly tended by children or teenagers, similar to sheep herding. These traditional herd-based livestock farming methods are still in use today.
Carriageways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull heavier loads at faster speeds compared to traveling on rough, everyday roads.
Tie bars were known quite early on to hold the rails in place; however, people gradually realized that these rails would work more efficiently if they had small metal plates at the head.
This has become the norm, however, iron caused the chariot wheels to break down more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus apes, did not have a fully upright gait.
Bipedal characteristics are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can participate in environmental movements, and we can even become environmental activists to alleviate the burden on the future to some extent.
This is similar to treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and figure out how to neutralize it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically thanks to human achievements in science and technology, and problems have also become more serious due to overpopulation coupled with people's excessive lifestyles.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4th, the handwritten manuscript signed by President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, a few blocks away.
Approximately 150 to 200 prints were created overnight, now known as the "Dunlap Broadside."
The first reading of this document was by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy was forwarded to London on August 10th.
These 25 Dunlap broadsides are believed to be the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy is lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think this animal is a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
Their feet are scaled and clawed. They lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex dinosaurs.
Virtually all computers we use today rely on transforming information encoded in binary form.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or "bits," used in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious symptoms immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are often insufficient for immediate diagnosis.
Perhaps the clearest sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or a toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense to name this group of insects.
This term originates from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, a highly adaptable insect capable of parasitizing humans.
Both blood-sucking bugs and bed bugs are late-leavers, adapted to living in nests or on hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This number has made MS one of the most common nerve-related diseases in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or the child's.
These couples have decided to plan for adoption.
In an adoption agreement, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through scientific methods, which have, in fact, guided most scientific research.
However, experimentation and testing are not the only experiments used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Acceptance is Aristotle's perspective on all issues related to science, including psychology.
As the understanding of Greece declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many rhythms observed in psychology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and the generation of these rhythms through the biological clock.
Circadian rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator and will continue its free-running cycle even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the most convincing pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to label the DNA inside bacteriophages with a radioactive phosphorus compound or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Gene mutations can cause various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected gene region, and whether the affected cell is a germ cell.
Only mutations in bacterial germline cells can be inherited by offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts travelers who enjoy visiting natural areas to immerse themselves in the natural landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and researching information about ecosystems.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from small towns to get to work, passing others who are heading to the very places they just left to work.
In the powered shuttle system, everyone is connected to and supports a separate car-based transportation system.
Today, science suggests that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that allowed humanity to evolve over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why does the transportation system generate so many complaints, and why do they make mistakes so frequently? Is it because the transportation engineers are not qualified enough? Or are there more fundamental reasons at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range; therefore, traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better simulate traffic flow, the relationship between three main characteristics has been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly into the air. The ability to fly helps them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
Thanks to this, they can hide in small places to escape from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, since we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide at times.
20% of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the ocean originates from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3980 miles) long. It gets water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramid complex was never surpassed in size and perfect construction techniques.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors that still stood a thousand years later.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is used as an everyday language by those working in the state, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all those elements can be found in nature in their elemental form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he theorized that they transform into new matter to form what we see.
Essentially, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
You can also have alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of extremely small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could be just the size of a period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, from its earliest days, the pencil has become a good friend to many.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerged, pencils gradually lost their place and are used less and less.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens and never have to use a pencil sharpener anymore.
One can only wonder what fate awaits the keyboard when something newer emerges.
A fission bomb works on the principle of using energy to split the nuclei of atoms with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Split the nucleus again and then release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they have a tendency to break apart with little or no provocation.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side of the Moon.
It is thinner under the maria (seas) and thicker in the highlands.
There may be multiple affected basins on the adjacent flank because the crust is thinner. Lava can more easily rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are acquired from external sources as they mature.
These theories examine what motivates some people to achieve what they want and whether there are factors in their environment that cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theoretical frameworks are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, there are two approaches that can emerge when a manager begins to lead former colleagues. The first approach is to try to maintain a close relationship.
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, apply discipline, evaluate performance, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
Some people will transform into a completely different person and feel they have to change everything the group is doing and do it themselves.
Ultimately, the leader is absolutely responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This action can sometimes lead to a rift in the relationship between leaders and other members of the team.
Remote teams must meet the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are still minor differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as liaisons between the team and physical team members closer to them.
They often have more autonomy than regular members because their team may meet on different timeframes, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of "invisible teams" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a distinctive component of virtual teams.
The "Invisible Team" is the management group that each member reports to. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational institution? One goal of putting organized learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fostered.
Therefore, the process of organizing and working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to new improvements to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership needs to cultivate a culture of creativity as well as share the knowledge and exploration of the entire collective.
Angel (2006) explains that Continuous Improvement is a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research process.
We have long known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in various neurological functions.
The development of new technology allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and data to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of the brain.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) holds great significance in science fiction, it also shapes a crucial branch of computer science, dealing with behaviors, learning abilities, sensitivity, and the simulation of intelligence in machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, diagnostic response capabilities and customer questions, as well as handwriting, speech, and facial recognition.
Such things have become personal rules, focused on providing solutions to practical problems in life.
Today's AI (artificial intelligence) systems are commonly used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in many home computing applications and electronic game software.
Field trips are an important part of the class. The teacher quite often takes students to places where taking the bus isn't an option.
Technology offers solutions through virtual reality trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in class.
Sharing the picnic trip online is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, each year the Bennet students in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol. Each year this website is remodeled, however, the old versions are maintained online as souvenirs.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. When starting a blog, these students often make grammatical and spelling errors due to carelessness, but the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Students are often the toughest critics, so the blog author started trying to improve the quality of their writing to avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to nurture audience interest inspires students to become intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools that stimulate collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional classroom setting.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more sensitive to analytical and reasoning skills; through positive responses to online material, students can identify their role in the context of other people's writing and present their own views on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, home to a wealth of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's historical and modern artifacts.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka, with its pristine natural beauty and more.
All of this and more highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider the quintessential Canada.
Vast areas further north are sparsely populated, and some regions are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison might surprise many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest region and a continent dedicated to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the region, and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
This area is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Female travelers should say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing rings can also have an effect (referring to types that don't look too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to situations they perceive as harassment, and that being followed, having their arm touched, etc., may be very normal.
Be assertive when refusing, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether or not there are cultural differences, that doesn't make wrong right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Kingdom of Morocco rebuilt the city in the style of Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find traditional Moroccan goods for sale, such as Tagine pots, ceramics, leather goods, Shisha pipes, and all sorts of knick-knacks, but these are mostly aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was leveled by the Nyiragongo volcano. This volcanic disaster buried a large part of the city, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma remains within permissible safety limits, all visits from outside the city should still be carefully studied to understand the current combat situation in North Kivu province.
This city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the most affordable gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for distant and exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger due to the encroachment of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
This city is in complete contrast to other cities in the country because it has a stronger Arabic style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, the Zimbabwe border to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of over 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each home to a unique wildlife ecosystem.
This is one of South Africa's main tourist attractions and it is considered a flagship site of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, conservation efforts take place daily, and entrance fees are required.
It also benefits someone buying a Wild Card, as it can grant you access to either the parks in South Africa or all the National Parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is what many visitors consider to be the main focal point.
The parade of buildings makes Hong Kong's skyline resemble a shimmering bar graph accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see Hong Kong from its best angle, leave the island and go straight to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban areas are developed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists seized land for their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a very good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The forest area within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Besides mangrove swamps, these forests also include some remaining areas of the majestic forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is water/swamp.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (along the river) throughout the day, although the main departures, especially for buses heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, will be between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Because inter-district buses often run out of seats, it's recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are very comfortable and reliable.
Sharing a taxi is a convenient and fast way to travel to nearby locations such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high and 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.5 meters wide.
The under-bridge clearance is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be officially operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are completed, as planned.
The Guaraní are the largest indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay, with a semi-nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle and subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," came into being following the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has strived to maintain its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches may also take place here at other times of the year.
For information about the tournament and where to buy polo tickets, visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Island pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP) at a fixed rate.
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, located on Stanley Street across from the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted anywhere in the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British pounds or US dollars may be; check with the owner in advance to see which payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands pounds outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located in the Southern Hemisphere, its summer is the Northern Hemisphere's winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, the temperature is often above +30°C.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely drop to freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer reading suggests.
There isn't a distinct "rainy" or "dry" season: rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wildlife and should not be fed or teased.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, gaurs, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are very large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be mindful of smells that can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking odorous foods and maintain cleanliness around your campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and officially became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the death of leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) belong to the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly safe sandy beaches for swimming, and most have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located on the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that can sometimes be crowded, with many shops lining the coast. It is a safe place to swim.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which isn't a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many types of French wines you should have, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be less affected when moved.
Local tap water is absolutely safe to drink, but bottled water is also readily available if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A Short black is an 'espresso,' a cappuccino has a cream topping (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate according to Belgian standards. Expensive but excellent fruit juice.
Tours to this coral reef are frequent year-round, and injuries caused by the reef are rare.
However, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the 1770 area. They can occasionally be encountered outside of this period as well.
Sharks do appear, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away to hide.
Saltwater crocodiles do not typically live in the open ocean; their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive.
Travel companies often partner with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel company.
Travel agencies often offer service packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combine airfare and hotel accommodations.
They can also hold the spot for you if you need time to consider the job offer or process other documents related to your destination (such as a visa).
Despite that, any requests or modifications must not be sent directly to the hotel, but must first be processed through the travel agency.
For some festivals, a large number of attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees view it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the activity area, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the sound system.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has stopped, there are still some areas of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, double-check your cabin, as icebreakers create terrible noises that not everyone can tolerate.
The Saint Petersburg cruise duration includes time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are visa-free (check conditions).
Casinos often try to get customers to spend as much time and money as possible. These places typically have no windows or clocks, and the exits are also very difficult to find.
They often provide special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers comfortable and to keep them staying longer.
Some establishments serve alcoholic beverages on-site. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all savvy gamblers understand the importance of keeping a clear head.
Anyone wanting to drive in high altitude areas or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The low friction on icy and snowy roads means you can't drive like you normally would on asphalt.
Even a short burst of snowfall during a blizzard can be enough to get you stranded.
Visibility can also be limited due to falling or blowing snow, or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal phenomena in many countries, and traffic is almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is probably the most attractive destination in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" is commonly used to refer to overland travel for wildlife viewing in Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes often approach vehicles, and we can easily observe them with ordinary equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be very cautious, so you should use binoculars to see them more clearly.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "trekking," or "hiking") involves hiking, lasting for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having previously hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary. However, as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies did not allow for extensions until July 2020 – the time the Games were originally scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if you don't see one in your room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing tights, you can use a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (it may shrink, or in severe cases, it may catch fire).
There are many ways to filter water, some of which are very effective at removing specific hazards.
In some places, boiling water for just one minute is enough, while in others, it needs to boil for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if you're concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from reputable companies.
Tourists may encounter harmful animals they have never seen in their home country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst-case scenario, trigger allergies, release toxins, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with their strength, are not typically considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from value-added tax and excise tax at certain locations.
Tourists visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The long distance between Point Marion and Fairmont creates some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through desolate, wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, you should prepare yourself for steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The speed limit in this area is significantly lower than the preceding and subsequent sections of the road - the common speed is around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to these regulations is extremely important.
The strange, natural thing is that the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of this route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite delicious, and in Bavaria, they are particularly rich and diverse, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit tarts are very popular here, with apples used to make them year-round, while cherries and plums are also used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The cakes taste even better when enjoyed with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small treat from pastries, try the ones that locals call Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of sauce in it.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; while in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more prevalent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an incredibly diverse fusion of regional culinary traditions from across the country.

Stirrups are devices that hang from the saddle to support the rider's feet.
They offer greater stability for the rider but there may be safety concerns due to the potential for trapping the rider's feet.
If a rider falls but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse continues to run. To minimize this risk, several precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wore boots with high heels and smooth, rather narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to fall away from the saddle if the rider is dragged in a fall.

Downhill skiing sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving sliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity, with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," planning entire vacations solely around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing has been around for a very long time — cave paintings depicting skiers have been found from as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing has been a popular sport since at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was founded by Norwegians living in Australia.
Ski mountaineering: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It's related, but usually doesn't include strolling or alpine ski touring; the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of skiing as similar to hiking.
Under favorable conditions, you will cover a greater distance than walking – but you rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing when not carrying a heavy pack and skiing on a flat surface.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Usually, traveling through many countries means having to apply for visas and have your passport checked multiple times.
However, in this aspect, the Schengen Area operates almost as a single country.

Similarly, by possessing a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no specific definition to determine whether a manufactured item is an antique. Some tax authorities stipulate that goods over 100 years old are antiques.
This definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts can be considered antiques, even though their age is much younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is the livelihood of the Sami people, and the culture surrounding it is also important to many people in other trades.

A rip current is a flow of water rushing back out to sea from waves breaking on the beach, typically occurring near a reef or similar structure.
Due to the underwater terrain, reverse currents concentrate in some deeper areas, and rapid currents flowing into deep water can form there.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which seems impossible.
Once you're free of the whirlpool, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try swimming in a direction that avoids being swept away by the current, or stay put and wait for rescue, depending on your skill level and whether anyone has noticed your distress.

On some routes, large companies often have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, this is a problem.
If they ship goods by air, on some routes it can take several days to unload the cargo and clear customs.
The only way to ship goods faster is as checked baggage. Aviation regulations don't allow unaccompanied baggage, and that's where you come in.
One obvious way is to fly first class or business class, which means spending a significant amount of money for this privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, the cost is not cheap at all: as a general rule, you can expect to pay four times the price of an economy ticket for a business class ticket, and eleven times the price for a first class ticket!
Generally, it's pointless to hunt for discounts on business or first-class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
