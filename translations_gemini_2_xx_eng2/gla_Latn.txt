Scottish Athletics supports the United States Olympic Committee’s letter and accepts that the Olympic family has a great need to create a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that it could be more beneficial for our athletes and clubs, and their sport, if we move forward with meaningful change within our organisation, rather than being decertified.
USA Gymnastics is supporting an independent investigation that could clarify how the abuse at the level courageously described by those who went through the abuse by Larry Nassar could go unrecognised for so long, and will accept any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal – to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, but to allow athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor throughout the 1960s, and then for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
He advised Carter on foreign policy in the 1976 elections and then held the position of National Security Advisor (NSA) between 1977 and 1981 after Henry Kissinger.

This is proof, not only that some dinosaurs were feathered – a theory that is already widely known – but it gives a level of detail that fossils cannot usually give us, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was reddish-brown on the surface with a pale or carotenoid colour underneath.
This new study also gives us a glimpse into the micro-structure of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a developed shaft, known as a rachis, but possess other feather features – barbs and barbules – the researchers believed that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feather suggests to us that it wasn't used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest to us that, even if this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult feathers and not down.
The researchers suggested that the sample showed adult feathers rather than downy fluff, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They found that the Sun operates according to the very same fundamental principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of all the stars in the galaxy was governed by their luminosity, their rotation rate, and that nothing else was involved.
The luminosity and rotation are being used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic dynamo.

The Iraq Survey Group published its report today at 12.00 GMT.
He is warning that there is absolutely no guarantee that there is a way forward in Iraq at this stage that will stop the sectarian war, the increasing violence, or the path towards compromise.
The report begins with a call for open debate and consensus-building in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East.
The report strongly criticizes almost every aspect of the Government's current policy towards Iraq, and it calls for a radical change of direction.
Among his 78 recommendations, the first is that a new diplomatic initiative be undertaken before the end of the year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interference and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbours.
The current senator and First Lady of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced last night in La Plata, a city about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will be running for president.

It was largely theoretical work, but the program was written to represent what was seen of the soldier's constellation.
The effect the team was seeking would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the zodiac and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, causing the ocean tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the constellation Sagittarius.
The scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of disc, and it is made of lots of small fragments.
Television reports are showing white smoke coming from the factory.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered a strain of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new genre was "a cause of great worry and fear because of the very high mortality rate."
It's possible some of the patients caught the bug in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were healthcare workers in the hospital.
In a year, a person with an infectious disease might pass the disease on to 10 to 15 people close to them.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB appears low in the entire group of people sick with tuberculosis; 6,000 of the total; 330,000 people estimated at any given time in South Africa.

They found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, there, which was covered in bloody blankets.
The police said the body appeared to have been there for about a day.
The first cases of the disease were reported this season at the end of July.
It is pigs that carry the disease, which then migrates to humans through the horsefly.
This outbreak has prompted the Indian government to deploy mosquito nets as pig catchers in the affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito curtains and spraying insecticides.
The government has pledged several million syringes with meningitis vaccines and this will help health organizations next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to the areas historically worst affected have been delayed due to funding shortages and low prioritization compared to other diseases.
S?ania emigrated to Sweden in 1956, and started working at the Swedish Post Office and three years later he got a job as their chief engraver.

Infrared images showing the difference between night and day temperatures suggest they are probably caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as consistent as large caves on Earth that often have very consistent heat, but it is consistent as they are large holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting practices have not advanced much: voters, alone in a booth, put a pre-printed paper slip with the name of their chosen candidate into an envelope.
The voter will put the ballot in the ballot box and they will sign the voter register after officials have verified the voter's identity.
French electoral law codifies proceedings in a rather strict way.
Ballot boxes must be transparent since 1988 so that voters and observers can see that there are no papers inside at the start of the vote, and that no papers are added except those from voters who have been counted and authorised.
Candidates may appoint proxies to monitor every step of the process. The votes will be counted by volunteers on the night under close scrutiny, following specific procedures.

Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21, were the people who were killed. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla was injured in the arm and pectoral muscle, and Kristoffer Schneider was left needing reconstructive surgery to his face.
Uka's weapon misfired as he was aiming it at the head of the fifth man. There is a constant, dull pain in his eye socket, a section of his skull is missing, and his face has been rebuilt from titanium by Schneider.
Schneider provided video link route certification from a USAF base in his own country.
Following Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two separate races at the Winning Championships.
The slalom was her first event and she got "Did Not Finish" on her first run. The same result occurred in the race for 36 of the 116 competitors.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she was in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's seated group failed to complete their runs, and 45 out of the 117 skiers overall in the Giant Slalom failed to rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General, D K Arya, said, "We have arrested five men who raped the Swedish woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the names of the people who are accused.
Police Director Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident happened was closed for a while while the emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to hospital in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After this, she was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with murdering her own son.
She is in custody awaiting charge and trial, but eyewitness testimony may not be accepted because her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice in the rest of the United Kingdom, but Scots law is different and the courts have taken the view that the publication of camera images could cause prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos and so on of people who are under suspicion."
The Crown Office, which is generally in charge of prosecutions, has indicated to the press that they will not be making any further comment until the indictment.
The document, according to leaks, will mention the border dispute and the Palestinian demand for one based on the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East War.
It is being said that he is also dealing with the future status of Jerusalem, a city holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel wants its army to leave the valley area for ten years once an agreement is signed, but the PA will only agree to their presence for five years.
The watchers were supposed to keep a close eye on the burners during the completion of the vermin eradication trial because it was a trial under scrutiny and its success was being assessed.
Accredited volunteers were employed under the hunting program at the Sporting Shooters' Association, in partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Director of Conservation and Heritage for the Park, Mick O’ Flynn, the four gunners selected for the initial culling operation received full safety guidance and training.
Martelly presided over the swearing-in of nine new members of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
This month, the president's commission recommended that the former CEO step down as part of a series of initiatives that will move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread evidence against the regime that began in October.
The unrest, which was violent at times, arose because elections had not been held, some of which were due to be held since 2011.
Reports have been received of around 60 cases of broken iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said they were aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
METI announced last week that Apple had notified them of 34 further preheating incidents but the company said "they weren't serious."
The ministry responded by saying that Apple's delay of the report was "deeply regrettable."
The Mariana earthquake struck at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
The emergency management office in the Northern Mariana Islands said they had received no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami threat.
A retired Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired the M16 rifle at the tourists.
A number of hostages were rescued, and it was confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
The photographers replaced the old woman later because she needed the toilet. Mendoza was knocked down by gunfire.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and carved out a lifelong career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature labour in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone would accelerate the premature maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, the "black boxes", on Wednesday.
The co-op also valued Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night of two moons. A very special night just like her. A smart woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels said that “Luna was just as crazy as I am... or maybe even worse... love her and I'll miss her... hope she is in a better place.”
The number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008 among 1,400 people whose opinion was sought before the 2010 federal election.
The then-interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard maintained during the 2010 federal election campaign that she wanted Australia to become a republic with the Queen Elizabeth II as head of state.
34 percent of people in the poll share the same opinion, that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
As marginal views, 29 percent of those in the survey believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, but 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle races and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but following the complaints he raised, questions have arisen about integrity.
He couldn't take the drugs he needs to control the pain because they are banned in the games.
Curtis Cooper, who is a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people tested the new tracker with different hardware and software before the launch of the Wren and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets were the original deliverers of water to Earth and of organic material from which proteins can be formed and which would nurture life.
The scientists are hoping to gain an understanding of how planets are formed, especially how the Earth came into being, since comets struck the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill the month before that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as "chatter and political nonsense".
It is being speculated that he will stand for leadership in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to travel shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
He is using satellite-based technology rather than the old ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft positions with greater accuracy and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged and trains will not stop above ground at Wembley and there is no car parking or park and ride facilities available at the park.
There were fears that there wouldn't be enough cover and that made it more likely that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in America and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that evolution in the new species occurred after only two generations, although it was thought that this process took much longer, due to breeding between the Darwin's finch and native Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, which is a migrant bird.
Gold can be formed into many different shapes. It can be rolled into tiny, minuscule shapes.
It can be made into thin wire that can be spun and folded. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be beaten into a very thin form and stuck to other metal. It can be beaten into such a thin form that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
In chemistry, this is called pH. You can make an indicator with purple cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change colour depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been stripped (since a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze them together into balls.
The moisture on your hands will interact with the outer layers, which will feel strange and create a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet, connected to a complex sewage system.
Traces of sewage remnants were found in houses in the Minoan towns on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilisation, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women mingled.
When you phone someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite will pick up the call in space and then throw it back down, almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space on a rocket. Scientists will use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
A very large rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredibly big ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transport.
He gave us the train, the car, and many other forms of transport.
According to them, it is a medium-large cat that eats medium-large prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including pet cats) that eat the small prey that is more abundant, including insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their philosophy of "niche" is the reason for their success, that is a specific turn each cat makes that keeps it from trying others.
The lion is the most sociable cat there is, and they live in large groups called prides.
There are between one and three adult males related to each other in a lair, and up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually close to each other, being members of a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions are very similar in behaviour to wolf packs or hunting dogs, animals that, oddly, resemble lions (but not other big cats) in their behaviour and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a skilled athlete, capable of climbing (although not very good at it), swimming, leaping great distances, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong person.
Tigers are in the same group (the panthera genus) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not the same as the full-throated roar of the lion. It's more like a stream of grumbling words being shouted.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can get a hold of them. Almost every animal the ocelot hunts is much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate edible animals (prey) by scent, sniffing the air to detect their previous location.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and they also move in a very cunning way. Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding themselves in their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (for example, if they migrate across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back) they are often in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competition, and the new population needs different tools or adaptations compared to what they needed before they can be strong competitors.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptation they needed before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to their new environment, their appearance changes until they no longer look like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that you wouldn't be able to say they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, this simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of microevolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people breathe out (or let out).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We are building our houses with plants and making clothes with plants. Plants are what we eat most. Without plants, animals would not survive at all.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time and it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
It had over 70 sharp, sharp teeth in its long jaws and another row in the roof of its mouth, and with that, nothing that happened upon it could escape.
We don't know for sure yet, but he might have had a forked tongue. He was eating turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it's possible that he was even a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that went into the water; even a huge dinosaur like T. rex wouldn't stand a chance against him.
Although we would recognize most of their food, there was a good amount of strange or unusual things that you would find on Roman tables such as wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their food sitting on stools while wealthy men preferred to hold feasts where they lay on their sides eating.
There was no way that food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries would have been in the food of the ancient Romans.
For example, they didn't have maize or tomatoes or potatoes or cocoa and an ancient Roman never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each of their gods and they believed that was the god's home.
People would make sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would attempt to cater to the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple and sacred place had an open courtyard which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, towers in the shape of a pyramid called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
The house wasn't so important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
It was on the great battlefield outside that most of the Hebrew family's world took place.
The women made the food behind the house; there was nothing in the shops but counters that were open to the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, and as a result, wood was extremely expensive.
Settlement in Greenland was sparse. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and that when he was on his journey further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But despite his "new" discovery, Inuit tribes were already living there at the time.
Although every country was "Norse," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the United States Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "The original Declaration of Independence, dated 4th July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
It is not known for certain who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document (it is 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
It seems, then, that the note was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
This was governed by "Vichy" French. They were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
The Allies invaded the south of France on August 15th, 1940, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
It didn't even take a fortnight until the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and until they faced Germany.
Civilization is a single culture that a large group of people generally share who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *cīvīlis*, meaning civil, related to the Latin *cīvis*, meaning citizen, and *cīvitās*, meaning town or city-state, and this also explains the size of the society.
City-states came before nations. If it is a civilizational culture, that implies knowledge accumulated over many centuries, a cultural footprint that lasts longer, and a fair distribution of that culture.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence behind, and they are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the 13 states established a weak government – which consisted only of the Congress – under the Articles of Confederation of the United States.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, since there was no executive or judicial branch, the enforcement of every act depended on the authorities of the states, who were not always cooperative.
He had no authority to enact further laws governing taxes and tariffs between states.
The articles required agreement from every state before an amendment could be made, and the states didn't take the central government seriously, and as a result, their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
It is in the northern areas that winter sports are most popular, and Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan owns more or less 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), and therefore, Japan is the seventh largest island country in the world!
As a result of Japan's island grouping, it is often said that Japan is a "maritime nation" in the geographical sense.
Taiwan's roots begin far back in the 15th century when European sailors sailed past and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, triggering major changes in the ways the natives cultivated grains and employed Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a territory of the Qing Empire in 1885.
The Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), and this ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the site were rebuilt so that tourists could better see what they would have originally looked like.
Around a third of Machu Picchu had been restored by the year 1976 and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35mm is still the most common format for taking still camera photographs and it was the most common film size at the end of the era of analog films.
It is still being done today but, more importantly than that, its aspect ratio was inherited as a legacy in the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is a bit confusing.
During that time, it is said that this format has an aspect ratio of 3:2 (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio which is a whole number).
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) are identical or close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and mocked, is nothing more than a simple guideline for creating compositions that still retain a degree of order in a picture.
He is saying that the intersection of the lines which divide the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example image) is the best place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
The Christian faith had been uniting the European states for well over a thousand years, despite their different languages and customs.
This universal power affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the core Christian philosophies is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and it is for that very reason that the church's wealth is distributed alternately.
The church's main authority had been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money in one place led many to question whether this ideal was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the war began, Britain organised a naval blockade against Germany.
It was an effective strategy that prevented vital civilian and military supplies, although this blockade violated international laws to which most countries had subscribed and which had been codified in several international agreements in the last two hundred years.
Britain laid mines in international waters to keep ships out of large areas of the ocean, and this put even neutral ships at risk.
Since they hadn't received too great a response to this tactic, the Germans expected a similar response when they turned to all-out submarine warfare.
Pacifism and isolationism were the most common philosophies among citizens and nations during the 1920s.
After the horrors and terrors of war experienced during the First World War, nations wanted such a situation to never happen again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to America to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his old job) to Thomas Edison.
There was a very peculiar way of indicating different periods in ancient China; each Chinese era or each royal family was designated as a specific dynasty.
There was a period of unstable division of provinces between each dynasty as well. The Three Kingdoms period was the best-known of these periods, lasting 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
There was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne during these times.
The era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, and thousands died fighting for the right to sit in the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
It yields many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just one ruler.
Every position was open to any man who applied after the revolution as well, and that gave an opportunity for success to those who were most ambitious and most successful.
Likewise in the army, for army rank is now based on the virtues and merit of the soldier rather than on social class.
The French Revolution inspired many intellectuals who were oppressed in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed placed great importance on matters beyond worldly life. He would visit a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which survived that era, gives us a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca is remote from the rest of the world.
Even so, it's not easy to find even if you knew it was there. Once you're in the cave, it will be utter solitude.
Nothing can be seen but the clear sky above and the many mountains that surround it. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Since it was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid has been one of many large pyramidal structures that honoured a dead Pharaoh.
There are several pyramids (and the great pyramid is the largest of them), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx on the Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arch up" symbol looks like a V, and the "arch down" symbol looks like a staple or a square without a bottom.
"Up" means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and "down" means you should start at the nut (where your hand grips the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually evokes a gentler sound, but a down-bow is bigger and more vigorous.
You can add your own pencil markings, but remember that the bowing marks are printed in for musical reasons, and so should usually be followed.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese who was 11 years old and Louis-Charles who was 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, all fearing for their lives, were chased back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on the 6th of October 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, with a rabble of people around them who were screaming and threatening the king and queen.
A gang of people forced the king and queen to keep their car windows shut.
It happened that a member of the mob shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in his hand in front of the queen, who became deathly afraid for her life.
It was the people of the Philippine Islands themselves who paid the war costs involved in the conquest during United States imperialism.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the USA, against a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were launched in the name of the government of the Philippine Islands through Wall Street banking houses.
Undoubtedly, the excessive profits rooted in the continued conquest of the Philippines would be among the primary benefits of American imperialism.
Before you understand the Templars, you must understand the situation in which the order was created.
This period is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries in European history (AD 1000-1200).
Before the High Middle Ages, there was the Early Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages followed them. According to common usage, they came to an end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a phrase that truly encompasses many things, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that says the fate of mankind is being driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two ideas in common: that technological development itself follows a path that is largely outside the influence of culture or politics, and that, in turn, technology has inherent "effects" on societies, rather than being influenced by society.
For example, you could say that roads will be improved alongside the motor car without it disappearing.
However, a national network of economic roads is not just for a small number of cars, and new methods for car manufacturing are being designed to make car ownership cheaper.
With the majority of the population owning cars, there is a higher frequency of accidents on roads, which leads to new innovations in healthcare for treating injured bodies.
There was a large element of cultural certainty within the romanticism that came from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Regarding romanticism, the land influenced the local people, and customs and traditions belonging to the land arose over time. And, these were better than laws imposed arbitrarily because they were in harmony with the place where the people were.
In the same way that Paris is regarded as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Kosice was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It gained fame as a centre of learning around the year 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were considered more valuable than what the Byzantine markets were offering.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture in the East greatly influenced clothing.
However, due to slow communication channels, the styles in the west might be 25 to 30 years behind.
Near the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to use its own style, and one of the biggest things they cared about at the time, during the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture where just enough food is grown to directly sustain the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, very often organic, which uses seeds belonging to the eco-region together with crop rotation or other very simple methods to obtain as much yield as possible.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and that remains true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people who share a similar way of thinking and who feel that societal standards ignore them, and they allow them to create an identity for themselves.
Subcultures can be identifiable as a result of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinct can be related to language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of characteristics.
Members of a subculture often signal their involvement by using a distinctive and symbolic style that encompasses fashions, behaviors, and dialects.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at what happened in the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, while they were growing up.
Children like this are called "feral children" or wild. Some of these feral children were kept indoors by people (usually their own parents); in some situations this was done with the parents denying the real or perceived intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Children who went wild may have suffered significant child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is maintained that some of them were raised by animals; it is said that they lived outside on their own in the wilderness.
If a child is raised entirely by non-human animals, the behaviour of the child will be almost entirely like that of the animal that raised it (as far as physically possible), regarding people either as prey or as insignificant.
Although project-based learning may make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding as a teaching method is merely a means of support that aids people who are learning something new, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is as much a type of scaffolding as the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding is mentioned in the software and it is for questioning, encouraging, and explaining procedures that were, perhaps, unnecessarily difficult for the student to deal with on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, including neglect and abuse, and even destitution.
No child should grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We are looking at the foster care system as a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system has a right to offer safe homes, loving carers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Foster care has a right to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The particular qualities of the internet are creating additional dimensions with regard to the reception of use and enjoyment.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are suggested as important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational elements by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their research on audience perceptions of websites.
Many new discoveries have been made through video recording in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only fractions of a millisecond.
They particularly claim that you can tell if someone is lying by reading their subtle facial expressions correctly.
In his paper, "Presidential Address," Oliver Sacks revealed that people who do not understand language due to brain damage can still make an accurate assessment of sincerity.
He's even saying that animals like domestic dogs might thus be able to understand human emotion.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two stores of genetic variation: one hidden and one revealed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variability back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to get the amino acids it needs from the plants that are available.
Furthermore, there are negative consequences if this is not done: a decline in production, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins in leaves and leguminous plants were the most easily found plant resources, but they are difficult for primates like ourselves to digest unless they are boiled.
On the contrary, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also full of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Ultimately, it shouldn't be surprising to us if our ancestors solved "the protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees solve it on the African savanna today.
Sleep fragmentation is when you intentionally wake yourself up during your usual sleep time and then fall back asleep a short while later (between 10 and 60 minutes).
It's easy to do this by using a quiet marching clock that puts you in the mood without fully waking you up.
If you make sure you reset the alarm clock while you're half-asleep, place it to be fixed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the circadian rhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known diuretics) before bedtime, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The amount of peace in a person's heart is proportionate to the amount of fitness in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the better the life force. Everyone has the ability to find true peace and complete satisfaction.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. It is only our own ego and negativity that stand in the way of this destination.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha but was expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many practices that came from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. Within it are Kundalini Yoga, intense meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Yoga of the Divine is the main Tibetan means of meditation. By visualising different deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are stimulated and a sense of enlightenment is created.
The common enemy in Germany during the Second World War caused cooperation between the USSR and the USA. When the war came to an end, the two countries turned on each other due to a conflict of systems, processes and cultures.
The old allies were now enemies two years after the end of the war, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and there would be real conflicts, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17th, 1939, the Polish defensive line had already been broken, and all that was left was to retreat and regroup beyond the Romanian bridgehead.
However, it wasn't even a night before these plans were useless when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union came in to create the Belarussian Front and the Ukrainian Front after breaking into areas in eastern Poland, breaking the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across oceans.
The job of navies traditionally is to ensure that your country has the ability to move goods and people, and at the same time, to hinder your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The Battle of the Atlantic in the Second World War was one of the most formal examples of this recently. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, was trying to prevent this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans might have conquered Britain as they did the rest of Europe.
It seems goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so they could easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Goats were generally kept in herds that would roam the moor or other pastures. Goat-herds, who were usually children or youths, would often tend them, and this is similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still in use today.
Railways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although waggonways were only wooden planks laid side by side, they allowed horses pulling them to travel at a faster speed and to haul larger loads than they could on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Crossbeams were introduced very early on to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was noticed that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on them.
This became a routine, but the iron would wear down the wooden wheels of the chariots more.
Iron wheels eventually replaced wooden wheels. All-iron rails first appeared in 1767.
As far as we know, walking was the first mode of transportation to emerge, mankind began walking on two legs two million years ago when homo erectus (meaning upright man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk quite upright.
Bipedalism is found in australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be better to the environment in our lives, we can get involved in environmental campaigns and we can even be activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This is just like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clear from the effect on the world that so much has changed in it due to the advances in human science and technology, and that problems have increased due to overpopulation and humanity's wasteful lifestyle.
After the Continental Congress approved it on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the president of the Continental Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, which was a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies of it were made overnight, which are known today as "Dunlap broadsides".
John Nixon was the one who read this document publicly for the first time in the yard of Independence Hall on the 8th of July.
One was sent to George Washington on the 6th of July, and he had it read to the soldiers in New York on the 9th of July. A copy reached London on the 10th of August.
The 25 broadsheets known to us that still exist are the oldest surviving versions of the document. The original manuscript has not survived to this day.
Many paleontologists believe that a herd of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them "birds."
There are many people who don't look at them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-rex.
Nearly all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits in the jargon of computer people.
Internal poisoning might not be obvious immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are common enough that a diagnosis can't be made right away.
Perhaps the best sign of poisoning at home is if you see medicine bottles or harmful household chemicals lying open.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The word "bug" is used by experts in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is based on an ancient recognition of night moths as tiny insects that are very well suited to being parasites on humans.
Both the kissing bug and the night bug are nest dwellers, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
Across the United States of America, there are about 400,000 people known to be suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research found that MS was twice as likely to affect women as it is to affect men.
A couple might decide that it's not good for them or for their own child to be raising him/her/it.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main aim of science is to understand how the world works, using the scientific method. This method, therefore, is what guides the majority of scientific research.
It's not just testing, however, and testing is an experiment used to nullify at least one hypothesis, asking questions and observation also guide scientific research.
The natural scientists and philosophers paid close attention to the classical texts and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were being accepted on every scientific matter, including psychology.
The more knowledge of Greek declined, the more the West was separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have noted that rhythms in human psychology and behaviour necessitate the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
There are reports of periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external time cues, in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks contain self-sustaining oscillators that keep the cycle going freely for a while even when external cues are absent.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the key things that made people realize that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into the bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the specificity of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are gametes or not.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed down to offspring, although mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in tours of natural areas to enjoy views of the landscape, the plants and the wildlife.
These are examples of activities on the site: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and gathering information about the ecosystem.
Visiting, taking photos, and learning about the orangutan in Borneo is an example of this.
People travel to work in the car every morning from small towns in the north, and others will pass them going to work in the place they have left.
In this convoluted, engineered mess, everyone is connected in some way and supporting a transport system based on private cars.
Science is now telling us that this enormous carbon economy has knocked the planet off one of its stable states that has supported the evolution of humanity for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developing countries, you rarely hear the same amount of complaints about the cleanliness of the water or bridges falling apart.
Why are commuter routes causing such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are the commuter engineers simply useless? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is studying the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to analyse traffic flow because not everything a driver does is predictable with complete certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers follows patterns that are moderately consistent; as a result, traffic flows have reasonably good consistency and the behaviour can be represented fairly well mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful in the planning, design and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more successfully and find food and mates in a more efficient way.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings neatly against their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places where they can hide themselves from predators.
Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects today that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Earth orbited the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the system of the sun was encompassing the Earth, including the sun (and even the rest of the stars).
It is thought that this is sensible, because it doesn't seem likely that the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river in the world. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, being six miles wide in places.
At least 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon is 6,387km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and technological sophistication of the pyramids at Giza.
The Egyptians of the New Kingdom in ancient Egypt marveled at the monuments of their ancestors that were already over a thousand years old then.
There are about 800 people living in Vatican City. It is the smallest independent country and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is the everyday language used by most of the people who work in the state, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every citizen in Vatican City is a Papist.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times because these are found in nature in their native form and it is relatively easy to dig them up with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is made up of a mixture of at least one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also had a theory that they would become new substances which would create what we see.
An alloy is a mixture of at least two metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Undoubtedly, there are other metals as well, such as silver and gold.
Alloys can also be found that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of particles called atoms.
Atoms are so unbelievably tiny that trillions of them would fit in the full stop at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was very useful to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods arose, the status and use of the pencil has steadily declined.
People now write letters on computer screens without ever laying a hand on a typewriter.
One can only imagine what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along and supersedes it.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to hold a nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
A carthorse is like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again will release some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they are prone to splitting with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on this side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is flatter under sailors and thicker under the highland of the moon.
Perhaps there are more marram grasses on the other side because the crust is thinner. It was much easier for the lava to rise without a surface.
Content theories seek information on what excites people or what appeals to them.
These theories state that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they grow into adults.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they want, and what things in the environment make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two popular content theories.
Generally, two modes of behaviour can arise when managers start to manage their former peers. One way is to try to continue "as one of the gang".
This type of manager has problems with unpleasant, disciplinary decisions, performance appraisals, delegating responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, there is the person who wouldn't acknowledge anyone else, someone who feels that he or she must change everything that the previous team did and do it according to their own way.
After that and subsequently, the success or failure of the team will be the responsibility of the leader.
This behavior often comes between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same high standards are expected from online teams as from regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Key members of the team often act as contact points for the physics group closest to them.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones that their local managers may not understand.
If a "phantom team" truly exists (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109), it is a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would a group go through the long process of establishing a learning organisation? Innovation is one goal of implementing group learning concepts.
When all available resources are used effectively across every functional area of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge.
During that time, if a group works together to solve an obstacle, an innovative process may emerge that meets the customer's needs.
Before a group can be innovative, leaders must foster a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Followership approach as a support tool to help groups reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying psychology. Therefore, it reduces the limitations of research and makes them much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior is the evidence for scientists in their research.
It has been long known that different types of injury, trauma, wounds, and tumours on the brain affect behaviour and changes in some of the functions of the mind.
New technology is giving us the opportunity to see and research the structures and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create virtual reality models that will help us understand what is going on in our minds.
Although you might often think of science fiction when you hear about AI, it is a very important branch of computer science, and deals with ethics, learning and intelligent tuning in a machine.
AI research aims to build machines that can perform tasks autonomously that require human intelligence.
Among the examples, guidance, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and user questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition can be found.
Such things have branched out into separate disciplines, emphasizing providing solutions to real-life problems.
The IF system is frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military nowadays and has been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. It will often happen that a teacher would like to take their students to a place that is not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum treasures, visit waterfalls, or enjoy fine art while sitting with the class.
A virtual field trip that is shared is also a good way to remember a trip and show classes in the future an impression of what was done.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Legislature each year, the website is redesigned each year but the old versions are kept online as an archive.
Blogs are also helpful for improving students' writing. Although the grammar and spelling are often rough at first, they generally get better when they gain readers.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blog writer will do their best to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them." Because they have to provide things that are interesting to the readers, we are encouraging the students to be aware and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and encourages students to continue with their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
If blogs are used appropriately, "students can be encouraged to be more exploratory and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can clarify their positions in relation to the writings of others and summarise their own views on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada, and one can find a variety of art galleries and museums there which showcase Canada from the past to the present day to the general public.
Further south is Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more, like an Ontario sample, is what foreigners consider "Canadian" in its entirety.
The large areas further north have a sparse population, and some of them are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
Now, here's a population comparison that will surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, as a continent in its own right, in terms of wildlife.
The majority of the small islands are independent nations or in a commonwealth with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it spread greatly in the Comoro Islands and in Mayotte.
The influence of the Europeans and colonialism rose in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India past the Cape.
The area is bordered to the north, south and west by the Sahel and to the west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travellers are advised to say they are married, whether they are or not.
It's also useful to wear a ring (but avoid one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that something they might consider harassment could be traced back to cultural differences, and it would be no surprise if they were followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be steadfast in refusing men, and do not be afraid to put your foot down (cultural differences in or out, right is not on their side!).
The town known today as Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenid people as an important port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, before abandoning the place after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the town as Daru I-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is the least interesting place in Morocco for shopping.
It's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods around the old Medina, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of trinkets, but they are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, far to the east, near Rubhanda.
Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano in 2002, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is moderately safe, you should do some research before taking any trips away from Goma until the state of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province is understood.
This town is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and some of the mountain gorilla treks in Africa can also be found there.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel within Goma. The typical (local) price for a short journey is ~500 Congolese Francs.
Because it is difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" became a symbol of strange, far-off lands.
Timbuktu is today a poor town, although its reputation attracts tourists and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger in 1990 because it is threatened by desert sand.
It was in one of the main places where Henry Louis Gates' PBS series "Africa's Great Civilizations" stopped.
The town is quite different from other cities in the country, as it has more of an African than an Arabic feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park is 19,500 km² and there are 14 different ecoregions within it, each one supporting different wildlife.
He is among the top South African game rangers and is regarded as the pride of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entry fees payable to the park.
It could be the same benefit if you buy a Wild Card, which gives access to either a choice of parks in South Africa, or all the National Parks in the country.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the main attraction in the opinion of many tourists.
People have said that the Hong Kong skyline resembles shimmering bar codes seen along the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's developed urban land is on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that British colonists took for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial history, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, bordering the sea, and extending 80 km (50 mi) inland into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans are designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest within Indian borders is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests aren't just mangrove swamps – they contain some of the last remaining fragments of the vast jungles that once stretched across the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², and about a third of them are aquatic or wetland habitats.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that the area now contains 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the intercity station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially the buses that go to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Because the buses between the districts are often full, you'd be better off buying a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Coaster buses from Japan, and they are comfortable and robust.
Taxis are a clever, comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the town of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and its two lanes are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. It was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the timetable, the bridge will be fully completed in September 2007 and it is expected that Brazilian customs inspection posts will be ready then.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in the areas where eastern Paraguay is today, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
Other native tribes inhabited the Chaco region, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "Gigantic Province of the Indies", was born as a result of Spanish conquerors encountering the indigenous tribes.
The Spanish began an era of settlement that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its original character and identity.
Argentina has a reputation because they have one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year will take place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For updated tournaments and information on where to purchase tickets for polo games, see the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which has a fixed value equal to one Pound Sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
British banknotes are usually accepted anywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
There's a good chance credit cards won't be accepted on the Outer Hebrides, but they might accept British and US currency; ask the owners in advance what payment methods they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange it before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it will be summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in summer.
The cold of winter can be deceptive: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and the humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer suggests.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall does not change much throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to people, they are still wild animals and people should not feed them or intrude on them.
According to park authorities, you should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from any other wild animal!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, bears and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of travellers are hurt each year because they didn't keep far enough away. These animals are big and wild and may be dangerous, so make sure they have enough space.
In addition to this, be aware that odours will attract bears and other wildlife, so please avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and there are barely 40,000 people living there.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
It was here that a famous naval mutiny occurred in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA and Britain refused to leave port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British destroyer. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
When there was a struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed at a peaceful gathering in the town.
There are many beaches because Auckland is between two harbours. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (including the North Harbour area) are found on the edge of the Pacific Ocean and they stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where one can swim safely, and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tāmaki Drive lie beside the Waitematā Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes busy with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
"Number One" is the main local beer, it's not a sophisticated beer but it's pleasant and refreshing. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for a trip.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is an "espresso", a cappuccino is full of cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is just as good as Belgian hot chocolate. Fruit juice is expensive but very good.
Many trips are taken to the buoy throughout the year, and people are rarely injured on the buoy as a result of any of these reasons.
After that, take advice from the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The sea otter lives near the beach and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. It can sometimes be found outside of these times.
There are sharks but they attack people very rarely. Sharks are afraid of people and would rather swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't really live in the ocean, their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If you reserve a place in advance, the traveller will have peace of mind knowing they will have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often offer deals with specific hotels, but you may be able to arrange alternative accommodations with a travel agency, such as campsites.
Travel companies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport, or even a package that includes the flight and hotel.
They can also hold your place if you need extra time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendments or requests should be directed through the travel agent in the first instance rather than being sent to the hotel directly.
For some music festivals, most of the people attending stay on site and most of the attendees consider it a crucial part of the festival.
If you want to be close to where everything is happening, you need to get in early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has finished, many venues at the festival will keep the music going late into the night.
Some festivals have camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, secure everything in the cabin, because the movement through the ice will cause a sound that will terrify those nearest.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are not subject to visa requirements (verify terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximise the time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually offer special food, drink and entertainment to keep guests happy so that they don't leave the gambling venue.
Alcohol can be obtained cheaply and freely in some places. However, intoxication has a detrimental effect on judgement, and every wrongdoer knows how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who is going to be driving at altitude or over mountain passes should consider snow, ice or frost.
On roads with ice and snow there is no grip and you cannot drive as if you were on bare tarmac.
During a snow squall, enough snow will fall in a short time that you will get stuck in it.
You also might not have a clear view with falling snow, or drifting snow, or with water condensing on the vehicle's windows, or ice.
On the other hand, freezing and snowy weather is not usual in many countries, and traffic continues smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest draw for tourists to Africa, and they are a favourite of many visitors.
The word safari, as it is used in everyday speech, means travelling across land to see the exceptional African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and are easily visible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," a "hiking safari," or going "footing") is what's done on a walking safari, for several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, as the games were previously held there in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before they were cancelled, you could be in a bind.
There are different cancellation policies in place, but by the end of March, most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus will not last until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are supposed to be held.
It is expected that most of the tickets for events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a standard ticket costing around ¥7,000.
Damp clothes will dry faster if you iron them. Many hotels will lend you an iron and ironing board, even if there isn't one in the room.
If there is no iron available, or if you don't want to wear ironed stockings, you could use a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful and don't let the iron get too hot (or it might shrink, or, at worst, it will be dyed).
There are different ways to purify water, and some of them are more effective against specific dangers.
In some areas, you only need to boil the water for a minute, in other areas, it needs several minutes.
Seedlings differ in their effectiveness, and if you are concerned, consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with because they do not exist in their own countries.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or worse, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or spread infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing people with their strength, are not usually regarded as pests.
Duty-free shopping, available in some locations, is an opportunity to buy goods on which there are no duties and taxes.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can save a good amount of money, especially on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging section to drive on the highway between Buffalo and Pittsburgh, often going through isolated, wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, always pay attention: there are plenty of steep hills, narrow lanes and bends.
The speed limit is usually not much lower than in the sections before or after – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is more important than it would be elsewhere to adhere to it strictly.
Strangely, however, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than it is in many other places on the road, e.g. rural Pennsylvania.
German pastries are not bad and in Bavaria, they are very rich and there is a variety of them, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, and apples can be found in the pastries year-round, with cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts are also found in many German baked goods. Popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want pastries that are small but rich, try the things called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices together with meat or vegetables.
A corrie can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid that is in it.
Inland in Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
With 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a catch-all term encompassing a vast range of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, this term means that the food originally came from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Japan.
Javanese food is now available throughout the Indonesian islands, and it is characterised by a plethora of simple dishes. Peanuts, coconut milk, sugar (especially coconut sugar from Java itself), and a variety of fragrant spices are the main flavours favoured by the Javanese.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability but there are safety concerns because the rider's legs could get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce the risk, safety precautions can be used.
To begin with, most riders will wear riding boots with heels and a sole that is smooth and quite narrow.
Now, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's main destination for climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America and which has a variety of large granite walls and rocks.
On the summits, amazing views can be seen from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes amongst the endless walls there.
Initially, most riders will wear riding boots with heels and a sole that is smooth and quite narrow.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many dedicated people, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings show skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing has been going on as a sport since at least the 17th century, and the first club for recreational skiing was opened in 1861 by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
He has a penchant for ski touring or alpine-style mountaineering, although these are not usually part of it; these two are done on steep ground and require skis and boots that are much stiffer.
Consider the ski trail as a walking path accordingly.
If the weather is good, you'll cover more distance than you would walking – but you'll rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on tracked trails.
Europe is relatively small as a continent, but it has many independent countries. In a normal situation, where one would travel through many countries, you would need to apply for visas and go through passport controls many times.
The Schengen area, however, operates somewhat like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for visas for each individual country that is a member of Schengen, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There are no universal definitions of what manufactured items constitute an antique. Some tax groups state that goods older than 100 years are an antique.
The definition varies by country, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than it is in Europe.
Handicrafts can be described as antiques, even though they are younger than similar factory-made goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding it is important, also for many other professions.
However, even in their traditional life, not every Sami was involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather in fishing, hunting, or things like that, and they would only have reindeer as working animals.
Many of the Sami work in modern occupations today. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although it is often heard, especially among non-Romani people, “Gypsy” is generally considered an offensive word because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misrepresentation of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel advice, it could affect your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
Perhaps you sought advice from governments other than your own, but the advice is tailored for their own purposes.
For example, American citizens may encounter different issues in the Middle East compared to Europeans or Arabs.
Bulletins are only short summaries of the political situation in a country.
The ideas presented as a meeting are brief, broad and overly simplistic compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather that could cause damage, disruption to society, or loss of life.
Very bad weather can arise anywhere in the world, and there are different kinds of it, which might be according to the shape and nature and connection of the land and the state of the atmosphere.
Strong winds, hailstones, extreme rain and thunderstorms are natures and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts and whirlwinds.
Severe regional and seasonal weather includes blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather in their area as this may affect any travel plans they have.
Anyone considering visiting a country that is potentially considered a war zone should receive professional training.
If you search the internet for information about "Hostile environment training", you might find the address for a local company.
The course tends to run in considerably more detail on every issue discussed here, usually accompanied by practical work.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books that tell you how to survive on the battlefield are common, but there are few publications that deal with life in war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documentation for their return journey.
Governments differ in their willingness to issue passports without gender (X) or renew documents with a different name or gender requested.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize those documents is equally variable.
Security screening at security checkpoints has become much more thorough since September 11, 2001.
A transgender person awaiting surgery and passing through an airport scanner should not expect not to be humiliated and have their private parts exposed to the world.
A rip current is a current of waves that returns from the beach, very often at a reef or something like that.
Due to the underwater topography, most of the return flow is at the bottom of the deeper sections and a fast current may rise towards deep water there.
Most will die from exhaustion as they try to swim back against the current, which could be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it won't be more difficult than usual to swim back.
Look and get somewhere where you won't be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you were noticed, you might be better off waiting for rescue.
Resonance re-emerges quicker than culture shock (there isn't as much delay), it lasts longer and can be more intense.
Sometimes, immigrants who found it easy to adapt to the new culture find it quite difficult to reconnect with their own native culture again.
When you return home after living in a foreign country, you have responded to the new culture and lost some of the customs of home.
When you first went abroad, people were probably quite patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country need time to get used to things.
People might not think that patience and understanding are crucial for tourists who have returned home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You will see the pyramids in the darkness, and you will see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you hear the sound of the tourists and vendors all the way. The sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The sphinx is there as a backdrop and a narrator of a long story.
These scenes will be projected onto the pyramids and different pyramids will be illuminated.
Several countries claim sovereignty over the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and they have the majority of the bases there, with sixteen in use in 2020.
The island is located 120 km north of the Head. The largest island contains a town called Villa Las Estrellas, and it is King George Island.
Others include the Isle of Ballachulish and Foil, where the caldera of a still active volcano lies underwater and forms a wonderful natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the area on the south of the peninsula and is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Heritage Range come together here in the high plateau, and then rise again to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, which is 360 km long and split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest Antarctic mountains are in the north, or Sentinel Range. They are called the Vinson Massif, and the largest is Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones won't completely replace mobile phones in general because you need to be outside in the open and have a clear line of sight to your satellite before you can make a call.
The service is often used by shipping, including ferries, as well as cruise crews who require data and voice communication abroad.
Your local phone company should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for those considering taking a gap year to travel and learn.
School leavers especially appreciate this, as it gives them the opportunity to take a gap year before university without harming their education.
If you sign up for a gap year abroad, this will improve your chances of getting into higher education in your own country in many situations.
Usually, there is a tuition fee to register for these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In island-dotted seas and lochs, a gate isn't necessary.
Although the larger sea inlets and lochs are big enough for any yacht, small boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where one in every seven or eight people owns a boat.
The same thing is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but not outside these countries (e.g. one in forty is the number in the Netherlands).
Most of the cruise ships that deliberately go to the Baltic Sea spend a good amount of time stopping in St Petersburg, Russia.
Therefore, you can visit the historic town for two full days and return to the ship to sleep on it at night.
You will not need a separate visa (from 2009) unless you go ashore other than under the auspices of organised ship tours.
Berlin is in Germany in the brochures for some of the cruises. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and a trip to the city is not included in the price of the cruise at all.
Travelling by plane can be quite frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never been on a plane or have had a challenging experience.
This is not a cause for shame: there is no difference between this and the personal and deep-seated fears that many people have about other things.
For some, if they understand a little about how planes work and what happens during flight, it might help them overcome a fear that is based on ignorance or feeling out of control.
Courier companies can get good money for delivering things quickly. The time it takes is often important when it comes to business documents, goods or parts for urgent repairs.
The biggest companies have their own planes on some routes, but smaller companies were being despised on other routes.
If they sent things by air freight, it could take many days on some routes to get through unloading and customs.
There was no other way to get it through faster than to send it as verified tourist cargo. Airline regulations don't allow them to send their suitcases without a passenger, so this is where you come in.
The usual way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a huge amount of money on it (or, even better, to get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not a cheap option: as a rule of thumb, you would expect a price of up to four times the standard economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, you don't even need to look for discounts on business or first class seats on a direct flight between A and B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of travellers willing to pay a high price to reach a place quickly and in comfort, so airfares are priced accordingly.
Chișinău is the capital of Moldova. Romanian is the local language but many speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this war led to the self-proclamation and creation of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria) in eastern Moldova. It has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member of the United Nations.
Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova, although they failed to reach a compromise in the political sphere.
Orthodox Christianity is the largest religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million people. It is the second largest port city after Istanbul, and it is a good transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, busy and commercial place, situated around a very large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Among the wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centres are traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the town feels more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
Eysturoy island can be seen nearby from the village of Haldarsvík, and it has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, carved marble doves can be found above some of the graves.
You should take half an hour to wander around this quirky town.
To the north of and quite near, is the romantic and impressive town of Sintra, which became famous abroad after Lord Byron wrote a laudatory account of its beauty.
The Scotturb bus 403 goes to Sintra regularly and stops at Cabo da Roca.
North of there, visit the Great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (Shrine), a place of Marian apparitions that is famous worldwide.
Behold and remember that you are visiting a major burial ground and a site of unbelievable significance to many of the world's people.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time spent here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please ensure you treat the site with the respect, solemnity and reverence it deserves. No joking about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking, scratching or writing graffiti on structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. About half the population speaks Catalan as a preference, and the majority of the population understands it, but there is almost no one who does not speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because that is the first official language according to the law.
However, Spanish is often used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements are made in the Metro in Catalan only, but announcements about unplanned service disruptions are made by an automated system in several languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The people of Paris have a bad reputation for being snobbish, impolite and proud.
Even though this is often not the whole truth about the city, the best way to get in with the people of Paris is to be very polite, and to convince them that you are a "bien élevé" person (well-bred). This will make it much easier to travel around the city.
The people of Paris will soon stop being so abrupt if you follow one or two basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is situated under a large forest, which contains common birch, spruce and pine trees and where there is a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a great wealth of distinctive plant communities due to the microclimates, the different soils and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to a variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and capercaillie can be found there, alongside many that are more common.
When women visit the monasteries, they must wear skirts that cover the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries will give bonnets to women who come without one, but if you bring one with you, especially one in bright colours, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the door.
Also, the men must wear trousers that cover the knee.
That can also be borrowed from the store at the entrance, but that clothing isn't washed after each person, and you might not be comfortable putting those skirts on. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Majorca, like the cuisines of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout the food.
People are fond, especially in the summer, of a simple dinner called Pa amb Oli, that is bread with olive oil, tomato, and any other available topping such as cheese, tuna, and so on.
Every noun, including the word Sie for you, always starts with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between some verbs and objects.
You could argue that it makes reading easier, although the writing is a bit more complex because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective is being used in its nominalized form.
The sounds of Italian are reasonably easy because most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
C and G are the letters that most need attention, because their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
Also, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: *caro* means dear/expensive but *carro* means vehicle/carriage.
Persian grammar is quite easy and regular.
Therefore, if you read this primer, you would learn a lot about Persian grammar and you would have a better understanding of the expressions.
It's unnecessary to say that you'll find it easier to learn Portuguese if you have a Romance language.
However, it can happen that people with a little Spanish decide too quickly that Portuguese is close enough and that they don't need to learn it on its own.
There is no need for overly modern observatories usually today, and they are now museums or learning centres.
Since light pollution wasn't a problem when they were at their peak as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to reach than those built today.
Most telescopes, situated in remote corners with favourable atmospheric conditions, are large, expensive resources.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor would only hold private cherry blossom viewing parties for himself and the other nobles around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so don't be tempted to remove even "just one" example.
If you visit a formal garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect "specimens".
Singapore is usually a very safe place and it is very easy to find your way around and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But because you will be in the "high tropics" just a step or two north of the equator, you have to endure the heat (constantly) and strong sun (when there are no clouds, which is not so common).
There are some buses also going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you see is going to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement, Kiryat Arba.
The country's waters can be a good topic to base a holiday tour around.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire valley, the Rhine valley or taking a boat trip to interesting towns on the Danube river or across the Erie canal.
In addition to this, they mark popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world have adopted many customs associated with the holiday.
There is a custom of keeping vigil through Easter night in a place that faces the sunrise.
It is known that Christian theological descriptions of this custom can be found, but it is just as likely to be a Spring and Fertility rite from pre-Christian times.
More traditional churches will hold the Easter Vigil on Saturday night, usually at the end of Easter weekend, with the congregation often beginning the celebration quickly when midnight arrives to mark the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals originally reached these islands by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, and that left the giant tortoise as the main grazing animal in the Galápagos.
Since people went to the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you take a trip to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will see the polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day.
Because only a small population lives in the areas and because there is very little light pollution as a result, you will have the opportunity to enjoy the stars.
It is likely that the Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than people in the West are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Teamwork in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasises group efforts rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get approval from their managers for any decisions they make, and they are expected to comply with the directions of the managers without question.
