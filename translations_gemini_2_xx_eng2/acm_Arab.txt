Using the PALM trial, they used the drug ZMapp as a control standard, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.

The topic doesn't just confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a common theory, but it goes beyond that by providing details that fossils generally can't, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and pale or the same color as carotenoids on the underside.
The discovery also provides a deep understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not possess a fully developed bony structure called a "vertebral column," but do possess other feather characteristics - such as barbs and barbules - researchers concluded that the vertebral column was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
Based on the appearance of the wings' structure, it seems they weren't used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers suggest that even though this tail belongs to a small dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers and not the rear end of a small dinosaur.
The researchers pointed out that although this tail is from a small dinosaur, the sample showed feathers of a mature bird and not a small dinosaur.

As for the work completed, most of it is theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations that were recorded from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for is attributed to tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way galaxy attracts the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were troubled by the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter affects it.
That theory explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy forms around it in what resembles a halo, and it is composed of tiny particles in large numbers.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
And he stated in an interview that the new changing form of bacteria is "alarming and extremely terrifying due to the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Mull believes that some patients, including two hospital employees, likely contracted the virus inside the hospital.
Within one year, one infected person can infect between 10 to 15 of their close contacts.
Nevertheless, the percentage of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) out of the total TB-infected population remains small; for example, in South Africa, 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people are affected at any given time.

It's colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer than it at night.
Their thermal behavior isn't stable like large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it's consistent with them being deep holes in the ground, as Glenn Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University based in Flagstaff, Arizona, said.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech affair: voters isolate themselves in a booth, take a pre-printed ballot, and mark their preferred candidate's name on an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law severely restricts unpopular measures.
And since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no ballots at the beginning of voting, and that no one will add ballots except for the ballots of registered voters who are duly authorized and commissioned.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor every part of the process. And at night, the votes are sorted by volunteers under intense supervision, following specific procedures.

This thing is absolutely not logical; and of course, it's not fair.
All I tell people is that you must treat us the way we treat you.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill banning the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The draft law stipulates placing an "18+" sticker on violent video games sold in California, and penalizes selling them to minors with a fine of $1000 per offense.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, made a statement this morning announcing the trial of both Huhne and Pryce.
Huhne resigned and will be replaced on the Cabinet by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take over the business secretary job being vacated by Davey.
Heuhan and Price are scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
Among the losses were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Kudeback, 21 years old. Kudeback was the driver.
Edgar Figuella sustained arm and jaw injuries, while Christopher Schneider required reconstructive surgery to his face.
Schneider suffers from persistent pain, blindness in one eye, and the loss of a part of his skull. His face was reconstructed with titanium, all due to the failure of an "Oka" weapon while it was aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider gave his testimony via a video link from a US Air Force base in his home country.
After the Wednesday event, Karbanidu competed in two individual races at the championship.
Her first ever race was a slalom race, where she got a "Did Not Finish" result in her first run. And 36 out of 116 competitors got the same result in that race.
In her other event - the giant slalom - she finished tenth in the women's sitting category with a total running time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Claudia Loesch of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers on the disabled team failed to finish their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 female skiers in the giant slalom failed to achieve a ranking in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
According to Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kangar, Butha Kanga, Rampro Kangar, Ghaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
But the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision happened has been temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT car.
Initially, they admitted him to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then they transferred him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been accused in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh of killing her son.
She is currently in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony might be questionable because her picture has been widely circulated.
This is a widespread practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have considered that publishing photos could be seen as prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it seems that journalists are definitely heading in a dangerous direction if they publish pictures or things like that related to suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, indicated to reporters that there would be no further comments until at least after the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 war borders in the Middle East.
Other topics reportedly covered included the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered an important issue for both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel is constantly demanding a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to this presence continuing for only five years.
The guards had to provide strong supervision of those released on a supplementary pest control trial, and the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership between the "National Parks and Wildlife Service" and the "Sporting Shooters Association of Australia," they selected qualified volunteers within the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) parks and heritage conservation organization, the four hunters who were selected for the first hunt received safety and comprehensive training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new interim electoral council composed of nine members.
This is the fifth temporary electoral council for Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the dismissal of the interim electoral council as part of a series of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was essentially a Martelly response to the widespread demonstrations rejecting the regime that began in October.
Demonstrations, sometimes violent, erupted due to the failure to hold the elections proposed to be conducted since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of overheating iPod devices were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional cases of heat exhaustion, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry responded to the call to postpone Apple's report by saying it was "truly unfortunate."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office stated that no damage to the country has been reported.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there are no indications of a possible tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M-16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children, elderly people, and Filipino photographers, were quickly released.
Then the photographers took the place of an old lady because she wanted to go to the toilet. And Mendoza was shot.
He followed in his father's footsteps and took up medicine as a profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist, then was appointed to Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth during his free time, while working at the hospital.
And he showed through his research that if you give a certain hormone, it will accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the flight recorder, also known as the "black box," on Wednesday.
Luna received praise from her colleagues.
Cole Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first hardcore queen. My first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons. A strong woman, one of a kind."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented and said: "Luna was eccentric like me... and maybe even more than me... I loved her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced during the 2010 federal election campaign that she envisioned Australia becoming a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those included in the survey agree with this point of view, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
Regarding the opposite ends of the spectrum in the poll, 29% of those surveyed said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist's physical fitness has become questionable due to his complaining, as he was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn't take the medications he needed as pain relief because their use is prohibited in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computational science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several individuals verified the discovery using different devices and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source for delivering water to Earth, in addition to organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed from the collision of comets with the Earth a long time ago.
Andrew Cuomo, 53 years old, prematurely resigned this year, and signed a bill into law last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
He is likely to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system the Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
She's using satellite-based technology, unlike the old technology that used ground radar, to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft location with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more specific information.
There's no additional transportation, and the underground trains won't stop at Wembley, in addition to the unavailability of car garages and park and ride facilities on the ground.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have raised the possibility of holding the match behind closed doors, without any fans present.
A study published in the journal "Science" on Thursday mentioned the emergence of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the evolution of new species took only two generations - even though it was believed that this process takes much longer - due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, the immigrant cactus finch, and the sharp-beaked ground finch.
It is possible to shape gold into various forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
And it can be drawn into a thin wire that can be coiled and braided. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made extremely thin and stuck to another metal. It can become so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books they call "illuminated manuscripts".
It is called the pH number of the chemical substance, and you can use red cabbage juice as an indicator for this number.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
We need to mix the dry powders together, then squeeze them with clean, wet hands until they form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers [of something], and this will give you a strange feeling and form a sort of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, there were toilets with a drainage mechanism in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would enter together in mixed-gender areas.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost instantaneously.
The satellite is sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the vision.
We need a giant rocket, taller than 100 feet (30 meters), to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
Wheels (tires) have changed the world in an amazing way; however, their most important contribution to us remains providing an easier and faster means of transportation.
She was the reason for the invention of the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
And below them in the hierarchy, there are more mid-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits and lambs to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of status; a specific function for each cat that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called herds.
A lion pride consists of one to three adult males, in addition to approximately 35 females and cubs.
Usually, the females are closer to each other, because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
The pride of lions behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly, animals similar to the lion (but not other big cats) share this behavior and are very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the lion's roar in its full sound, but it's closer to screaming with angry words.
The dwarf tiger cat likes to eat animals smaller than itself, and it hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the dwarf tiger cat hunts are smaller than it in size.
Scientists believe that dwarf tiger animals track and find animals to eat (prey) by using their sense of smell; they smell where they are located on the ground.
You can see well in the dark using night vision and move very quietly. Dwarf tigerfish hunt their prey through camouflage and their surroundings, and then they pounce on them.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they belong to (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island such that they cannot return easily), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the environment they were in before.
Given that this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the newly formed group will need different properties or ways of adapting in order to become a stronger competitor compared to what strength it needed previously.
There hasn't been any change to the indigenous population at all, because they still require the same adaptation methods as we've gotten used to them.
Over time, as the new inhabitants adapt to their new environment, their resemblance to the other inhabitants gradually diminishes.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will appear so different that we won't be able to call them the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis and provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything, except other Mosasaurs.
It had long jaws with over 70 blade-like teeth, plus a second set at the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that stood in its way.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he was probably a carnivore.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't compare.
Despite most of their food not being foreign to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual dishes for feasts, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food sitting on benches, rich men liked to hold feasts together and recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's house.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to fulfill the gods' needs during occasions and holidays.
Every temple has an open courtyard, and from it, you go to a secluded and safe sanctuary that only the priests can enter.
And sometimes, unique towers were built in the shape of pyramids, and they were called ziggurats, so that they would be part of the temples.
The top of the ziggurat was a safe haven for the god.
Given the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of great importance.
Most of the Arab family's life was spent outdoors.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; and the shops were just open kiosks facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There weren't big forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was expensive.
Humans inhabited Greenland sparsely. According to stories in the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he reached Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there previously.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in the countries of "Denmark," "Sweden," "Norway," and "Iceland," even though they are all "Scandinavian" countries.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you probably think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But this thing is not correct. Even though there is something on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
The phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears at the bottom of the document, reversed.
Although the author of this part of the text is not precisely known, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches "75.5cm" × 24½ inches "62.2cm") was folded and stored at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it's most likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the battles that followed led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still not liberated.
France was ruled by "Vichy." They were a group of French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies occupied southern France and called the invasion "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The origin of the word "civilization" is from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil," which is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and this also defines it in terms of a societal mass.
Autonomous city-states are like the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture inherently means the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Minor cultures often fade away without leaving any real historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 colonies initially formed a weak central government - with Congress being its only element - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition to that, you do not have the authority to override the tax laws and tariffs imposed between states.
The articles required unanimous approval by all states before they could be amended, and the states mocked the central government to the point that most of its representatives were absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is considered the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan includes approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to - from a geographical perspective - as an "archipelago".
Taiwan began its journey back in the 15th century, and European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the standard format for still photography known worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Its production continued after it until this day, but more importantly, the aspect ratio of digital camera image sensors inherited it.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this image, when divided by 12 to get the ratio in its simplest whole number form, will be 3:2.
This aspect ratio is equal to or close to many common formats (e.g., the Advanced Photo System format group).
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and constantly ridiculed, forms a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in a clear manner.
It is mentioned that the most impactful location for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity tied European countries together for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
The overwhelming power I possessed affected everyone, from the king down to the common people.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the church resided in Rome, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question the extent to which its adherence to the tenets of faith remained steadfast.
Britain quickly moved to blockade Germany by sea after the outbreak of the skirmishes.
The strategy proved its effectiveness by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law as codified and formalized in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the oceans, and this threatened even neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected the same reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the countries wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each era of China or each family in power was of a different nature.
In addition to this, there was, between each ruling dynasty, an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, a fierce war broke out between many nobles who wanted to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battle for the highest positions in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just the ruler alone.
And after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to prosper.
The same applies to the army because, somewhere along the line, the army's rankings, which used to be based on class, started to depend on standards.
The French Revolution also inspired a wave of other oppressed working-class people in other countries to ignite their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that transcended this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on top of Mount "al-Nour" for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has remained throughout the ages, offers a very vivid picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
And in truth, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists. And once you enter the cave, you'll be in complete isolation.
And you can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky above the many mountains surrounding the place. And it's impossible to see or hear more than very little of this world inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza Governorate is considered the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is considered one of the massive pyramids built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" symbol will appear like the letter V, and the "down-bow" symbol will appear like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
An upper mark means you have to start from the edge and push the bow, while a lower mark means that you have to start from the end of the bow (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull it.
Typically, the upper bow produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is more powerful and assertive.
Feel free to pencil in your own markings, but remember that the printed curved markings are there for a musical reason, so you should usually respect them.
Frightened, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (Marie Therese, who was 11 years old, and Louis Charles, who was four years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a large crowd of people who were shouting and chanting against the King and Queen.
A group of fans managed to force the King and Queen to fully open the windows of their car.
At some point, a member of the gangs waved the head of a slain member of the Royal Guard at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The Filipino people bore the costs of the United States of America's imperialist war through its invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Naturally, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will form the core profits of American imperialism.
We must understand the context that motivated the creation of the organization, so that we can comprehend the Knights Templar.
The era in which these events took place was known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which altogether end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two general ideas shared by most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology, in turn, has inherent "effects" on societies, rather than being linked to society.
For example, someone might say that the car engine necessarily leads to road development.
However, building a road network across the country isn't considered economically viable for a small number of cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning cars collectively also contributes to a higher rate of traffic accidents, and this leads to the innovation of new healthcare technologies to treat damaged bodies.
Romance had a significant element of cultural determinism derived from books by figures like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture connected to this geography were formed. These people, being in harmony with the place of their community, were considered better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Paris is famous for being the capital of fashion in the modern world, while Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Her fame came from being a center of luxury, starting in the year 400 AD and continuing until the year 1100 AD.
Her situation deteriorated during the twelfth century due to the fact that the Crusades returned with gifts like silk and spices, which were of higher value than what the Byzantine markets were offering.
And at this time, the title "Capital of Affection" was given to Paris instead of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture in the Levant significantly influenced clothing.
Despite this, and due to the slowness of communication channels, trends are delayed in the West by approximately 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, resulting from the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is the farming that is done to produce enough food to only meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming - which is often organic - is a simple system that uses saved seeds that are suited to the region's ecosystem, in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, with the aim of increasing yield.
Historically, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are likely to be distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture's distinctiveness can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership through a distinct and conventional use of style that includes clothing, mannerisms, and jargon.
Among the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is relying on the unfortunate, rare cases of children who suffered, through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, being unsocialized by adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some stray children are locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child was abandoned because the parents rejected the child's severe mental or physical disability.
It's possible that feral children were subjected to bad treatment during childhood or severe traumas before being abandoned or escaping.
And others are alleged to have been raised by animals; and it is said that some of them lived in the wilderness alone.
When raised by animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limitations) that closely resemble those of their particular animal caregivers, such as fear of humans or a general lack of concern.
While project-based learning should make education easier and more interesting, the support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of teaching, but rather an aid that provides support for individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive education can be virtual or in person, and to put it another way, a teacher is a form of interactive education, as is the paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported within the program and aims to pose questions, stimulate, and explain procedures that are difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment not based on upbringing, care, and education, but unfortunately, that's what happens to these children.
We know that the alternative care system is considered a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
You need to provide alternative care with all the necessities they lacked in the homes they left previously.
The internet combines elements of public and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" as novel motivational aspects for those who studied public response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions, which are facial movements that last for fractions of a second.
It is specifically claimed that one can discover whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper that the President's speech indicates that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
And he proposes the idea that these abilities, involving the analysis of human behavior, are shared with some animals, like domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research revealed the existence of two groups of genetic variations: a recessive group and a dominant group.
Mutation introduces new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variation.
The processes of separation and recombination cause the difference to become randomly exchanged back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Failure in this matter will lead to dire consequences: growth stunting, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easily accessible plant resources that were abundant were proteins that could be obtained from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if uncooked.
Conversely, animal-based foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide proteins in high quantities and contain all essential amino acids.
Taking everything into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors somehow solved the "protein problem" in their own way, similar to how chimpanzees do it in the savanna.
Sleep interruption is the deliberate act of waking up during your natural sleep period and going back to sleep after a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
It is possible to do this easily by using a relatively quiet alarm so that you return to consciousness without being fully woken up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you should put it on the other side of the room, and this will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options, based on biological systems, include drinking a hobby of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to wake up from bed and go to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less stress you have, the more positivity you gain, which gives you the strength of life. Every person possesses the inherent ability to find peace and complete contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us on the path to this goal is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everyone.
Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America, but with the end of the war, the clash of systems, procedures, and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
This war was supposed to last for the next forty years, with fighting on the ground carried out by proxy armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union, forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, entered after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is considered the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Tradition dictates that the function of naval forces is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, and at the same time, to obstruct your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to counter this invasion, and its strength was through the use of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have likely proceeded to invade Britain, just like it did with the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them because of the ease of obtaining milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were raised in herds that grazed on the hills or other grazing areas, and they were often herded by goat herders, most of whom were children or teenagers, similar to the widely known shepherd. And these grazing methods are still used to this day.
Wagon roads were established in England as far back as the 16th century.
Despite the fact that the ancient railway wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them, achieving greater speeds and hauling larger loads compared to the roads, which were considered much more rugged at that time.
Railway rails were invented relatively early to stabilize the tracks, but it later became clear over time that placing a strip of iron on top of the track made it more effective.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused further wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Ultimately, the wooden tires were replaced with iron tires. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation, humans began walking upright two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning the upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright consistently.
Bipedal species have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms with a fan in many cases. However, if we only want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems, and we must solve them.
It's clear that the world has changed a lot because of humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have become bigger because of the population increase and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few buildings away to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as "Dunlap Cash Handbills."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Hall Square on July 8th.
A copy of it was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy of it arrived in London on August 10th.
The twenty-five Dunlap broadsides represent the oldest surviving copies of the document of the American Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version is lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that a single group of dinosaurs survived and still exists to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things related to birds that resemble dinosaurs.
It has two legs with layers of outer protection and claws, it lays eggs, and walks on its hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
Virtually all computer devices used today rely on processing encrypted information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1. These digits are referred to as binary digits - or bits, if we use computer terminology.
It's possible that the symptoms of internal poisoning don't appear immediately. An immediate diagnosis might not be possible when symptoms like vomiting appear, which are general enough.
A possible good indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label to familiarize yourself with the specific first aid instructions for the particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from the old knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both "assassin bugs" and "bed bugs" are characterized by a long incubation period and are adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it one of the most prevalent neurological diseases among young adults and those of middle age.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as males.
A couple might decide that it's not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child to raise a baby.
It's possible these couples will be chosen to create an adoption plan for their children.
In the adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that other couples can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Despite this, it is not unique in this field; rather, conducting experiments is considered a test that can be used to refute one or more of the possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including matters of psychology, were accepted.
While knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend decisively, in many instances, on the existence of self-sustained cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including the specific periodic rhythms of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to introduce their DNA into bacteria.
Perform two labeling experiments, either labeling its DNA using radioactive phosphorus or its protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations can only be passed on to children through germline cells, while mutations in other places can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done on-site include: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting Borneo to photograph and learn information about this type of ape (orangutans).
Every morning, people leave the small towns in their cars and go to their workplaces, encountering on the way people who work at the place they just left.
Through this vibrant mode of transportation, everyone supports and is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems. Everyone complains about the transportation systems.
You rarely hear about developed countries having similar levels of complaints regarding water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why are there so many complaints about the transportation systems, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are the transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and private cars between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent manner; therefore, traffic flow has a reasonable consistency and can be expressed mathematically in an approximate way.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three key characteristics: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings along the length of their body.
This gives them a larger array of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people saw that his words were correct, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This sounds logical because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, reaching a width of up to 6 miles (9.6 km) at times.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the continued construction of stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, nothing has surpassed the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and artistic excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians were amazed by the New Kingdom at the monuments of their ancestors, which were built over a thousand years ago.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and has the lowest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a language of daily life used by most state workers, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times. It was possible to discover all these elements in nature in their original form, and they could be extracted relatively easily using rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle supposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also hypothesized that they transform into new materials until they form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. And don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And of course, there are also minerals like silver and gold.
It's also possible to get alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe was created from matter. And all matter was created from small particles called atoms.
Atoms are very small, so much so that trillions of them could occupy the space of the dot at the end of this sentence.
And then, the pencil was a good friend to a hobby for many people since it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and fewer uses.
People nowadays write letters on computer screens, without needing to use a stylus.
One can't help but wonder about the fate of keyboards when a newer invention comes out.
The principle of a fission bomb's operation is based on accumulating energy until a nucleus is formed that is filled with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart uphill. The nucleus disintegrates again, and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to disintegrate with little or no prompting.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner in the lower areas and thicker in the highlands.
There might be many lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to come to the surface.
Most content theories revolve around finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that emerge spontaneously when they reach puberty.
These theories explore what motivates some people to desire the things they do, and the aspects of their surrounding environment that cause them to do or not do certain things.
The two most well-known theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when people see managers being led by their former peers, and one of them is trying to remain "like the others" (or the other women).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, conduct performance reviews, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable.
From another perspective, the individual transforms into a completely different person who feels obligated to change everything the team was doing and owns them.
Ultimately, the leader is primarily responsible for the success and failure of the team.
And this behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
And they often have greater autonomy than members of traditional teams because their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a real "hidden team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) has been described as a unique component of a hypothetical team.
Each member submits their reports to the management team, the "Invisible Team," which sets the standards for each member.
Why does the organization want to establish an educational organization with a process that consumes a long time? Innovation is considered one of the goals of implementing institutional learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can be achieved.
As a result of this, synergy within the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of new, innovative procedures that meet customer needs.
Before the organization is capable of innovation, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience data provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach to knowledge inquiry, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise as a hobby.
Research supports scientists in correlating brain pathology with behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain cognitive functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in a way we haven't seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has strong science fiction connotations, it represents a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves building machines to automatically perform all tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, preparing schedules, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and in addition to this, recognition of handwriting, voice, and faces.
These things became separate fields focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Today, artificial intelligence systems are used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being used to build several software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are considered a big part of any class. And often, a teacher might like to take her students to places where going there by bus isn't possible.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Also, sharing a virtual field trip is a nice way to relive a specific trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website explaining their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but they keep the old versions online to serve as a record.
Forums can help improve students' writing. When students share their experiences in forums with imperfect grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Given that students are often the most critical audience, the writer in the forum strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Additionally, forums "force students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to feed public interest inspires students to become skilled and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Writing in forums is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend the scope of learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of forums can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; and through effective response to online materials, students can position themselves within the context of others' writings, in addition to defining their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and includes a collection of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is located in the far south, and in the north lies the beautiful, untapped House of Nature in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as being considered by outsiders as quintessentially Canadian.
The large areas in the north are relatively sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited.
For the sake of comparison regarding population figures that astonish many: The number of African Americans residing in the United States of America is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar Island is the largest of all, and it's an independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent states, or affiliated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs carried Islam to the land, and it spread widely in the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the fifteenth century, but the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
From the north, the African coast borders the region, and it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean from the south and west.
Women: It's better for women to declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
And it's helpful to wear a ring (but not the type that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they may consider harassment or something unfamiliar, such as stalking, or someone grabbing their hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stick to your position (cultural differences don't make this acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port named "Anfa" after it was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca," and they abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it Dar al-Baida, and Spanish merchants called it Casablanca and established trading posts there.
Casablanca is considered one of the least exciting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods all over the old city, like tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and all kinds of cheap products, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed due to lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Despite "Goma" being relatively safe, it's necessary to confirm before making any visits outside of "Goma", to understand the ongoing fighting situation in the North Kivu province.
The city is considered a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can take a "boda-boda" (which is basically a motorcycle used as a taxi) to get around Goma, and the usual price (locally) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
In addition to being relatively difficult to reach, Timbuktu became used as a passage for distant and exotic lands.
The city of Timbuktu is considered a poor city in our present time, despite its reputation that makes it a tourist attraction, in addition to having an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates in his PBS series about the African world wonders special.
The city differs markedly from the rest of the country's cities, as it has a more Arab character than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, extending along the Mozambique border to the east and the Zimbabwe border to the north, and is bordered by the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is considered one of the most attractive regions in South Africa and a major park of the South African National Parks.
There are daily wages for maintaining the park and entering it, similar to all national parks in South Africa.
It might be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, because it allows you entry to a selected group of South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is the place many tourists consider their destination.
The rows of buildings resemble the Hong Kong skyline in a vibrant chart rising above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers used as a place for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal belt of mangrove forests in the world, stretching for 80 kilometers (50 miles) in the remote coastal regions of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; because they contain some of the last remaining evidence of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges River plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 square kilometers, almost a third of which is covered by water/swamps.
From 1966 onwards, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it's estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those heading east towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Because the buses that go between regions are usually packed, it's best to buy tickets in advance a few days prior.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to get around nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, their length reaches 378 meters, and they have two sides that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance inside the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, coinciding with the expected completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. The Guarani people lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes like the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay emerged, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," as a result of a confrontation between Spanish invaders and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year will be held in December at the Polo Plus Canitas fields.
In addition to this, you can watch smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and where to buy polo match tickets, follow the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the pound sterling (GBP).
Could you please exchange the money at the only bank in the island, which is located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store?
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and the American dollar is accepted most of the time.
On remote islands, there's a chance they don't accept credit cards, although they might accept British Pounds and US Dollars; you need to ask the owners beforehand to know the accepted payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so you need to exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, the summer season there coincides with the winter season in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; therefore, it's natural for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
The winter will probably be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine, making it feel colder than the number shown on the thermometer.
The amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year, and there aren't specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Even though many of the animals in the zoo are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild animals in the end, and we shouldn't give them food or bother them.
As per park authorities' instructions, you must stay at least 100 yards (91 meters) away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (23 meters) away from all other wild animals!
No matter how much docility they display, bison, deer, moose, and bears, and almost all large animals, are capable of attacking.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, ferocious, and considered a source of danger, so we must give them their space.
In addition to that, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so try not to take or cook foods that have a strong smell, and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and was the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
The port was the site of infamous naval clashes in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German people drowned.
During the struggle organized by the Mau Mau movement for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of High Chief Tubua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is located between two harbors, it has many beaches, with the most popular ones being in three areas.
The shores of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by butakwa trees.
The shores of Tāmaki Drive are located on the Waitematā Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are often crowded and have a nice selection of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The basic popular beer is known as "Number One," it's not a complex drink, but rather a pleasant and refreshing one. Another local beer is called "Manta."
French wine varieties are numerous, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more widely distributed.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is an "espresso", while a cappuccino has a layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent, although they are expensive.
There are many trips to the coral reefs throughout the year, and coral damage rarely occurs due to any of these reasons.
Nevertheless, seek advice from the authorities, pay attention to all signs, and safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are abundant near the shores and river mouths from October to April north of 17°70'. And sometimes they can be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles don't usually live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Making a reservation assures the traveler that they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Although you might find that it's possible to book other forms of accommodation, like campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with specific hotels.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even bundled packages that include flights and hotels.
They can keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or complete other documents for your travel (for example, the visa).
Despite this, you must make any changes or requests through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp at the location, considering it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get in early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages might be over, there are sections of the festival that will continue playing music until late at night.

During snowstorms, a sufficient amount of snow can fall to impede your progress within a very short period of time.
The visibility can be limited by snowfall, icy winds, condensation, or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic usually continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari trips may be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The term "safari" is usually used to refer to traveling across countries to see the amazing wildlife in Africa, especially in the savanna.

The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, and it regularly passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you're used to driving on rural roads, you need to be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is very important.
It's strange that the mobile network coverage is better here than in many other areas along the way, for example, the forests of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are very delicious, and in the state of Bavaria they are very rich and diverse, similar to the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.

Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines spread across Indonesia, due to the existence of 17,000 islands in Indonesia, making comparison between them difficult.
However, if it's used without additional terms, the meaning of the term is closer to saying that the food originates from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago islands, Javanese cuisine features a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the prevalent flavors favored by Javanese people being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are considered supports for the rider's legs, hanging down on the sides of the saddle.
And it provides more stability for the scafold, but it has safety concerns because of the possibility that the scafold's legs might break.
If a rider falls off a horse and their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, the horse might drag them if it runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
Firstly, most horse riders wear riding boots that have a heel, a soft sole, and are very tight.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the rider's leathers to slip off the saddle if they are dragged by the stirrup during a fall.

When the conditions are good, you will be able to cover longer distances than walking to some extent, but you will rarely reach the speeds of long-distance skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
Despite that, the Schengen area is considered to some extent as a single state in this regard.
As long as you (plural) are staying in this area, you can generally cross the borders without needing to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply separately for a visa for each member state of Schengen, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
Some agencies exempt taxes on artifacts, defining them as goods older than one hundred years, but there is no comprehensive definition of what we consider to be artifacts from manufactured items.

The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies greatly.
Security checkpoint searches became significantly more invasive of privacy, especially after 9/11 (September 11th, 2001).
Transgender people before surgery shouldn't have to expect to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being maintained.
Rip currents are the backflow from waves that break on the shore, often near coral reefs or in a nearby location.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow concentrates in a series of deep sections, potentially forming a fast deep-water current there.
Most deaths happen due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, and this is almost impossible.
Once you swim outside the current, swimming back will be as easy as usual.
Try to aim for a place where the current is carrying you, either to the bank or, depending on your skills or if someone sees you. Otherwise, your second option is to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock happens faster than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more intense.

The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, including Vinson Massif, whose peak reaches a height of 4892 meters, Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, with the absence of mobile network coverage, a satellite phone (Thuraya) might be the only option.
A Thuraya phone isn't considered a substitute for a mobile phone because you have to be standing outside and there needs to be a clear line of sight with the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used in maritime services, including recreational boats and exploration expeditions that have data and voice needs remotely.
There needs to be a local phone service provider that can offer more information about how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning are considered a more common option for people planning a gap year.
This is considered popular, especially among people who have completed their schooling, and it allows them to take a year off before joining university without jeopardizing their education.

Shipping companies are paid well to deliver mail quickly. Time is usually very important for official documents, goods, and spare parts for urgent repairs.
The larger companies have their own private planes, with some routes, but there's a problem for the other routes and smaller companies.
If they send the mail by air freight, it might be delayed a few days on some routes due to unloading and customs.
Sending mail as checked baggage was the only way to get it delivered quickly, but the internal regulations of airlines don't allow sending baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The intuitive way to be able to travel in first class or business class is to allocate a large sum of money to obtain this privilege (or, better yet, to have your company do it).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a general rule, expect to pay about four times the cost of regular economy for business class, and 11 times for first class!
Generally speaking, it's no use looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there's a specific core group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to a certain place quickly and comfortably, and they are treated accordingly.

The more traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil service on Saturday during Easter weekend, and congregations often begin celebrating the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came either by swimming, flying, or floating.
