This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers like birds, a theory already supported, but also provides details that fossils normally cannot give, such as color and a three-dimensional representation.
Scientists say that the feathers of these animals were chestnut-brown at the tips, with a hint of orange on the inside.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs had a significantly developed calamus, called the rachis, but other types of feathers called barbs and barbules, it occurred to researchers that the rachis was the result of a more recent development in the evolution of these other feathers.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flying, but for regulating temperature and displaying to other animals. The researchers say that even though this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of a large bird, not a small one.

In France, voting has always been a low-tech experience: those who vote isolate themselves in a booth, and put a pre-printed paper indicating their choice of candidate into an envelope.
After the officials check the identity of the person voting, this person puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures.
From 1988 onwards, the ballot box had to be transparent, so that voters and observers could see that there were no envelopes already inside from the beginning, and that no envelope was added gradually, other than those counted and authorized as appropriate.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, with specific procedures.

In the other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's 'seated group' with a total race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth, the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers from the women's sit-ski group failed to finish the race, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen computer and telephone.
The Inspector General D K Arya said: "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her computer and phone."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite three people being inside the house when the car crashed into it, nobody was injured.
Anyway, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya is then in the sheriff court of Edinburgh accused of the murder of her son.
He is under arrest awaiting the indictment and trial, but any eyewitness could be compromised because his image has been highly publicized.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts viewed the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that "it seems that journalists are crossing a dangerous line by publishing photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is fully responsible for the prosecution, indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made until at least the indictment.
The document, according to the tip-off, speaks of the border dispute, which wants Palestine based on the borders before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other issues probably addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is finalized, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary disinfestation process had to be carefully supervised by the rangers, while the process was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were taken on, in the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Conservation and Heritage of the Park with NPWS, the four deer taken in the first shooting operation received full safety instruction and training.
Martelly was sworn in to join a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) formed by nine councilors yesterday.
It's the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country to elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the inability to organize the elections, some of which were supposed to be held in 2011.
About 60 cases of defective iPods overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said he knew of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, Meta announced that Apple had informed them of 34 other overheating incidents that the company called "not serious."
The minister responded, defining Apple's referral of the report as "very unpleasant."
The earthquake shook the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time in the morning (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage in the nation.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that no tsunami signals were seen.
A Filipino man, formerly a policeman, kidnapped tourists from Hong Kong by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages were recovered, and for the time being, at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, from whom the children and the elderly were released first, including the Filipino photographers.
Afterwards, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed the same path as his father, working in medicine.
He specialized as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor during his free time.
His research proved that administering a hormone accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs of the baby.
Xinhua said that government investigators found the two flight recorders "black boxes" on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Unique like her. A strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was crazy like me... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... maybe she's in a better place.”
Of the 1400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34 percent of those interviewed think the same, that they want Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those questioned believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his well-being was called into question.
I couldn't take the medicines that I needed to relieve the pain because they are banned by the Games.
On June 25th, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software from the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water distribution on Earth, along with other organic materials that form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed when comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his governorship at the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He called the back alleys "Political chatter and foolishness."
It is thought that he/she/they will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of liters of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike the old ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
They are not putting on other transport and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley and the car parks and interchange facilities will not be available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the match would be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science discussed the birth of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have stated that the new species evolved in two generations, despite this process normally taking longer, due to reproduction between a Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, and the large cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any kind of shape. It can be hammered into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin threads, then it can be turned and twisted. It can be beaten or worked into thin sheets.
It can become very thin, and placed on other metals. It can become so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical product tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together and then, with dry and clean hands, form a ball.
The moisture from the hands reacts with the outer layers, which become strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of plumbing systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets also in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is miles and kilometers away, the signal transmission happens through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it downwards, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
It takes a giant rocket taller than 100 feet (30 meters) to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel did for us is to provide easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and other means of transportation.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats that eat prey of medium size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Then, there are many small cats (including house cats) that eat much more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to her success is the niche concept, a special skill that each cat has that keeps her away from competition with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
Harems are composed of one to three adult and related males, along with up to thirty females and young ones.
The women are usually related to each other, because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Honey badgers behave very much like wolves or dogs, animals that resemble the lion (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are very deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger knows how to climb (even if not well), swim, make big jumps, and lift up to five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but like a sentence of angry and shouted words.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. It hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They see very well in the dark with their night vision, and they move very silently too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and then jumping on the prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they come (like if they go beyond a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island and therefore cannot easily return) they often find themselves in an environment different from the one where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was needed before.
The original population didn't change at all, they need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they start to resemble the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations become so different that it can no longer be said that they are of the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (which means release with their breath).
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses with plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food that we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaurus was a top predator of its time, and the only thing that could scare it were other mosasaurs.
The long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth, plus others on the palate, meaning that there was no way for whatever got caught to escape.
It's not certain, but it could have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, it's possible they were cannibals.
He was quick to attack anything that entered the water; even a dinosaur as big as a T. rex couldn't do anything against him.
Even though we could recognize almost everything that the Romans ate, the Romans also held banquets that might seem a bit strange to us: they ate wild boar, turkeys, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate seated on chairs, the rich men liked to hold feasts together where they reclined on a platform while eating their meals.
The ancient Romans didn't use to eat food that came to Europe from America or Asia afterwards (after their time/later).
For example, they brought corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no Roman of those times had ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their divinities, considered the home of that divinity.
The people made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to listen to the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house is very important.
The greater part of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were open-air counters that jutted out into the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There weren't big forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was colonized with less density. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Even if every nation was from Scandinavia, there were still many differences between the people, the kings, the traditions, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that behind the Declaration of Independence there was painted a treasure map.
Anyway, it wasn't true. Even if something is drawn behind the document, it's not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence of June 4, 1776". The text appears at the end of the document, upside down.
Nobody knows for certain who wrote it, but it is known that when this large parchment document (which measures 116 centimeters by 96) appeared, it was rolled up to be saved.
Mate, it's also possible that the annotation was only attached as a tag.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French "Vichy" regime. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Only two weeks had passed when American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were advancing into Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture that belongs to a large number of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, associated with the Latin "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and which defines, in some way, the greatness of society.
City-states were born before nations. A civil culture signifies the passage of knowledge through various generations, a long cultural imprint, and a certain broadening.
Cultures that are too small often disappear and do not leave behind certain historical documents, and cannot be known as true civilizations.
When the Revolutionary War happened, the thirteen states first created a weak central government, made up only of the Congress, under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who often did not help, to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to remove the laws on taxes and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before being changed, and the states had such a low opinion of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is considered the second strongest team in the world and was champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The most well-known sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the biggest is Honshu), so Japan is the seventh largest island country in the world!
Thanks to its island groups/clusters, Japan has always been called, from a geographical point of view, "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of the island, initiating a transformation in the aboriginal production practices of wheat and employing Chinese laborers to work in the sugar and rice fields.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) occupied the coastal areas to the west and north and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the dominion of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made of three structures, which are called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the sides of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally were.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was rebuilt and the restoration continues even today.
As an example, the most common still image photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant size when the era of analog film ended.
It was still made today, but above all its aspect ratio was taken from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The format called 35mm is a bit misleading because in reality it's 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore defined as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal or quite close to this relationship.
A rule that is heavily exploited and often ridiculed by others is only a guideline to create dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
It is said that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see the example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was placed under control.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion held the European nations together, despite their differences in languages and traditions.
He had a power that penetrated everywhere and struck everyone, from the king down to the common people.
One of the most important principles of the Church is to use wealth to alleviate pain and poverty, and the Church's money is saved for this specific reason.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money pushed many people to doubt whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective, it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated an internationally accepted and codified law by a series of international treaties of two past Sicilies.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing damage to neutral ships.
Since there was a limited response to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the predominant attitude of many citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horror and cruelty during the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the director of his old job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Afterwards, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods there were savage wars between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the most important chair in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Then, after the revolution, the jobs were opened to all male candidates and allowed success to the most ambitious and fortunate.
It's the same for the military because now military ranks were based on merit and not on class.
The French Revolution also inspired other oppressed people and working classes of other nations to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things other than his own worldly life. He often went to a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which still exists, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
In the peak of a mountain North of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the world.
Cheer up, it's not easy to find it even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, the isolation is total.
You can't see anything except a beautiful and clear sky above and the mountains all around. Inside the cave, you feel protected and hear little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), some small tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The sign for "up bow" looks like a V, and the sign for "down bow" looks like a staple or a square without its base.
"Supra" means that you start at the tip and push downwards, and "sutta" means that you start at the base (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward bow produces a more delicate sound, while a downward bow is stronger and more decisive.
You can write with a pencil your markings, but remember that the bow markings printed are there for a musical reason, so they must be respected.
The frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Therese was 11 years old and Louis Charles was 4 years old) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, on October 6, 1789 had to return to Paris from Versailles because of a crowd of women from the market.
In a carriage, they traveled towards Paris pursued by a crowd that shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a Versailles royal guard in the face of the terrified queen.
The costs of the United States' imperialism war in the conquest of the Philippine Islands were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to support most of the expenses and the interest on the bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Certainly, the super profits that came from the continuous exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The years in which these events took place are commonly called the "High Middle Ages," the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The term technological determinism can mean many things in practice, from technological push to technological imperative, which means that the destiny of human beings is inevitably linked to scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
There are two general ideas that many interpretations of technological determinism share: that the development of technology itself does not depend on cultural or political influences; and that technology has inherent "effects" on societies, rather than effects that are socially conditioned.
Imagine someone could say that the invention of motor vehicles forced the development of roads.
Nevertheless, a national road network isn't something that can be economically feasible for just a few cars, and for this reason, new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of owning a car.
Nowadays, it seems everyone has a car. This causes more accidents on the roads, and therefore new techniques are invented in medicine to assist the injured people.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, conceived by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and in time, customs and cultures linked to that geography arose, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws arbitrarily imposed.
Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, and so Constantinople was the fashion capital in the time of feudal Europe.
It is known as the epicenter of luxury, starting in the year 400 BC and continuing until the year 1100 AD.
Its importance declined in the twelfth century mainly because the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this period that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Originally, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Anyway, because of the slow communication channels, the trends arrived 25 or 30 years late.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses seeds saved within the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase production.
Historically, many farmers were occupied with subsistence agriculture, and this still happens in many developing nations.
Subcultures gather like-minded people who feel alienated from societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the era, ethnicity, class, position, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that make a subculture so distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and dialect.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take as a basis a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to abandonment, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
These children are called "feral" or like little animals. Some feral children were abandoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children was caused by the parents' rejection of a child with serious brain or body problems.
Wild children can quickly experience serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that some were raised by animals; it is said that others spent their lives alone in nature.
If raised only by animals, the feral child has behaviors (within physical limits) like those of the animals that raised him, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, but scaffolding moves a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method for learning, but a support that is given to those who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real: a teacher can be a form of scaffolding, but the same applies to the little paperclip man from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internal to the software and have the function of requesting, prompting, and explaining the procedures that may be too difficult for a student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse or mistreatment.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not cared for, loving, and educational, but they do.
We think that the foster care system is a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable guidance, and secure healthcare.
The foster care is intended to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken and removed.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The internet has particular characteristics that lead to connecting other dimensions to manage uses and satisfactions.
As examples, "teaching" and "socialization" can be important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) found two ideal new aspects: "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships," when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to many important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, the facial movements that last only milliseconds.
Above all, it is said that you can discover if a person is cheating by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless correctly assess sincerity.
It is also suggested that these abilities in interpreting human behavior are also possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century proved that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs by taking them from available plant resources.
Then, the impossibility of doing so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and stems, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, the animals that are eaten (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a lot of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problems" the way chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is a process of deliberately waking up during a normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a slightly silent alarm clock to give you awareness without waking you up completely.
If you notice someone changing the alarm while you're sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a diuretic) before sleeping, so that one has to wake up to urinate.
The more inner peace a person has, the less tension there is in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded through the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In the beginning, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is made of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Divinity. Through visualizations of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War and led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the contrasts in system, process, and culture led to the division of the States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years and was fought for real, by the representative armies, in the battlefields of Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize near the Roman bridgehead.
Anyway, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Russian Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the ocean.
The work of the navy is to ensure that the nation maintains the ability to move people and goods, and at the same time, to prevent the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this thing was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using only U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in a herd that roamed the hills or other pastures, and the herds were often tended by young shepherds who were often children or young boys, they were like the more famous shepherds. These ways of keeping pastures are still used today.
The carriages were built in 16th century England.
Even though the carts were made of parallel wooden planks, the horses could pull them, and so they carried bigger loads and went faster compared to those slightly more dirt roads of that time.
Wooden sleepers were used early on to keep the wheels on track. Little by little, they realized that the wheels would have been more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
It became a common thing, but the iron caused much more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first railway made entirely of iron appeared.
The first means of transportation was walking, humans began to walk two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus perhaps walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more amicably with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can also be activists to reduce future suffering in some way.
This is only a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to deactivate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed due to the technological and scientific advancement of man, and the problems have become bigger because of overpopulation and the strange lifestyle of people.
Following its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap copies."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap copies known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk with two big claws in the back like the T-rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately obvious. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are too generic, so a quick diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine cabinet or household products containing toxins.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
Entomologists formally use the term "bug" for these groups of insects.
This word is used because they are related to the bedbugs that are found in beds, which have adapted very well to infest people.
Assassin bugs and also those that are found in beds are nidicolous, which is to say that they nest either in nests or where their hosts are.
In the United States of America, there are almost 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among adults and young people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A hen can choose to hatch a chick that she doesn't care about or that doesn't serve the interests of the chick.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for the infant.
In adoption, biological parents lose parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides a large part of scientific research.
It's not the only thing: experimentation too, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations, all lead scientific research.
The naturalist and philosopher adhered to the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's thoughts on all scientific matters were accepted, including psychology.
When knowledge of the Greek language was lost, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed that physiological rhythms and behavior often depend in an important way on the presence of internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to periodic external signals, have been documented for almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was a major indication that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into the bacterium.
They performed two experiments, labeling either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacterium with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the type of genetic material affected, or whether the cell affected is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are passionate about visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, plants, and wild animals.
Some examples of local activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be to visit, photograph, and learn things about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the country towns by car to go to work and meet other people who work in the place they left from.
This means that everyone is tied to a transportation system that relies on private cars, and so they make it grow.
Science now says that this great carbon economy changed the biosphere from one of the stable states that aided the evolution of humans in the past two million years.
Everyone is part of a society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaint are heard regarding water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why are there so many complaints about the transportation systems, why do they fail every day? Are all the transport engineers incompetent? Or is there something more important underneath?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic is difficult because drivers' behaviors cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, it seems that drivers behave reasonably; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a certain coherence and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationship must be established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This type of relationship helps to plan, design, and operate road services.
Insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings behind their body.
This gives them more places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can no longer fold their wings are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Someone thought he was right, but many people thought the opposite: that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, even the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems logical because the Earth doesn't appear to move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places up to six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that comes from the rivers of the planet and reaches the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gets its water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the construction of stone pyramids continuing until the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for laws and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by almost all those who work for the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and bronze since ancient times, given that all of these can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
These were more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, so he also theorized that they change with new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. It shouldn't be forgotten that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
They can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Listen, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as newer writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and use.
People now write messages on the computer screen, without needing to get close to a pencil sharpener anymore.
One can only wonder what a keyboard will be when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Sharing the core afterwards allows for a little release of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to split apart with little or no encouragement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the high plains.
There might be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on discovering what makes people angry or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and desires that are internalized as they grow and become adults.
These theories look at what motivates certain people to do the things they do, and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start leading those who were previously their peers, two behaviors can emerge. Part of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (like buddies).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and maintaining people's accountability.
On the other end of the spectrum, someone becomes an unrecognizable person who feels they have to change everything the team does and make it their own.
Ultimately, the boss is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often becomes a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams must maintain the same levels of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams because their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also the unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member refers to. The invisible team decides the requirements for each member.
Why would an organization want to go towards a process that wastes a lot of time to establish a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all applicable resources are used successfully within the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be seen.
As a result, the process of working together in an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead the new innovative process to serve the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, those in charge must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) dismisses the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a high level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide the physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it narrows down and gives more precision to the area of research.
The correlation between mental illness and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors influence behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study the structures of the brain and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the internal processes of our mind.
Even though AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the behaviours, learning, and intelligent adaptation within a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and organization, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and requests, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
These things became separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to everyday life problems.
The NA system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and is also built into various home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are important for this type of class. Teachers often like to take students on trips that can't be done by bus.
Technology offers the solution for virtual trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, go to the aquarium, or look at fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
To be clear, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website dedicated to the trip they take to the capital. Every year the site is changed, but the old versions are saved online to serve as sketches.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and writing, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer is beginning to desire to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging then "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to nurture the public's interest inspires students to be smarter and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to increase learning, even going beyond traditional school days.
Appropriate use of a blog can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding actively to internet material, students can define their position in the context of other writers as well as define their own perspectives on a particular problem (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the beautiful bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and in the North are found the natural beauties of Muskoka and others besides.
All these things and others underline that Ontario is considered the substance of Canada by foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost wild, uninhabited heaths.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the biggest, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wild animals.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and famous as luxury holiday resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which took strong root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from the Cape of Europe to India.
In the north, the region is connected to the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is advised that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It would also be nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should consider that cultural differences might make certain things seem like harassment, but there it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You have to be strict in refusing men, and don't be afraid to be on your own (cultural differences or not, it's not good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, before abandoning it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is among the least interesting places to buy things, where everyone is from Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easier to find places that sell typical Moroccan products, like tagines, vases, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole bunch of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far East, near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which covered most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Even though Goma is quite safe, visits outside the city should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that still continues in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano or for starting one of Africa's less expensive treks to see the mountain gorilla.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the shortest ride.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" became a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even having a reputation as a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
She was one of the major voices during the PBS special by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arab style than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, and each one has its own wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions of South Africa and is considered the jewel of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all National Parks in South Africa, there are conservation fees and daily entrance fees for the park.
It could also help someone buy a Wild Card, which grants access to a selection of South African parks or all the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists think of as the main spot.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering strip that is prominent with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the other side on the Kowloon shore.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers took as their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world, spanning 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of India and Bangladesh.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove fringes - they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered by water/wetland areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a nature sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 chital deer in this area.
Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) during the day, and more frequently, especially those going to the east, and to Jakar/Bumthang another one leaves at 06:30 and 07:30.
Given that intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
The majority of the districts are served by small Japanese tourist buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel in nearby areas, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a cable-stayed bridge. It is located over the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. It was erected in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checks should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other tribes of natives, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, initially called "The great province of the Indies," arose as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization which lasted for three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here you can also follow the tournaments and the less important matches at other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and to find out where to buy tickets for polo matches, contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), with a value equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West Store.
English sentence: English pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
On the more remote islands, it is likely that credit cards are not accepted, even if British and American currencies may be accepted; inquire with the owners beforehand to find an acceptable payment system.
It's practically impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; in the summer months it is common to have temperatures above 30°.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There aren't seasons where it "rains too much" or that are "too dry": the water that rains is the same throughout the year.
Even though most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities advise staying at least 100 meters away from bears and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
Even if they may seem docile, bison, aurochs, reindeer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of tourists get injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so you have to give them their space.
Remember that the smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of a little less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa starting in 1959.
The port was the site of a naval incident in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of one English ship. Almost 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is located between two harbors. The ones with the most people are found in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where you can swim safely, with pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Even though the beaches are full of families, there are plenty of shops to buy what you need near the sea. You can swim safely.
The most important local beer is called “Number One”. It’s not a complex beer, but it’s good and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to try, but it's easier to find wines from New Zealand and Australia.
The water from the fountain is drinkable without problems, but bottled water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. The normal short one is the "espresso," the cappuccino is served with a lot of cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Trips to the coral reef are organized throughout the year and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Anyway, follow the advice of the authorities, respect the signs, and pay attention to the safety warnings.
Sea wasps are found near beaches and in the estuaries of rivers from October to April north of 1770. During these periods they can sometimes be found out of the water.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and swim away.
Sea cucumbers do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If they book in advance, tourists can rest assured that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often offer deals with specific hotels, even though it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, always through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
You can also keep the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other necessary documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
All changes or requests had to be made to the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
For certain festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp there, and many participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to arrive early to find a place to camp out near the music.
Remember that even if the music in the main parks has finished, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, because passing through the ice produces a rather horrible noise for the more sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg allow for spending a little time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
It is known that casinos test everything to increase the time and money spent by guests. Generally, there are no clocks hanging and no windows, and finding the exits can be difficult.
To keep guests happy and prevent them from leaving the establishment, casinos usually have good special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, when someone is drunk they don't reason well, and all the good players know the importance of staying sober.
Whoever has to drive at high latitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very cold temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on normal asphalt.
During snowstorms, a lot of snow can fall in a short time, enough to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling snow, freezing fog, or ice on the car windows.
However, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's greatest tourist attraction and the most important moment for many visitors.
The word "safari" in popular usage refers to overland trips to see the extraordinary animals of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to approach cars, and with the appropriate equipment, they can be observed well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen with a telescope.
A walking safari (also called "forest walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") is a walk lasting a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics are held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some matches are held in other cities throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics (the first were hosted in 1964).
If you booked the flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you could find yourself in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies can be different, but starting from the end of March, most Coronavirus cancellation policies did not cover the end of July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is said that most tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130000, and the cost of standard tickets is around ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes can be helpful to dry them. In many hotels it is possible to borrow an ironing board and an iron even if they are not present in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you aren't interested in putting on ironed socks, then you can use the hairdryer, if there is one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric too much, because it could shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
There are many different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific contaminants.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute might be enough, while in others it takes longer.
The effectiveness of filters can vary, and if you have doubts, consider buying bottled water sealed by a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animal parasites that they are not familiar with in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can wound or kill people with force are usually not classified as parasites.
Buying at duty-free shops is a way to buy goods without taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers heading to countries with a heavy taxation system can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway because it crosses very isolated wooded terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: there are many overhanging slopes and narrow roads and curves.
Speed limits are lower than the preceding and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and respecting them is very important.
Oddly, the mobile phone service works better here than in other areas, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Sweet things with fruit are common, especially those with apples that are found all year round and those with cherries and plums that are found in the summer.
Many German sweets are also made with almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most famous cakes often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to try something sweet, small, but very tasty, try what, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and in certain other regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term to refer to a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used without other adjectives, this term tends to indicate the food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features dishes with simple seasonings. The predominant flavors preferred by the inhabitants of Java are peanuts, chilies, sugar (mainly Javanese cane sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the feet of the riders that hang from the sides of the saddle.
They offer more stability to the rider, but can have safety problems because the rider's feet can get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from the horse, but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse continues to run. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
To begin with, the knights wear riding boots with a heel and a fairly narrow and smooth sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that make the leather stirrup come off if it's pulled backwards by the falling rider.
Cochamó Valley: the main climbing destination of Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a great variety of granite walls and cliffs.
From here, one can see very beautiful panoramas. Climbers from all parts of the world constantly discover new routes in its infinite potential of walls.
Winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan their vacations solely to ski in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers are from 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 some Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski touring.
It is similar (but usually doesn't involve) alpine ski touring in alpine style or climbing, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much tougher skis and boots.
Think of the ski course as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, one can cover longer distances compared to walking, but only very rarely can one reach the same speeds as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. In normal circumstances, to travel from one country to another, you would have to apply for visas each time and go through passport control.
In this sense, the Schengen area functions as if it were a single country.
Provided that you stay within this zone, you can usually cross the borders without going back through passport control.
In the same way, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa to enter each member country of the Schengen area separately, and thus save time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition that says handmade objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define objects older than 100 years as antique.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicraft items can be defined as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of sustenance for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for others who do other jobs.
However, even historically, not all Sámi have always raised reindeer, but to survive they engaged in activities such as fishing, hunting, and the like, and used reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi have modern jobs. Tourism is a very important resource in Sápmi, the area of the Sámi.
Even if it's widely used, especially among those who are not Roma, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and the wrong perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you want to visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel or trip cancellation insurance might change.
You can also see the notices from governments different from the one you like, even if these notices are intended for the citizens of the corresponding country.
To be clear, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations compared to European or Arab citizens.
Advertisements are just a summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often summary, general, and very simplified when compared to the more detailed information that can be found in other sources.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general term to indicate dangerous meteorological phenomena that can cause damage, serious social problems, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur in all parts of the world, and there are different types, which depend on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of bad weather, such as downpours, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
The regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, storms, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be informed about the risks of bad weather in the area they intend to visit because travel plans could change.
Anyone planning a trip to a country that can be considered a war zone must receive professional training.
Searching on the internet for "Course for hostile environments", perhaps you can find the address of a local company.
The course covers all the issues described here in a much more detailed way, usually with practical experience.
Usually a course lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid concepts, and sometimes even weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about how to survive in the wilderness are common, while there are few publications that talk about war zones.
Travelers who plan to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to prepare passports where sex is not indicated (X) or documents updated according to a desired name or sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is also highly variable.
Security checks and searches became even more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
People who are changing sex have to expect to undergo security checks before the operation; their privacy and dignity will not remain intact.
Rip currents are the return flow of waves that break on the beach, usually at a coral reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in certain deeper sections where a fast current can form towards the deeper water.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion, because people try to swim back to shore against the current, which is impossible.
Once you manage to get out of the current, swimming towards the shore is no more difficult than normal.
Try to head towards a place where there's no more current or, depending on your abilities or if someone saw you, you can wait for help.
Reverse culture shock arrives even before culture shock (because there aren't many sweet moments), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes miss and struggle to readjust to their culture of origin.
When someone returns home after many years in another country, having adapted to the new culture, they realize they have lost some of the customs of their original culture.
In the early periods abroad, it's possible that people had patience and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country had to get used to it.
People don't even imagine that travelers returning home might need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
Usually you hear the voices of the tourists and the vendors. The story of the sounds and lights is like that of a storybook.
The Sfinci is the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the highest number of bases, 16 of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
The other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano creates a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula join here with the plateau and then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth mountain range, 360 km long and divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, with Mount Vinson reaching 4892 m.
In isolated places, where there is no telephone coverage, a satellite phone is the only option.
The satellite phone isn't an alternative to the cell phone, because to make a call you have to be in the open and clearly see the satellite.
The service is often used on ships, including boats for personal use, and also on expeditions that go far away, where internet data and connections help them make long-distance calls.
Contact your local telephone service provider for more information on how to connect to this service.
A increasingly popular option for people planning a gap year is that of traveling and learning new things.
This option is especially popular with graduates, who take a year abroad before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a one-year course abroad can offer more opportunities to begin university education when returning to one's own country.
Usually there is an enrollment fee to pay to register for these training programs.
Finland is a beautiful place to explore by boat. The "land of a thousand lakes" is full of thousands of islands, in the lake areas and the archipelagos of the coastal areas.
To wander through archipelagos and lakes on a yacht is an extravagance.
Although the archipelagos off the coast and the larger lakes can accommodate all types of yachts, smaller boats and even kayaks can offer a different experience.
Boating is one of Finland's national pastimes, so much so that there is a boat for every seven to eight people.
These numbers also exist in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but we're talking about a unique situation (consider that Holland has one for every forty people).
Most Baltic cruise itineraries include a long stop in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
It means that it's possible to visit the historical city for a couple of days while sleeping on the ship.
If you join land excursions organized on board, you don't need a separate visa (in 2009).
In cruise advertisements, Berlin in Germany is mentioned. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea and a visit to the city is paid for separately from the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a very terrible experience for people of all types and ages, especially if they have never traveled before or have been victims of a traumatic experience.
There's no need to be ashamed: there's no difference with other fears and dislikes for other things that are very common to many people.
For some people, knowing a little bit about how an airplane works and what happens while it's flying can be helpful in overcoming the fear of things they don't understand or can't control.
Delivery companies are paid well to make fast deliveries. Often, time is important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, the larger companies own the planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there were problems.
Things were shipped by air, and on certain routes it took days to unload and carry out customs checks.
The only way to ship the goods faster was to send them as luggage on the plane. Airline regulations do not allow sending luggage without passengers, and that's where you come in.
It takes money to pay for the privilege of flying in first class or business class (it would be better to get it out of the principal).
Don't think it's something you can buy for next to nothing: generally, you pay up to four times the price of a normal ticket for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it's not worth looking for discounts for seats in first class or business class for direct flights that go from point A to point B.
Airlines know that there is a certain group of passengers willing to pay a higher price to travel faster and more comfortably, and therefore they make them pay more for the ticket.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic where there have been ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but which is not recognized by any of the countries of the United Nations.
Economic connections were re-established between these two parts of Moldavia even if the political negotiations were unsuccessful.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million people, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an important transportation hub.
Formerly called Smyrna, it is now a modern and vibrant commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The grand avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers mingle with palaces with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, mosques and ancient churches, even if the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has a peculiar octagonal church.
In the courtyard of the church, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on top of coffins.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk around the village.
To the north and not too far away is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, famous to foreigners thanks to the beautiful stories of its splendor written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb Bus number 403 goes all the way to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Always north, visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, where there were several apparitions of the Madonna.
Remember that you are visiting a place of mass graves, as well as a place that has a significance that cannot be calculated for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived the time they spent here, and many others who have loved ones who were killed or who worked here until they died, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not deface the place with writings or drawings on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the great majority understands it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are written only in Catalan because it is legally the first official language.
And also, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and in public offices.
The normal announcements on the subway are in Catalan, but the unscheduled interruptions are announced with an automatic system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even if this is a wrong stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as one can, like someone "bien élevé" (well-raised, with a good education). This way, living in this city becomes much easier.
The cold appearance of Parisians quickly changes if you show some basic courtesy.
The Plitvice National Park is full of forests, mostly beech and fir trees, and the vegetation is a mix between alpine and Mediterranean.
The great variety of plant communities is noted, due to the many microclimates, diverse terrains, and varying levels of altitude.
In this area there are also many species of animals and birds.
And there you can find rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat, and many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries give scarves to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring one yourself, especially a colorful one, the nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Even men need to wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can also find these on loan at the entrance, but seeing as they're not washed after every use, you might find it uncomfortable to put them on. One size fits all!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and other toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, together with the word "Sie," which means "Your Grace," always begin with a capital letter, even if they are found in the middle of a sentence.
This is a very important way to recognize certain verbs and objects.
Probably, it also simplifies reading, even if the writing is complicated because you have to understand if a verb or an adjective is used as a noun.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because almost all the words are read as they are written.
One must pay attention to the letters "c" and "g", because the pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
One must also be careful to pronounce single and double consonants differently, as they can change the meaning of the word (for example, "caro" [dear] and "carro" [cart/wagon]).
The grammar of Persian is quite easy and without many exceptions.
Dude, by reading this basic grammar manual, you can already learn a lot about Persian grammar to understand the sentences better.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish might quickly think that Portuguese is quite similar and that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and remain as museums or training facilities.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem back then as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on university campuses, and are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
The majority of modern research telescopes are enormous structures located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Observing the blossoming of cherry trees, an activity known as "hanami," has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept derives from China, where plum blossoms are the favorite flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and certain members of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.
Plants thrive if they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick even "just one" specimen.
Anyone caught picking a plant while visiting the Italian garden will be immediately expelled.
Singapore is usually a very safe and easy place to get around, where you can buy everything as soon as you arrive.
But since it's located in the tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, it's hot (always) and the sun is strong (when the sky is clear, which is quite rare).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional place where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and doesn't stop in the Jewish city of Kiryat Arba.
Inland rivers can be an interesting theme for organizing a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or the Erie Canal.
They also define hiking trails and cycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions of this festivity were also adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries of the world.
There's a tradition of staying awake and outdoors on Easter night to watch the sunrise.
There are certainly theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The more traditional churches hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night of Easter weekend and organize celebrations at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the distance from the mainland, mammals did not manage to complete the journey, and the giant tortoise is the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of men in the Galapagos, many mammals were introduced, including goats, horses, cows, mice, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis because the sky is always dark all day long.
Since there is a small population and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal compared to the Western one.
The clothes are business casual style, and colleagues are addressed by their last name or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental. Group work is praised instead of praising the results of individual people.
Employees often have to receive approval from superiors for all the decisions they make and have to obey the instructions of superiors without question.
