This not only confirms that certain dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but provides specific details generally unavailable from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's fur is brownish-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The study also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possessed other feather characteristics - barbs and barbules - researchers concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development of these other features that came later.
The feather structure suggests it was not used for flight but more for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that even though the tail is from a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers belonged to an adult and not a juvenile.
The researchers suggest that, even though it was a young dinosaur's tail, the sample showed adult feathers and not downy chick feathers.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for is due to tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that dark matter throughout the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a voting booth, placing a pre-printed paper slip showing their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officer verifies the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
French electoral law strictly codifies the proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the start of voting and that no envelopes are inserted except those belonging to voters who are counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the afternoon, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed to allow emergency services to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering her child.
He is in custody pending charges and trial, but any witness evidence may be tainted because his picture has been publicly disseminated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the justice system in Scotland is different, and the courts consider publication of photos could cause prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee stated that "journalists are likened to walking a dangerous path if they publish photos and other belongings of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for all prosecutions, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
Based on the document leaks, the document refers to border disputes claimed by Palestine based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other topics covered reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, where is holy to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement was signed, while the PA agreed to a military presence for only five years.
Pest control shooters in supplementary trials must be closely supervised by rangers, while the trials are monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
He was Martelly's fifth Prime Minister in four years.
The Presidential Commission last month recommended the previous CEO's removal as part of measures to prepare the country for fresh elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime riots that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests occurred due to the failure to hold elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning and overheating iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they are aware of 27 accidents linked to the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had announced an addition of 34 cases of overheating, but the company deemed them "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report delay "deeply disappointing".
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office says no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami threat.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at the tourists.
A number of hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as was a Filipino photographer.
The photographer then took the old woman's place because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza had been shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research indicates that if hormones are administered, they will accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorder "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two months. Pretty unique like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented "Luna as weird as I am...maybe more...love her and will miss her...may her soul rest in peace."
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed think they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of public opinion polling, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints led many to doubt his fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to manage his pain because it had been banned from the Competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth at some point in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political discussions and nonsense."
He was speculated to be president in 2016.
NextGen is an FAA claims system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older land-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to track aircraft locations more accurately and provide more precise information to pilots.
No additional transportation will be provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, while parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available at the venue.
Fearing a lack of transportation raises the possibility that the game will be played without team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved after only two generations, even though this process was believed to take longer, due to interbreeding between a Darwin's finch endemic to the island, the Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, the Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed into various kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can then be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be produced very thinly, and adheres to other metals. It can be made so thin that it can be used to decorate books with hand-painted illustrations called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make a marker using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) a chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton with its electron removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean, damp hands, roll the mixture into balls.
The liquid on the hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel strange and form a shell-like layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Wastewater from sewage systems has been found in Minoan townhouses in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During the Roman civilization, toilets became part of public bathhouses where men and women mingled freely.
When you contact someone thousands of miles away, it means you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive signals and bounce them back down almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with lighting and our view.
It takes a giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, to put satellites or telescopes in space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The wheel's greatest contribution to us is the creation of easier and faster transportation.
He has brought us trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Below them were more medium-sized cats that ate medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and mouse-deer.
Finally, there are many small-sized cats (including stray cats) that prey on more small victims like insects, mice, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept, a specific task for each cat that prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups called "prides".
A pride of lions is formed of one to three adult males, along with as many as thirty females and their cubs.
Women are usually close to each other, as they consist of a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions acts much like a pack of wolves or dogs, a startling similarity in behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Ready to attack, tigers can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four types of cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the resonant bellow of a lion, but more like a jumble of words, a scream of words.
Ocelots enjoy eating small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if possible. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than their own size.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and hunt animals for food (prey) by using their sense of smell, which involves sniffing the ground they have passed.
Ocelots can see well using night vision, and also move slowly. Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding in environments that resemble their body color and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they travel across mountains or rivers, or if they migrate to a new island so they cannot easily move back), they often end up in a different environment than before.
This new environment contains diverse resources and different competition, therefore the new population will require different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The indigenous people haven't changed at all; they still require the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as new residents starting to adapt to the new environment, they began to look less and less like other residents.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they are no longer of the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which is inhaled by humans, and absorb carbon dioxide exhaled by humans (during breathing).
Plants produce food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator in its time, making it fear nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are equipped with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional set located on its palate, meaning there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We are not entirely sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, and even a giant dinosaur like T. rex wouldn't be able to compete with it.
While we would recognize most of their food, the Romans also had strange or bizarre feast foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women ate their meals while sitting on chairs, the rich liked to feast together where they would relax on their sides as they ate their food.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built primary temples for each of their gods, which were considered the gods' homes.
The people will bring offerings to the gods, and the priests will try to fulfill the needs of the gods through various ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctum that is only permitted to priests.
Sometimes, distinctive pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of these temples.
The top of the tower became a sanctuary for the deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house is no longer so important.
Much of Hebrew family life took place in the open air.
The woman is cooking in the yard; the shop is just an open counter facing the street. Stone was used to build the house.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was a very expensive resource.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and while sailing west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, disregarding his discovery, the Eskimo tribe had already settled there at that time.
Even though each country is a 'Scandinavia', there are many differences in people, royalty, culture, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie 'National Treasure', you might think of a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence is "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down beneath the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early life, this large patchwork of documents (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is possible that the added notation is just a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated northern France, but the southern part remained unliberated.
It was ruled by "Vichy" France. They were French citizens who made a peace pact with Germany in 1940 and chose to collaborate with the occupiers rather than resist them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces attacked southern France, an assault called “Operation Dragoon”.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in an integrated manner, a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin "civilis," meaning public, which is related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and that also, in a way, defines the size of a society.
A city-state is the beginning of a nation. The culture of civilization signifies the dissemination of knowledge from generation to generation, a cultural footprint that always exists, and its equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with Congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes and, because there was no national executive judiciary, it depended on the power of the states, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He also did not have the right to reject interstate tax and tariff laws.
This article calls for unanimous consent from all regions before they can amend [something], and the regions are taking the federal government lightly because their representatives are frequently absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the North, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to being a cluster/group of islands belonging to Japan, Japan, from a geographical standpoint, is usually referred to as an archipelago.
As early as the 15th century, Taiwan began to be seen and recorded by European traders who called the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, creating a transformation in the grain production practices of the indigenous people and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a territory of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the dilapidated buildings have been restored to give tourists an idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu would have been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common image in photographic format in the world is 35mm, which corresponds to the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced until today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, being 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest overall ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, formats from the APS family) are the same as or close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of order within an image.
He stated that the most effective spot for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very rich and powerful, began to be doubted.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
His absolute power influenced everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and suffering, and church financial funds are specifically for that cause.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the strength of its power and wealth has led many to question whether this faith has been fulfilled.
Not long after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies to the military and civilians, even though this blockade did not comply with generally accepted international laws established by several international treaties two centuries ago.
Britain mines international waters to prevent any ships from entering any part of the ocean, causing danger even to ordinary vessels.
Since there had been a limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the common attitude for most people and countries was one of pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, a number of countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his former workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time, with each era of China or each ruling family at the time having its own dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there were also periods of unstable and fragmented territories. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During that period, a fierce war erupted between several nobles vying for the throne.
Three Kingdoms was a bloody era in Ancient Chinese history, where thousands died fighting to sit on the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
Various social and political impacts will emerge, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolute monarchy to a republican system, as well as the awareness and spirit of nationalism that the country belongs to the people and not a single leader.
Moreover, after the Revolution, positions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same goes for the military, because instead of military rank being based on class, it is now based on calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad SAW was very interested in matters beyond the ordinary life. He often visited a cave, later known as "Hira," on Mount Noor (light) to contemplate.
He dug it out himself, persevered throughout, giving a very clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is actually not easy to find, even if one knows of its existence. After stepping into this cave, it is completely silent.
Nothing can be seen except the bright, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. Only whispers of the world can be heard or seen from within this cave.
The great pyramids of Giza are one of the seven wonders of the world that still stand today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramid structures built to commemorate deceased Pharaohs.
On the Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead Egyptians, there are several pyramids (including the largest pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" symbol is similar to the letter V, and the "down-bow" symbol is similar to a staple or a square without the bottom side.
"Up" means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and "down" means you should start at the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a soft sound, while a down-bow produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Feel free to write your own markings, but please remember that the printed bowing marks are there for musical purposes. Therefore, they should always be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
Riding in a horse-drawn carriage, they returned to Paris and were surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats at the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
Once upon a time, a rioter held up the head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The U.S. imperialist war expenses to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and floating bond interest in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the immense profits associated with the continued exploitation of the Filipino people will be the bedrock profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one needs to understand the context that triggered the creation of the order.
The period in which the event occurred is usually known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing various ideas, ranging from technological progress or technological imperative to the strong feeling that human destiny is driven by a logic associated with scientific laws manifested through technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on existing society, rather than the social situation.
For example, one might say that motor vehicles lead to road development.
However, the road network across the country is not viable for just a few cars, so new methods of production were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Very high car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, which leads to the creation of new techniques in healthcare to rehabilitate injured body parts.
Romanticism possesses a significant element of cultural determinism, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and with the passage of time, customs and cultures associated with this geography emerge. And this, being more in harmony with the position of society, is better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the center of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was considered the center of feudal European fashion.
It was known as a center of luxury starting around 400 AD and lasting until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, primarily due to the Crusaders who returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were worth more than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the shift of the Fashion Model title from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the biggest developments at that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out to produce food for the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating from a specific ecological area and is combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were involved in agriculture for subsistence, and this is still the reality in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel ignored by societal standards and allow them to develop their identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define distinct cultural branches may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, sexual politics, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a cultural group typically display their membership symbolically through specific styles, whether in the form of fashion, behavior, or language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to consider several unfortunate cases of children experiencing neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, and who were not socialized with adults as they grew up.
Children like that are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this child neglect is caused by parents rejecting the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Other children have been claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child will exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like the animal that raised them, such as a fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make the learning process easier and more engaging, scaffolding provides more than that.
Scaffolding is not a method for learning but more accurately an aid, that is, providing support to individuals undergoing new learning experiences such as using new computer programs or starting new projects.
Scaffolding can be either virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, and so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and acts to question, assist, and explain procedures that the student might find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed with foster families for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even for the purpose of extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment devoid of caregivers, concern, and education, but they do.
We see the Foster Care System as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Childcare should provide all the necessities that cannot be provided at the home from which the child is taken.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to an added dimension in terms of usage approach and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al, 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that occur in milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that one can detect whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting subtle changes in facial expression.
In his paper "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrates how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He suggested that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two types of genetic variation groups: hidden and apparent.
New genetic variations, increased mutation, and selection emerge from the pool of changes that are highlighted.
Segregation and recombination reshuffle the variation between two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so will have serious consequences: increased depression, unbalanced nutrition, and ending in death.
The most readily available plant-based protein sources are those found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested, but it provides a high quantity of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors overcame their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimps on the savanna do today.
Sleep procrastination is the act of intentionally delaying going to sleep, reducing the total time available for sleep.
This can be easily done by using a silent alarm clock to wake up without fully waking you.
If you find yourself hitting the snooze button in your sleep, the alarm clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, unacknowledged diuretics) before bed, forcing someone to wake up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace is inversely correlated to their level of bodily and mental stress.
The lower the pressure, the more positive life energy appears. Everyone has the potential to find true peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only things standing in the way of this goal are stress and our own negative nature.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been extended with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism has very simple principles. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a comprehensive path of love.
Kundalini energy (energy of awareness) is awakened with Kundalini Yoga through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Visualizing various deities purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras, and establishes inner awareness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the US. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to conflict between these nations.
Two years after the war ended, the former allied parties became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will be fought overtly by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
Approaching September 17th, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight after 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is the most effective method for moving large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the navy is to ensure your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, while disrupting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most well-known recent examples of this is the WWII North Atlantic campaign. The Americans were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, was trying to halt shipping traffic.
If the Allied forces had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to raise them for easier access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats are generally kept in herds that roam hills or other pastures, often tended by goat herders who are usually children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherds. This herding method is still used today.
Carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagonway consisted only of parallel wooden planks, it allowed horses to pull it at higher speeds and haul heavier loads compared to the rougher roads of that time.
Cross-ties were introduced quite early to hold the track in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the track would be more efficient if it had iron strips on the top.
This has become a habit, but the iron has worn down the wooden wheels of the carriage.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were launched.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their supervisors, the Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in an environmentally friendly way, we can join environmental movements, and even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we must find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite clear that the world is changing significantly due to human scientific and technological advancements, and problems are becoming greater due to overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles.
After being adopted by the congress on July 4th, the written draft signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located several blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as “Dunlap broadsides”.
The first reading of this document to the public was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which was read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 known surviving copies of Dunlap broadside printings are the oldest existing versions of the document. The original handwritten copy is lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider it to be a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
It has scaly legs and claws, lays eggs, and walks on its two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only contain one of two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning cannot be quickly proven. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best clue to internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicine containers or poisonous household cleaning products.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to that poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term comes from an ancient association with bedbugs, insects that have adapted well to become human parasites.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are altricial, adapting to live in nests or dwellings.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A married couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make adoption plans for their baby.
In the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take over as parents to the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method essentially guides most scientific research.
He is not alone; experimentation and experiments are tests used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's commentaries were accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from learning the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are typically heavily reliant on the existence of endogenous cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to periodic external cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustained oscillator that will continue its free-running cycle even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two tests that labelled either the DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks as well as learning information about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to work and are passed by other people whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone, in some way, is connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that the massive carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states, which had supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the association and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why does the transportation system elicit such complaints, why does it fail to function daily? Is it due to incompetent transportation engineers? Or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, traffic flow analysis is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent manner; thus, traffic flow is also reasonably consistent and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
This relationship assists in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helps them evade predators easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back against the sides of their body.
This gives them a large area with small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars as well).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It holds more than 8 times the water compared to the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, measuring six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued to use stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of their construction.
The new kingdom of ancient Egypt admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is the everyday language used by most of those who work in the country, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that everything is made of a mixture of four or more elements. They are earth, water, wind, and fire.
This is more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it is also theorized that they transform into new material to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that several trillion of them can fit within the dot at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil has been a good friend to many people since its creation.
Unfortunately, when newer methods of writing emerged, the pencil was relegated to a status and usage that was very low.
People these days write messages on computer screens, without having to be near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to keyboards when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to bind nuclei with a large number of protons and neutrons.
Like pulling a heavy cart uphill. Separating the nucleus once again and then releasing a little of that energy.
Certain atoms have an unstable nucleus, meaning they can disintegrate with little or no stimulus.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria in the nearby areas because the crust is thinner there. This makes it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding what makes people tick or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans have specific needs and/or desires that have become ingrained when they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what is inside a person that makes them want the things they want, and the things in their environment that will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can arise when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain part of the old gang of friends.
Managers like this struggle to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, conduct performance appraisals, delegate responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the other hand, someone will turn into an unrecognisable individual who feels that they need to change everything the team has done and add their personal touch.
Besides, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes disputes between the leader and other group members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for nearby physical groups.
They usually have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of "invisible teams" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"The invisible team" is a management team to which all members report. This "invisible team" sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to engage in the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of practicing the learning organization concept is innovation.
When all resources are used effectively across every functional area of an organization, creativity and innovation can occur.
As a result, collaborative organizational processes to overcome obstacles can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must foster a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it refines the field of research, making it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior assists scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in various mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build a simulation model, which helps us to understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer answers and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Things like this have become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into some home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher wants to take their students somewhere that is not accessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing virtual tours is a great way to illustrate the visit and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capital, and each year the website is modified, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with grammatical and spelling errors, the presence of an audience can generally transform them.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger began striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Writing blogs also "forces students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to attract readers inspires students to write cleverly and engagingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can provide opportunities for students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to internet material, students can determine their position in the context of other people's writing and also outline their own perspective on related issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, with diverse art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north are the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and many more highlight Ontario as a true Canadian experience for visitors from abroad.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some are nearly uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are either independent nations, or associated with France, and known for luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and it has spread rapidly in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
This region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Woman: Female travellers are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
There are advantages to wearing a ring (but not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting people, and don't be afraid to stand strong (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city such as Daru I-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a rice-based trade there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in Morocco.
It's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, pottery, leather goods, shisha, and various small ornaments around the old Medina, but that's just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's roads, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside of Goma should be assessed to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu province.
This city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the most affordable gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Combined with its inaccessible location, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
This is one of the main stops during the PBS special Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World".
This city differs from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic style than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the pride of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are conservation and daily entry fees for the park.
It can also benefit one to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either select parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is a place considered a major focal point by many tourists.
The Hong Kong skyline, with its rows of buildings, is likened to a glittering bar chart, made even more prominent by the reflections in Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The majority of urban development in Hong Kong's islands is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that was taken by the British colonizers as their own, and if you are looking for historical proof of the colonization of this region, this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest littoral mangrove swamp forest in the world, spanning 80 km (50 miles) from the coast deep into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangroves - they include some of the last remnants of depleted jungle covering the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is covered by water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is now estimated that around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer live in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station in the district (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Due to intercity buses always being full, it is advisable to purchase tickets several days in advance.
Most regions have the comfortable and reliable Japan Coast Liner bus service.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the Oyapock River with the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, once the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani people are a prominent group of indigenous people inhabiting the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has successfully preserved the character and identity of its indigenous people.
Argentina is very famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest championship of the year will take place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller championships and matches can also be seen here in other years.
For news about the tournament or where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
Pound Sterling is generally accepted everywhere in the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currency may be taken; check with owners in advance to determine what methods of payment are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it experiences summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures exceeding +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptive: the temperature rarely rises above freezing, but the wind and humidity make it feel much colder than the thermometer reading.
There are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, maintain a distance of 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
However tame they may appear, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain a safe distance. These animals are very large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be careful because strong smells can attract bears and other wild animals. Therefore, avoid bringing or cooking strong-smelling food and always maintain campsite cleanliness.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a famous naval military conflict in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All of the ships had sunk, except for one British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town led to the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland spans two harbours. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming and plenty of shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, on the edge of the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is a family-friendly beach that is sometimes crowded, with various types of shops lining the coast. It is safe for swimming.
The main local beer is ‘Number One’. It’s not a complex beer, but it's tasty and refreshing. Another local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. Strong black coffee is "espresso," cappuccinos have a high pile of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on par with Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but really delicious.
This reef is visited repeatedly throughout the year, and injuries caused by any of these sources are rare in the reef area.
However, seek advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and carefully observe safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They are occasionally found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the open ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives peace of mind to travelers that they have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or packages that combine hotels and flights.
They can also make a booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendments or requests must be submitted through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of those attending the music festival decide to camp on-site, and most groups consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get in early to secure a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
There's a festival with a special camping area for families with children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabins, as sailing through ice produces loud noises for those involved.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually always absent and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment offers, to ensure guests are in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks at home. However, intoxication can impair judgment, and all sensible gamblers know how important it is not to be affected by alcohol.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or crossing mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
Icy and snowy road conditions cause low friction, and you cannot drive as if you were driving on regular paved roads.
During a snowstorm, you can become stranded, buried by snow in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
Conversely, being covered in snow and cold is normal in most countries, and traffic is mostly smooth throughout the year.
Safaris are the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" is popularly used to refer to overland journeys to view the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and standard equipment that allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes feel scared, and you will see these animals better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") involves an adventure, lasting either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having previously hosted them in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation in 2020 before the postponements were announced, you might face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but by the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with the average ticket costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards for loan, even if they are not provided in the room.
If there is no iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Please be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, fire).
There are various ways to filter water, with certain methods being more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in other areas several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter pests that they are not used to seeing in their home country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals can forcibly injure or kill people; never validate them as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from tax and excise duties in specified locations.
Tourists heading to states with heavy taxation can sometimes save money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through remote wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful as steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limit is clearly lower than before in the subsequent sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than before.
Surprisingly, the mobile phone service is stronger here than in other parts along the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The pastries found in Germany are quite delicious, and the pastries in Bavaria are rather sweet, creamy, and diverse, similar to the pastries found in the southern neighboring country, Austria.
Fruit pies are a common dish, with apples being made into pies year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often delicious eaten with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small yet rich and fatty pastry, you can try pastries named after their region of origin, such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices cooked with meat or vegetables.
Curries can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without qualification, the term refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine presents a diverse range of subtly seasoned dishes, typically featuring the Javanese's favorite flavors of peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of fragrant spices.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider, but there is a safety risk due to the potential for the rider's feet to get caught.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they will be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear boots with heels and soles that are flat and relatively narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have a safety bar that allows the leather stirrup straps to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by the rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its numerous big walls and granite cliffs.
Its spire includes stunning views from the summit. Climbers from around the world are continuing to forge new routes among all its endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding over a snow-covered surface with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a central activity for many travel enthusiasts, some of whom are known as "ski bums" who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing has existed for a long time — cave paintings depict skiers from as early as 5000 BC!
Sliding down hills as a sport began at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational tobogganing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related but usually does not involve alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering; mountaineering is done in steeper areas and requires stiffer skis and boots.
Think of ski trails as being similar to hiking trails.
In good condition you will cover more distance than walking - yet very rarely will you get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on a groomed track.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through various countries would mean going through visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
However, the Schengen Zone functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you are within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Likewise, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member country separately, thus saving you time, money, and documents.
There is no universal definition to determine which manufactured goods are antiques. Certain tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
That definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handcrafted products may be defined as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding its trade is also important for other professions.
Although traditionally not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, instead living by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, they usually kept reindeer as transport animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Gypsy" is considered derogatory due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate assumptions about Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation may be affected.
You may also want to consult advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than European citizens or Arabs.
Official announcements are merely brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are usually cursory, general and oversimplified compared to information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and forest fires are forms and impacts of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena, including blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Tourists are advised to be aware of any severe weather risks affecting their area, as these could impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should obtain professional training.
Searching the internet for "Hostile environment course" will likely provide you with the addresses of local companies.
A course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last for 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, extensive first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about surviving in the wilderness are common, but publications about war zones are few.
Voyagers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they carry valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to verify these documents varies widely.
Security checks at checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people cannot expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
A rip current is a backflow from waves breaking on the shore, usually at reefs or the like.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow is concentrated in certain deeper areas, and strong currents into the deep water may form there.
Most deaths occur due to extreme exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you are out of the current, the ability to swim back should not be more difficult than usual.
Try heading to a place where you haven't been caught yet, or, depending on your experience and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock happens earlier than culture shock (there's a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be worse.
Tourists who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have a difficult time readjusting to their own original culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your home culture.
When you first travel abroad, people may be patient and understanding, considering that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
The public cannot expect patience and understanding to be mandatory for returning travelers.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most exciting events in the area for children.
You can see the pyramid in the dark and in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can hear the sounds of tourists and traders. This sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and a plot element in a long story.
The scene will be projected onto the pyramid, and different pyramids will be illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the highest number of bases, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago stretches 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
This also includes Livingston Island and Deception Island, which is an active volcanic caldera flooded and provides a stunning harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Mountains in the Peninsula are connected to highlands, then further connected to form a 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, peaking at 4892m Mount Vinson.
In a remote location with no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Generally, satellite phones are not a replacement for mobile phones, as you need to be outdoors to establish a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make phone calls.
This service is frequently used by shipping, including cruise ships, as well as expeditions with long-range data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider will be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular choice for those planning a gap year is to travel and study.
This is very popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education in your home country.
Typically, tuition fees will be charged to register for these educational programs.
Finland is the best destination for those who love boating activities. Also known as the "Land of a thousand lakes," it also has thousands of islands located along its lakes and coasts.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in archipelagic and lake areas.
While the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are big enough for any type of sailboat, small boats or kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with roughly one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, while it is rather unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the value is one to forty).
Most Baltic Cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a few full days on your way home and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore using your cruise ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures highlight Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for anyone of any age and background, especially if they have never flown or have had a traumatic experience.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from fears or dislikes of other things that many people commonly experience.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and how they are controlled in the air may help overcome their fear, which is based on the unknown or a feeling of not being in control.
Delivery companies are paid handsomely to deliver goods quickly. Often, time is of the essence with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On certain routes, larger companies own their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, they face difficulties.
If they ship goods by air, on some routes it may take several days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to do it faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, which is where you're needed.
The clearest way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a significant amount of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for your ticket).
However, this isn't cheap; as a rough guide, you can expect to pay four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a specific customer segment willing to pay a significant amount for the privilege of reaching their destination quickly and comfortably, and price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been rebuilt between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of nearly 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, thriving, and busy commercial center located near a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide roads, glass buildings, and modern shopping malls are juxtaposed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, even though the city has an atmosphere more like the Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the church, there are interesting marble carvings of doves on top of some tombs.
It's worth taking half an hour to stroll around the charming village.
Heading north and easily accessible is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, made famous to foreigners after its glory was recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus makes frequent trips to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the northern part, visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Shrine), a world-renowned Marian apparition site.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a large burial ground, which is also an area of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived that place, and many more who have loved ones who were murdered or forced into labour until death there, regardless of whether they were Jewish or non-Jewish.
Please treat this site with dignity, seriousness, and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
It is forbidden to damage the site by marking or making graffiti on any structure.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the population prefers to speak Catalan because a large number understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, all signs only use the Catalan language because legislation stipulates its status as the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Periodic announcements on the Metro are announced only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions will be announced by an automated system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Paris residents are known for their reputation of being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
While this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave well, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-raised). That will make it easier for you to get around the city.
The aloofness of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in dense forests, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a diverse range of plants, due to the range of microclimates, differences in soil types, and varying altitudes.
This area is also a habitat for various species of animals and birds.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and also clothing that covers their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own shawl, especially a brightly colored one, you will be greeted with a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Following that matter, men are required to wear long pants that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not be comfortable wearing this skirt. One size fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like other cuisines in the Mediterranean, consists of bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available side dishes such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, besides the word "Sie" for "you", are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between different verbs and objects.
It can be argued that it simplifies the reading process, even though writing is complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is being used as a noun.
Pronunciation in Italian is easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, make sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means chariot.
Persian has a relatively easy and regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar material will help you delve deeper into Persian grammar and better understand its phrases.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, many people with a smattering of Spanish are quick to conclude that Portuguese is almost the same and therefore does not need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are not in use today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Light pollution in their heyday was not the type of problem we have today, usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to achieve than what is built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originates from China, where the plum blossom is the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festival was organized by the emperor only for himself and other nobles around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the urge to remove even "just one" specimen.
If visiting a formally managed park, collecting "specimens" will also get you ejected without discussion.
Singapore is generally very safe and easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But placed in a "high tropical" area just a few degrees north of the equator, you will experience hot weather (always) and blazing sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are several buses heading north towards Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Double-check that bus you're thinking of goes to Hebron and not just the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways might be a good theme to start a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to the attractive cities on the Danube, or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also marked out trails for hiking and cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important celebrations in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of these holiday traditions are also practiced by non-religious people in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of staying up on Easter night in an open space that allows you to see the sunrise.
There is certainly a Christian theological explanation for this tradition, but it is possible that it is a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility custom.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil on Saturday night of Easter weekend, with worshippers cheering at exactly midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived in these islands migrated here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, thus making giant tortoises the primary grazers in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, a large number of mammals have been introduced to the islands, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis because the sky will be dark almost all the time.
Because this area is sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal compared to what Westerners are typically used to.
A suit is standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by family name or job title.
Workplace harmony is paramount, emphasizing teamwork over individual achievement.
Workers usually need to obtain approval from their superiors for any decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
