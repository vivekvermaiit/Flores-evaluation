Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but it also provides details that fossils typically cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage (feathers) was chestnut brown with yellowish tinges on top or carotenoid-colored underneath.
This research also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, known as the rachis, but do possess other feather characteristics - barbs and barbules - researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers propose that although it's a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows mature feathers and doesn't exhibit the downy plumage of a chick.
Researchers suggest that although it is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult features and not the fine feathers of a chick.

They found the Sun, like other stars, to adhere to the same fundamental principles: the activity of all stars in the system was influenced not by anything else, but by their light and rotation.
A star's Rossby number is determined by using its brightness and rotation together, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less dynamically active the stars are with respect to antimagnetism.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but this program was written for a standard model of observations made from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
The effects the team was looking for are likely being caused by tidal interactions between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational pull on the Earth causing tides, similarly the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy exists in a halo around the galaxy, and it is composed of many small particles.

In France, the voting process has traditionally been a low-tech affair: voters isolate themselves in a voting booth, mark their preferred candidate on a pre-printed paper sheet, and then place it in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identification, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
French electoral law strictly legislates these actions.
Since 1988, it has been essential for ballot boxes to be transparent, so that voters and observers can see that no envelope was present at the start of voting, and no envelope was added, except for the envelopes of authorized voters that were properly counted.
Candidates have the right to send their representatives to monitor every aspect of this process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and according to specific regulations.

In her second run, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth overall in the women's competition with a combined race time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Australian, Claudia, who came in first place, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian, Gyongy Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's starting group failed to complete their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to achieve a ranking in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya has said that "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered the victim's mobile phone and laptop from them."
The accused have been identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused were presented in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained a severe head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekuoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since being accused of murdering his son.
She will remain in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony will be tainted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University stated, "Journalists who publish photos of suspects, etc., are walking a dangerous line."
The Crown Office, which oversees all operations, has indicated to journalists that there will be no further comment, at least until charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document will reference the border dispute, which Palestine requires to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East War border.
According to reports, other covered topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is respectful to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands its military presence in the valley should remain for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to such a presence for five years.
The experimental pest control trial is closely monitored by shooters and rangers as the trial is monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program in partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mac O'Flynn, the Supervising Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters initially selected for culling received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) the previous day.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed CEP's early departure as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the anti-government protests that began in October was lukewarm.
Failure to hold elections ignited sporadic violent protests; some elections had been pending since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, MEITI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 instances of overheating, which the company deemed "not serious."
In its response, the ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office has said that there has been no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that no tsunami observations were made.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza sprayed tourists with bullets from his M16 rifle.
Multiple hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
The six kidnap victims, including children and the elderly, who were with the Filipino photographers, were released soon after.
The photographers then sat in the old woman's place after she went to relieve herself. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She received training in Kabbalah and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at a hospital, Lejen began investigating premature births in his spare time.
Her research showed that administering a certain hormone could accelerate the rate of fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Loona.
Tommy Dreamer has said that, Luna Vachon, the first queen of extreme, was my first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night.
Dustin Golddust Runnels commented, "Luna was passionate like me... maybe even more so than me. I was very attached to her and will miss her dearly... I hope she's in a better place."
Among the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of opponents to making Australia a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic upon the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the poll believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In an opinion poll conducted at two extreme ends of the spectrum, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the Commonwealth Games in three relays and the 100m and 200m freestyle, but their health became questionable due to their complaints.
He cannot take the medications he should be taking for pain relief because those medications are prohibited during those sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Multiple people confirmed the discovery with the help of hardware and software in early February, and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
In the United States, there are also several federal service academies where non-commissioned officers of the US military are trained, and they graduate with bachelor's degrees.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship this year and last month signed a bill legalizing gay marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and foolishness."
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to FAA claims, allows aircraft to fly on shorter routes, saving them millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology, which, in contrast to somewhat older ground-radar-based technology, allows air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more skillfully and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no further transport available, and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there is no car parking or park and ride available on the ground.
Fears over the lack of transportation have increased the possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought the process would take longer; this evolution occurred through breeding between the native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all sorts of shapes. It can be formed into even the smallest shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be bent and kneaded. It can be rolled into sheets and hammered.
It can be made extremely thin and adhered to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in books to decorate hand-painted images in what are known as "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called pH in chemistry. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color change of cabbage juice depends on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level in the tested chemical is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Combine both dry powders and knead them together, then squeeze the mixture with clean, damp hands to form a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react against the external surface, causing a tingling sensation and forming a shell-like substance.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, which was connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sewage drainage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A signal is received by a satellite in space, and then it immediately sends it down to Earth.
The satellite was sent into space via a rocket. Earth's atmospheric environment distorts our eyesight and vision, so scientists use telescopes in space.
Launching a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket with a height of 100 feet.
The invention of the wheel brought about amazing changes in the world. For us, the wheel's greatest contribution is providing fast and easy mobility.
He provided us with trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Under them are medium-sized cats whose diet consists of medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to barasingha and deer.
Finally, many small cat species, including domestic cats, prey on a large number of insects and rodents.
Their secret to success was the concept of suitable placement and specialized tasks assigned to each individual, which kept them in competition with one another.
Of the cat family, lions are the most socially behaved species, living in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions typically consists of one to three related adult males along with around thirty females and cubs.
As a large family of women, sisters, and daughters, they generally share very close relationships with one another.
Lion prides operate much like packs of wolves or dogs, surprisingly exhibiting canine-like behavior (but not like other big cats), and are highly lethal to their prey.
A well-formed athlete can climb like a cheetah (not perfectly), swim, jump a good distance, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The cheetah belongs to the lion, leopard, and jaguar group (genus Panthera). These four are the only cats that can roar.
A cheetah's roar isn't like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a grumpy shriek.
The serval cat likes to eat small animals. It will hunt monkeys, snakes, mice, and if it can, birds. The animals that the serval cat hunts are quite a bit smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that plains cheetahs track and locate prey by scent, sniffing their way through their territory.
They can see well in the dark and move stealthily using their night vision. Serval cats blend in with their surroundings to attack and capture their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from a larger population (such as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island and then cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different kinds of resources and different competitors. Therefore, the population will need different kinds of features or applications to vigorously compete, compared to what they needed in the past.
There has been absolutely no change in the original population; they still require the same level of accommodation as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they gradually start to look less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants release oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans.
Plants make their food in sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and prepare our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals cannot survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared no one except perhaps other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional row of teeth on the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing in its path could escape it.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a pointed snout. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
Everything that entered the water came under its attack, not even a large dinosaur like the T-Rex could match it.
Although Roman food is familiar to us, their feasts also included some bizarre items, such as wild boar, peacock, meats on skewers, and mongoose.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the wealthy preferred to organize banquets together where they could lie on their sides while eating.
The cuisine on the tables of ancient Greece could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, nor had any ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The inhabitants of Babylon had built a primary shrine for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People used to bring sacrifices to God, and priests tried to present God's needs on occasions of ceremonies and festivals ((God forbid)).
Every temple has an open courtyard and within it, there is a sanctum that only the priest can enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top part of the minaret was a special and sacred place for God.
Houses were not as important in the hot climate of the Middle East.
Most Christian families lived in the open air.
In the back, women cooked food. The store had an open counter that faced the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland had a very small population. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and traveling further west, found a green land and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although every country is 'Scandinavian' in its own right, there are numerous differences between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland in terms of people, authorities, customs, and histories.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not correct. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence were "Original Declaration of Independence Dated 4th July 1776". The text appears on the bottom and top part of the document.
While it wasn't clearly known who authored it, it was known that early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage above.
So, it's likely that the symbol was simply included as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was governed on behalf of the "Vichy" French (the puppet government of France). These were the French who made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France, an attack that was codenamed "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is that single culture that a specific group of individuals collectively adopts, who live and work in a cooperative manner; a society.
The word "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means "in a private capacity as an individual," which is related to the Latin word "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," which refers to a city or city-state, and somehow also describes the size of a society.
City-states are the news carriers of a country. A cultural civilization means transmitting knowledge and arts across multiple generations, establishing a lasting cultural imprint, and properly propagating it.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind adequate historical evidence and fail to be recognized as complete civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress as their sole component.
Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who often did not cooperate in enforcing its laws.
He also had no authority to overturn tax laws or interstate tariffs.
Unanimous consent of the states was required to amend these clauses, but the states were conspicuously absent from the central government.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful in the world, and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern regions, and Italian people participate in international sports and Olympic competitions.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest island being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to having a collection/group of islands, Japan is geographically termed an "archipelago."
Taiwan traces its beginnings to the 15th century when passing European sailors documented the island as Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift in indigenous grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) occupied the western and eastern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing dynasty.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three man-made structures, including the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the edges of this complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can accurately see what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the most popular film size until the analog film era ended.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio comes from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format actually measures 36mm wide by 24mm high, in a somewhat counterintuitive way.
Therefore, it is said that the aspect ratio of this shape (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to, or very close to, this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often the target of criticism, serves as a singular guideline for introducing dynamism into a photograph while maintaining order and composition.
It states that the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of lines that divide the reflection into three equal parts vertically and horizontally.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity, despite different languages and traditions, had united the European states.
All these dominant powers influenced everyone, from the king to the common people.
A core tenet of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church financial funds exist primarily for this reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted principles of international law that had been established through international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines indiscriminately in international waters to prevent any ship from entering all parts of the sea, thereby endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the response to this tactic was very limited, Germany expected the unrestricted submarine warfare to have the same reaction.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrific and brutal events of World War I, nations desired to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to New York City in the United States and began working with the Edison Company.
Upon arriving in America, he had 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) for Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique method of signifying different periods; each era or dynasty that remained in power in China was a distinct royal house.
Additionally, there was an unstable period of divided provinces amongst each family. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Jer Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, there were fierce battles for the throne and crown among many nobles and dignitaries.
The history of ancient China includes the Three Kingdoms period, one of its bloodiest eras, in which thousands died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
Here, there are many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to democracy, nationalism, and the shift in thinking that the country belongs to the common people, not a single ruler.
Following the revolution, all crafts were opened to male applicants, providing highly motivated and accomplished individuals with the opportunity to succeed.
The same applies to the army because army rankings are now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed workers in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave on Mount "Noor" (Light), known as "Hira," for contemplation and reflection.
He confined himself to the cave, which, having passed through periods, vividly portrays Muhammad's ﷺ spiritual experiences.
This cave, located on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find, even if someone knows of its existence; once you enter the cave, there is complete isolation.
Beyond the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding hills, nothing else was visible. Very little could be seen or heard from the cave about this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many extensive pyramid structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," located in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The up bow symbol looks like the letter V, and the down bow mark looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
You mean that you should start at the tip and press the bow down, and going downwards means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
The upper bow usually produces a soft sound, while the lower bow is more powerful and firm.
Use your pencil freely within your marks, but remember that the hidden spring marks are musical cues; therefore, they should be respected.
A frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister Madame Elisabeth were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
When they returned to Paris in a carriage, they were surrounded by a mob chanting slogans against the King and Queen and threatening them.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
On one occasion, a member of the mob brandished the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, before the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They paid taxes to the government of the United States in order to pay interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks under the name of "Major Portion" and the Philippine government.
In fact, the supreme interests gained through the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that motivated the creation of this order.
The era in which these events occurred is generally referred to as the Middle Ages in European history, spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages and then the Late Middle Ages, which collectively ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the advancement of technology or the inevitability of modern technology, to the strong feeling that human destiny is governed by an underlying logic tied to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development follows a path of its own, independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has effects on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily paves the way for road development.
However, laying a road network across the country for only a few vehicles is not economically viable, therefore, new production methods have been devised to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a high rate of accidents on roads, prompting the invention of new techniques in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a significant element of cultural commitment, drawn from writers like Goethe, Gottlieb Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, the traditions and culture associated with that geography, and which were in harmony with the place of society, were superior to codified laws.
Just as Paris is known as a fashion hub in the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion center of feudal Europe.
It is believed to have started around 400 AD as a center of luxury and extravagance, and it lasted until the 1100s AD.
The primary reason for its decline in the 12th century was that the Crusaders returned with gifts like silk and spices, which were priced higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
This was the time when the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style flourished between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Clothing was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to a slow communication system, the Western style might lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time was popularizing the use of buttons for fastening the clothing of crusaders.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming that is carried out solely to provide food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is simple, often organic, maximizing system output by using locally conserved ecosystem seeds in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for their livelihoods, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal norms and empower them to develop a sense of identity.
Subculture can be specific due to the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic styles, including fashion, specific styles, and the use of slang.
One of the most common methods used to highlight social importance is to identify a few unpleasant incidents during children's upbringing where they were not allowed to participate in social activities, being neglected by adults, or being subjected to misfortune or deliberate abuse.
Children of this kind are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are imprisoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the reason for abandoning the child is that the parents reject the child's serious mental or physical defect.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Other individuals have allegedly been raised by animals; some are reported to have been living independently in the wild.
Feral children, when raised entirely by non-human creatures, exhibit behaviors (within psychological limits) almost entirely like those of the nurturing animals, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, guided didactic techniques facilitate a step further.
It's not just about learning to fold; rather, it provides assistance to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Its fold can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is one form of its fold, but so is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software. Their purpose is to question, prompt, and clarify procedures that may challenge the student to solve independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever be raised in an environment that is not conducive to nurturing, care, and education, yet people do it.
We consider the foster care system a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and a reliable healthcare system.
The goal of foster care is to fulfill all the needs that were not being met in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the internet are that it leads towards an additional degree of direction in terms of ease of use and satisfactory procedural application.
For example, "learning" and "social interaction" are considered important motivations for Internet use (James, 1995).
When Egami and McCord (1998) researched audience reactions to a website, they also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as newly motivating aspects.
The use of video recording has led to significant revelations in the interpretation of micro-expressions and fleeting facial movements lasting only fractions of a second.
Specifically, it is claimed that a person can detect whether they are lying by accurately displaying microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out how individuals who are unable to understand communication due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that some of the abilities to interpret human behavior may be found in animals such as pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has revealed that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and apparent.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
In every generation, variations have occurred, stemming from the separation and mixing of two groups.
In the vast field outside, it is difficult for langurs, who have a digestive system similar to humans, to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so can have dangerous consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available resources in plants, leaves and grains, contain proteins, but these are difficult for creatures like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy for them to digest, but also contain a high amount of protein and all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that langurs do today on the open plains.
Waking up during your normal sleep hours and then falling back asleep (within 10-60 minutes) is a purposeful process.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself snoozing your alarm clock in your sleep, it could be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a significant amount of fluids (especially water or tea, which increase urination) before sleeping, forcing someone to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is related to the amount of tension present in their body and soul.
The less stress/anxiety there is, the more positive life force will be present. Every individual has the power to find complete peace and tranquility.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only obstacle in the path to this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, but it has been expanded through the Mahayana school's path of compassion and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of complete acceptance of loving-kindness.
Kundalini Yoga awakens Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathwork, mantra, and visualization.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Visualizing different deities clears energy channels, activates chakras, and generates enlightened consciousness.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which paved the way for cooperation between Russia and the United States. In the end, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures resulted in the devastation of countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This proxy war lasted for 40 years, with proxy forces fighting in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and numerous other locations.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat to the Romanian border for reorganization.
However, these plans were abandoned overnight when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships for the transportation of goods is still the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the seas.
The traditional role of the Navy is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to transport its people and equipment, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their people and equipment.
One of its most notable recent examples was the Battle of the North Atlantic in World War II. The Americans were trying to send people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Despite this, the German Navy was mostly trying to stop this traffic by using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have occupied Britain as it had occupied the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
They started keeping them for easy access to ancient culture and traditions, as well as the tribal milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Pet goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the mountains and pastures. These were usually supervised by Bakarwals, who were often young children and adolescents, similar to well-known shepherds. These herding practices are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in Britain in the early 16th century.
Although the wagons were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they helped horses pull them faster and haul slightly heavier loads on the poor roads of that era.
Cross ties were used in the early days to keep the tracks firmly in place. But gradually it was discovered that tracks would be more efficient if iron straps were placed on top of them.
This became a common practice, but due to iron, wooden carriage wheels began to be more embellished.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
The earliest form of locomotion was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus (southern ape), were not habitually bipedal.
Specializations for walking on two legs are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, while Sahelanthropus may have already been walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live a more environmentally friendly life, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become active members to mitigate future suffering to some extent.
This is often just symptomatic treatment in many situations. However, if we don't want just temporary solutions, we need to find and eliminate the root cause of the problems.
It is quite evident that the world has changed significantly due to humanity's scientific and technological achievements, and problems have greatly increased due to population growth and humanity's luxurious lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadside."
The first reading of the Declaration took place on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall by John Nixon.
A letter was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy of it reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlop broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original manuscript has disappeared.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and exists in a living state today; we call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they had feathers and were capable of flying.
But there are many things about these birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Most computers used virtually in the modern era are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, which are used to make up the language of computers.
Internal poisoning might not manifest immediately. Symptoms like nausea are so common that a quick diagnosis isn't always possible.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open bottle of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "bug" is used in a formal sense by entomologists to refer to a specific group of insects.
The term is derived from the paleontology of the bed bug, which are insects that adapt to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are both classic nidicoles, residing in the nest or home of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been found throughout the United States of America, making it a leading neurological disease affecting young adults and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or not in the best interest of their child.
These couples will have to choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of scientists is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and this essentially guides most scientific research.
This alone is not enough; experimentation is the test or means by which one or more hypotheses are rejected, questions are formulated, and the recording of observations also provides guidance in scientific research.
Physicists and philosophers focus on ancient texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's theories on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the Greek language declined, the West's connection to Greece's philosophical and scientific roots was severed.
Many people observe that synchrony in physiology and behavior often depends on the presence of their production via lunar cycles and biological clocks.
Such recurring rhythms that are not merely a reaction to some external periodic cue have been noted for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to maintain the period of a free-running cycle even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was the most important regarding establishing DNA as the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments: one to create phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and another to create phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on its type, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline, a mutation can have diverse effects.
Only mutations occurring in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts individuals interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery, including the flora and fauna wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, hiking in parks, and studying information about ecosystems.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave from the small towns of the country by car for their workplaces, leaving behind those whose workplaces are where they just departed from.
Everyone on this kinetic transport shuttle is interconnected, and is helping to support a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science today indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone in society uses the transportation system. But it's strange that almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you occasionally hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate complaints like this, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is the matter of a different nature?
Traffic flow is the study of the interactions of individual drivers, the movement of vehicles between two points, and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is very difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonable consistent limits; thus, there is some stability in traffic flows and it can be modeled mathematically to some extent.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key variables: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and activation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first living things to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them eliminate enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects benefit from being able to reattach their wings to their bodies.
This provides them with a wide range of small spaces to hide from wild animals.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought they were right, but many others believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and other stars as well).
It seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth; in some places, it's six miles wide.
20% of all the water that flows from the Earth's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The actual Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids built at Giza are unmatched in terms of their size and quality of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were in awe of the monuments of their ancestors, which were already thousands of years old at that time.
Vatican City has a population of approximately 800. It is the world's smallest independent country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a commonly spoken language used by many people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Humans have been familiar with basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these elements could be discovered in their native form in the natural world and mined with relatively primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was largely like the four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances that we observe.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also take alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atomic particles are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the distance to the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pencil came into existence, it became the best friend of many people.
It's a pity that a new way of writing has been invented, diminishing the status and use of the pencil.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens; they never even need to go near a sharpener.
One can only imagine what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
An implosion-type (fission) bomb works on the principle that a nucleus remains intact with its protons and neutrons due to nuclear energy.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Then, some energy is released due to the nucleus rearranging itself.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can break apart even with a slight disturbance or no disturbance at all.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer surface of the moon is called the crust.
This crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on one side and 100 kilometers thick on the other.
It's thin under Maria and thick under the hills.
There may be volcano-like formations and rocks on the nearby coast because the coast is very thin and it was easy for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what people need and desire.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that are inherent as they approach adulthood.
These theories discuss the factors that motivate certain individuals to do the things they do, and what aspects of their environment encourage or discourage them from doing certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge in managers when leading their former peers. One aspect of the picture is that they try to "remain one of the boys (or girls)."
A manager like this struggles to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct performance reviews, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
On the other side of the picture, a person transforms themselves into an unrecognizable figure who feels the need to completely change and remake the work being done by the team.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success or failure.
Often, this behavior causes rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of innovation as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences between the two.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They have more autonomy than members of traditional teams because their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local administration may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
A matrix team is an administrative team to which each member must report. A matrix team sets standards for each member.
Why would any organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating organizational learning? One purpose of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively among all useful departments of an organization, creativity and skill are generated.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a cutting-edge innovative process to fulfill the user's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must foster a culture of innovation alongside shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuity perspective, which is a method used to help organizations achieve high standards of performance.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the study of consciousness, thereby narrowing the field of inquiry and making it much more pertinent.
The connection between brain pathology and individual behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of damage to the brain, trauma, injury, and tumors affect human behavior and cause changes in certain mental activities.
The development of new technology allows us to visualize and investigate brain structures and functions that could never be seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for establishing stimulation models, which helps us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI is strongly influenced by science fiction, it is a significant branch of computer science that deals with construction, behavior, learning, and acquisition of intelligence in machines.
AI research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligence-based behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, customer assessment and the ability to answer queries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Currently, AI systems are frequently used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in the creation of numerous home computers and video game software applications.
A field trip is an extensive part of any classroom. Most often, a teacher will want to take her students to places where there isn't a bus travel option.
Technology offers solutions through virtual field trips. Students can sit in their classrooms and view rare museum exhibits, tour aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art.
Participating in a virtual reality field trip is an excellent way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state's capital. The website is rebuilt every year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Students start their blogging with grammar and spelling mistakes, which are eventually corrected by the community of blog readers.
Since students are generally fond of criticism, the blogger tries to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to generate interest in readers (audience) motivates students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages sharing and fosters skills that help students learn better beyond traditional school days.
The appropriate use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical, enabling them to actively utilize online content to determine their own position in relation to the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's charming, bilingual capital, boasts numerous art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north are the Muskoka region and beyond, areas of boundless beauty.
All these things and much more define Antarao as among those things that are considered highly Canidian by outsiders.
Further north, a large area is sparsely populated, with some parts being almost uninhabited forests.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans residing in the United States than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African island is in the Indian Ocean and off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is extremely large, and when it comes to wildlife, it is a continent unto itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or affiliated with France, and they are known for their luxury beach resorts.
They brought Islam to the Arabian Peninsula and worked extensively in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, this area is bordered by the coast, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women traveling represent themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (not just one that looks very expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead them to perceive a normal thing as harassment; stalking, grabbing someone's arm, etc. are not out of the ordinary.
Be firm about saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Beida, and Spanish traders, who established their trading posts here, named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least favorite places to shop in Morocco.
Around the ancient city of Medina, you'll easily find places selling traditional Moroccan items like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of toys, but these are all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano, which filled most of the city's streets, particularly in the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any excursions outside of Goma should involve investigation to understand the state of ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
This city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, with some sightings of the flamboyant mountain gorilla in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. A normal (local) price for a short trip is 500 Congolese Francs.
The name "Timbuktu," with its connotation of inaccessibility, was used as a metaphor for a foreign, faraway place.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished area, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
This was one of the notable sites visited during Henry Louis Gates' PBS "Africa's Great Civilizations" special.
This city is completely different from the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab flavor and sensibility rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
This park spans an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which is conducive to distinct wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a key asset of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, this park also has daily conservation and entry fees.
It might also be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to a selection of South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the Hong Kong region and is considered by many tourists to be the center of their tourism.
The rows of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have taken the form of a shimmering bar chart, evident in the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront opposite it.
A large number of Hong Kong Island's urban developments are concentrated along the north shore, on reclaimed land.
This is the place that British imperialists had made their own, and as such, if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast into the remote, impoverished areas of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest located in the Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps—they include some of the last remaining strips of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that the area now contains 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses run throughout the day between the bus station (across the river) and other districts, although those specifically heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses traveling between districts are often full, it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese coaster buses are operated, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are faster and more comfortable for traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the cities of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana and Brazil across the Oyapock River.
The height of these two towers is up to 83 meters, and they are 378 meters long, with each of the two lanes being 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The full operation is scheduled to begin in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group, currently living in eastern Paraguay as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice agriculture as needed.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century AD, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," came into existence as a result of conflicts between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous communities.
The Spanish initiated the colonial era, which lasted for three centuries.
Following the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay managed to maintain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Canitas polo grounds.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be witnessed here during other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for information on tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at a 1:1 ratio.
Currency can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West Store.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands and Stanley Credit Cards and US Dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards from outer islands will likely not be accepted, although British, European, and US currency can be taken; inquire with the owners beforehand to determine the acceptable payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius are common.
Winter can be surprisingly cold: temperatures occasionally drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity make it feel much colder than the temperature shown on the thermometer.
There is no set time for the "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or teased.
According to park authorities, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wildlife!
Despite how polite they may seem, the arna, water buffalo, barasingha, moose, bear, and almost every large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be harmful, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smelly food attracts bears and other wild animals. Therefore, avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of approximately 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
Harbor (Pearl) Harbor was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
Apart from one British cruiser, all ships were sunk. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
The paramount chief of Piro Mauga, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed as a result of a peaceful gathering in the city during the independence struggle, which was organized by the Mau movement.
Auckland is situated on the edge of two harbors, therefore it has numerous beaches. The three most popular are in these areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour district) is situated on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by pōhutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Mission Bay is located on the waterfront Waitematā Harbour in the suburb of Balmoral and St Heliers is located in central Auckland.
Sometimes these family beaches are crowded, and there are many shops along the coast. It is safe to swim here.
The special local beer is called 'Number One'; it's not a heavy beer but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to drink, however New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is also easily available.
The concept of a "flat white" is unfamiliar to Australians. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino has a lot of cream (not froth) added, and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality; the fruit juice is expensive but good.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and damage to the reef from any of these causes is rare.
Nevertheless, consult with authorities, comply with all regulations, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near the coasts and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. They can occasionally be seen outside of these periods as well.
Sharks are present, however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their primary habitat is the river systems north of Rockhampton to the Jardine River.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that accommodation will be arranged upon reaching their destination.
Travel agents often have deals or offers for specific hotels, though it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodations, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or combined hotel and flight packages.
If you take too long to consider the offer or related documents for your destination (such as a visa), they may also cancel your reservation.
Any modifications or requests should be sent through the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the large numbers of attendees at music festivals decided to camp out there, and most attendees considered it a major part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, you'll have to go early to snag a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the main stage music program might be over, music will continue to play late into the night in many parts of the festival.
Some festivals have special accommodation areas for families and young children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as the sound of ice breaking can be extremely frightening.
A St. Petersburg cruise includes leisure time spent in the city. Cruise passengers enjoy a visa exemption (check conditions).
Casinos actively try to make time pass quickly and encourage guests to spend money. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and even exiting can be difficult.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and encourage them to stay at the location.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages at home; however, intoxication impairs decision-making, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high-altitude areas or passing through mountains should be aware of potential snowfall, ice, or freezing temperatures.
Icy and hail-covered roads have low friction, and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During a severe blizzard, enough snow to get you stuck can fall in a very short amount of time.
Visibility is also reduced due to falling or blowing snow, or due to condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy weather is common in many countries, and it often doesn't cause any disruption to travel throughout the year.
Safaris are arguably central to large-scale tourism in Africa and are a highlight for many visitors.
In common parlance, safari refers to a journey on land to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the wildlife of the green plains.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, approach the cars and will be well-observed by standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are generally shy and you are more likely to see them well through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having also hosted the games in 1964.
If you made your flight and accommodation bookings for 2020 before the announcement to postpone them, you may face difficult circumstances.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based policies from late March did not extend to July 2020, when the decision to cancel the Olympics was made.
Tickets for most programs are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with premium tickets potentially costing around ¥7,000.
Wet clothes can be dried with an iron. If you don't have an iron in your room, many hotels provide irons and ironing boards on loan.
If an iron isn't available and you don't wear un-ironed socks, try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat your fabric (otherwise it will either shrink or scorch).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other places, many minutes are required.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying bottled water in a sealed container from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal hazards unfamiliar to them in their native regions.
Insects can spoil food, cause inflammation, or, in dangerous cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered epidemics.
Duty-free shopping offers the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at designated locations.
By obligating travelers from other countries to pay heavy taxes, a reasonable amount of money can sometimes be saved, especially on goods like tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
Driving along the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which stretches between Point Marion and Fairmont, is challenging due to frequently passing through isolated inland wilderness areas.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, stay alert: these routes tend to have more bumps, narrow lanes, and sudden sharp turns.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than the preceding and subsequent sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to it is even more important.

Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
It provides the rider with more stability, but there is also a risk that the rider's foot could get caught in it.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. Several safety measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots that have a long heel, are smooth, are fairly narrow, and have a sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have a safety bar that, if pulled by a falling rider from behind, detaches the stirrup leather from the saddle, causing the rider to fall free.
Cochamo Valley, known as the Yosemite of South America, is the finest climbing destination in Chile, featuring a diverse array of large granite walls and cliffs.

Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are among the most popular sports where athletes slide down snow-covered slopes on skis or with a snowboard attached to their feet.
Skiing is a very interesting travel activity, which has many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan to spend their entire vacation at a particular place for the sake of skiing.
Skiing is very ancient—cave paintings depicting skiers are from 5000 BC!
The practice of downhill skiing began around the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia in 1861 by Norwegians.
Carrying gear on one's back and sliding on snow: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related to it, but generally alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering is not included; the latter is done in sloping terrain and requires more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route in the same way you would think of a hiking or walking route.
In good condition, you'll be able to cover more distance in some way other than walking. But only rarely will you be able to achieve the speed of cross-country skiing on groomed tracks without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has a large number of independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries would mean you have to apply for visas and passport control multiple times.
However, the Shenzhen area operates somewhat like a country in this regard.
As long as you live in this region, you can usually cross the border without going through the passport control checkpoint again.
Similarly, holding a Schengen visa eliminates the need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition by which manufactured goods are classified as antique. Some tax agencies classify items over 100 years old as antique.
The interpretation has geographical variations, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts can be appreciated as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many people associated with other professions.
Even the traditional Sami, although not all Sami were extensively involved in reindeer herding, but subsisted on fishing, hunting animals, and the like, kept reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
Although widely used, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive, particularly by non-Romani people, due to its negative stereotypes and association with misconceptions about Romani people.
If you visit a country for which travel advisories are in place, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may want to consider taking advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans and Arabs.
A government advisory is merely a brief account of the political situation in a country.
The ideas presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the detailed information found elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term that refers to any dangerous meteorological condition that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur in any country in the world, and it has different forms depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.

Rip currents are return flows of waves that end up on the beach, often rocky or similar.
Due to underwater topography, return velocities are concentrated on a few deep sections, and strong currents can occur in deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion caused by trying to swim against the current, which is likely impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming will not become easy as usual.
Aim where you won't be caught again, or, relying on your skill even if you've been noticed, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Re-entry shock tends to occur sooner than culture shock (it has a shorter honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Tourists who have found it relatively easy to adopt new cultures and civilizations sometimes find it difficult to re-embrace their own culture.
After living abroad, when you return to your homeland, you feel like you've become accustomed to a new culture and lost touch with the qualities of your native culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, the people there must have been tolerant because they knew that travelers arriving in a new country need adjustment.
It's possible that people may not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the most interesting things in this area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can also see them in the tranquility before the show begins.

Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by multiple nations and host many of their bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
This archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which contains the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other places include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a caldera filled with still-active volcanoes offers a stunning view of a natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau (i.e., a convex plain), then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360-kilometer-long range, which the Minnesota Glacier divides into two parts.
The Sentinel Range or northern part is the highest mountain range in Antarctica, with its peak, Mount Vinson, located on the Vinson Massif at 4,892 meters.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used in shipping, including recreational boating, as well as by adventurers who require long-range data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider can provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, a rapidly growing and increasingly popular option.
This is especially popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without disrupting their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year program abroad can actually increase opportunities for admission to higher education back in your home country.
Typically, these educational programs will have a tuition fee for enrollment.
Finland is an excellent place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in a series of lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on the peninsula lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are indeed too big for yachts, smaller boats, even kayaks, offer a different experience.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime, with roughly one boat for every seven or eight people.
In this regard, Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are comparable, but in other respects, it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the numerical ratio is one to forty).
The defining feature of most Baltic cruises is an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a full portion of the day for a few days and return to embark on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore using shipboard travel amusements, you do not need to obtain a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for individuals of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic incident.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's nothing more than a personal fear and other unwanted things that are found in many people.
Information about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies get paid well for delivering things quickly. Time is often of the essence for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts being sent for repair.
On some routes, large companies had their own plans, but it was a problem for other routes and smaller firms.
If they sent the goods by air freight, it may have taken days to unload and clear customs at some points along the way.
The only way to get it quickly was to send it as registered baggage; airline regulations wouldn't allow sending baggage without a passenger.
The straightforward way to fly in first or business class is to shell out a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or better yet, have your company pay for it).
However, it's not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay around four times more than standard economy class for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no reason to consider discounts for first class on direct flights for business or travel from one place to another.
Airlines know that a specific group of air travelers is willing to pay more dollars to get anywhere comfortably and quickly, so they charge them accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic democratic country that has been prone to ethnic conflict.

A tradition exists to spend Easter night awake, watching the sunrise in an open space.
There are certainly Christian religious interpretations regarding this tradition, but it may be a spring and fertility ritual from the pre-Christian era.
Often, traditional churches hold a vigil on Saturday night of the Easter holiday, and as midnight strikes, all worshippers celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
