This not only confirms the widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers were yellowish-brown on top and faded or carotenoid-colored underneath.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of bird feathers.
Dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis, which is the central shaft, but possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—leading researchers to conclude that the rachis evolved later.
Based on the structure of the feathers, their role in regulating temperature and display is far more significant than in flight. According to researchers, even if this belonged to the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen indicates that it is adult plumage, not downy feathers of a chick.
Although researchers believe this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern suggests that the feathers are those of an adult bird, not a chick.
Yesterday, a car bomb explosion at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, resulted in the death of two police officers and injured more than twenty people.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations to be made regarding the Merger galaxy.
The sought-after effect may be influenced by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy being studied and the dark matter of the Milky Way galaxy.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way is also exerting force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a halo around the galaxy and consists of many small particles.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In the interview, he said that the new strain of the virus "is a cause for concern due to its very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, with at least two being hospital medical staff.

The first cases of the disease this season were reported around the end of July.
This disease occurs in pigs, and then it is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes.
The disease prompted the Indian government to take measures such as deploying pig meat to severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying pesticides.
The government also promised several million doses of encephalitis vaccine, which will help prepare healthcare agencies for the coming year.
Due to lack of funding and lower prioritization in relation to other diseases, plans to deliver vaccines to historically most affected areas this year have been postponed.

In France, technology is generally used very little in voting: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper slip showing their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After verifying the voter's identity, officials allow the voter to deposit the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
France's electoral legislation strictly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes when voting begins and that no envelopes are added other than those from duly accounted for and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of this process. In the evening, under strict supervision, volunteers count the votes according to specific procedures.

In the women's event, four skiers did not finish their races, and in the Giant Slalom, 45 out of a total of 117 skiers did not place.
Madhya Pradesh police returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arya stated, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are: Baba Kandajr, Bhutha Kandjar, Rampro Kandjar, Gaza Kandjar, and Vishnu Kandjar.
According to Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants attended court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house, no one was injured when the car crashed into it.
However, the driver sustained severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, and emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT.
First, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred from the hospital where he was staying to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in custody at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of murdering his son.
He was taken into custody pending the indictment and the conclusion of the trial, however, any testimony from the witness could be tainted, as his picture was widely publicized.
This is a widespread practice in most parts of the UK, however, the Scottish justice system works differently and courts have considered that the publication of a photograph could prejudice proceedings.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said that journalists endanger themselves by publishing photos of suspects.
The royal office responsible for prosecutions told journalists that no further comments would be made until charges, at least, had been filed.
According to declassified data, the document concerns the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
According to the report, other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Following the signing of the agreement, Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while the PA agrees to limit such a presence to only five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control testing were to be under the strict supervision of the rangers, as the testing was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were engaged under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of the NPWS Parks Conservation and Heritage Division, the four marksmen selected for the initial shooting operation underwent comprehensive safety-related training and exercises.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the previous Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of preparations for new elections in the country.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes the reason for protests where force was used was the fact that elections had not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 iPod overheating incidents have been reported, six of which resulted in fire and four in minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it was aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, the METI organization announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating to it, which Apple called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the reporting deadline "genuinely regrettable."
The earthquake occurred in the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The emergency services in the Northern Mariana Islands report that no damage-causing incidents have occurred in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami indication.
Former Philippine police officers hijacked a bus in the Philippine capital of Manila, taking Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several prisoners were rescued, but it is confirmed that at least six prisoners died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, photographers replaced an elderly woman who had asked to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When Liggins started working at the hospital, he began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if hormones are controlled, the development of the baby's lungs in the womb may be accelerated.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered both "black boxes," the flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. Unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels explained, "Luna wasn't right in the head like me...maybe even more so...I loved and miss her...I hope she's in a safe place."
Support for Australia becoming a republic decreased by 8 percentage points (since 2008) among the 1,400 people surveyed in the lead up to the 2010 federal election.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of people surveyed share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
According to the survey, 29 percent of participants believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but health complaints raised doubts about their physical fitness.
He couldn't take the necessary painkillers because they are not allowed for participants in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people, using hardware and software, confirmed the scientific discovery by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic substances that could form proteins and allow life to exist.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, were formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, came into his position as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
In 2016, his participation in the presidential election was predicted.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, as well as save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
He uses satellite-based technology, not older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There are no extra vehicles being added and the Overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley, additionally car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable for use.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have indicated that the game may very well be held behind closed doors, without fans of the teams.
According to data from a study published in the journal Science on Thursday, a new species of bird has formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species emerged in just two generations, although it was previously thought that this process would take much longer, based on the hybridization of Darwin's medium ground finch, the Geospiza finch, and the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be formed into all sorts of shapes. It can be wrapped into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire, twisted, and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made extremely thin and applied to another metal. It can sometimes be made so thin that it was once used to decorate images in books, sometimes called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H within pH) ions in the chemical composition.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, then squeeze them together with clean, damp hands to form a ball.
The moisture on your hands interacts with the outer layers of the skin, creating a strange sensation and forming a protective film.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan civilization's cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which were used by both men and women.
You use a satellite when you call someone thousands of kilometers away from you.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and visibility.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket taller than 100 feet is required.
The wheel has changed the world in unimaginable ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to significantly simplify and accelerate transportation.
He brought us trains, cars, and other vehicles.
Below them were other mid-sized cats that preyed on medium-sized victims ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
After all is said and done, there are many small cats here (including stray domestic cats). They prey on many small predators and birds, such as insects, rodents, and lizards.
The secret to their success is the "niche" concept, where each cat has a specific role that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat species. They live in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of up to three related adult male lions, as well as thirty females and their offspring.
Usually, the females are closely connected to each other, forming a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like wolves and dogs, animals that are similar to lions (but not like other big cats), and are also very dangerous to their prey.
A good athlete can climb like a tiger (but not quite as well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Panthera genus) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. Only these four cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar with all its might; it's more like loudly spoken words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of the animals the ocelot hunts are smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots find the animals they eat by smell, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They have excellent night vision, allowing them to see very well in the dark and move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then suddenly attacking their victim.
When a small group (small population) of living organisms becomes separated from their environment (for example, if they are separated by a mountain range or rivers, or if they move to a new island from which it is difficult to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has diverse resources and various competitors, so the new generation will need different qualities and adaptations to be even more competitive than they needed to be before.
The initial population size hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new generation begins to adapt to its new environment, and its similarities to other generations gradually decrease.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
It had over 70 razor-sharp teeth along its long jaws and an additional set of teeth on the roof of its mouth, meaning no animal it encountered could escape it.
Although we don't know for sure, it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included: turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs. It may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex was no match for it.
While many of their foods were familiar to us, the Romans had strange or unusual foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another peculiarity was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to eat reclining on their hips.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's house.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctum that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The upper part of the tower was a sacred place, specially dedicated to God.
Because the climate of the Middle East is warm, a house was not so important.
Much of the life of a Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women were busy preparing things in the yard; the shops were open stalls facing the quiet street. Stone was used to build the houses.
Ancient Canaan did not have large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland has a sparse population. Norwegian sagas say that Erik the Red, banished from Iceland for manslaughter, discovered Greenland while sailing further west and named it Greenland.
But despite the discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though each country is "Scandinavian," there have been many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not right. Even though there's some information written on the back of the document, it's not a map that leads to treasure.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence Dated 4th July 1776". This text is at the bottom of the document, in translated form.
Although no one knew for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its life a large parchment document (its dimensions: 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up to protect it.
Thus, the notation might have simply been added as a marker.
The landing of Allied forces and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the southern part was still under enemy control.
It was the "Vichy" French who ruled it. These were the French who made a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 and, instead of fighting, collaborated with the occupiers.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in an assault known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is a common culture pertaining to a significantly large group of people in a society that live and work together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," meaning "citizenly" or "civil," which is related to the Latin word "civis," meaning "citizen." It is also linked to "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and together these terms define the scope of society to a certain extent.
City-states are precursors to nations. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-lasting cultural pursuits, and equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving behind proper historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress being its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to tax and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, relied on state authorities, who often declined to cooperate, to carry out its actions.
Furthermore, he did not have the power to repeal tax laws or tariffs between states.
Amendments to the articles required unanimous agreement from all states, and the states considered the central government so insignificant that their representatives often did not attend.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are more common in the northern regions. Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to its cluster/group of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's foundation began in the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of local grain production practices and recruiting Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki. According to it, it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan. Japan ruled this island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings on the periphery of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of how it originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, 35mm is the most common photographic format in the world. It was the dominant film size as the analog film era was coming to an end.
Today it is still produced, but its aspect ratio is derived from the formats of digital camera sensors.
In practice (which is confusing), the 35mm format has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common aspect ratios (such as the APS group of formats) are equal or close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, a widely used and often mocked principle, is a simple rule for creating dynamism in an image while maintaining a sense of order.
He says that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of lines. This divides the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was wealthy and powerful, came under strict control.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European countries, despite differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the core Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's financial resources are specifically intended for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for thousands of years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of war, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy, which halted the provision of necessary supplies to soldiers and civilians, proved effective. However, this blockade violated generally accepted international law, as enshrined in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
Because the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a majority of citizens and countries adhered to pacifist and isolationist views.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
Back in May, a signal consistent with that of a radio beacon was detected in the area, but nothing turned up that helped with the search.
In ancient China, there was a unique method of indicating different periods of time; each period of Chinese history or each family that came to power was a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of provinces divided among different dynasties. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce fighting among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands died fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, for example, the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
After the revolution, workplaces became open to all men, allowing them the opportunity to succeed.
It's the same in the military, because military ranks are now based on merit rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his daily life. He would often go to a cave known as "Hira" on the "Nur" (light) mountain to contemplate.
The cave that has survived the passage of time vividly reflects Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on a peak in one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, even if a person knows it exists, it's not easy to find. Once you descend into the cave, you become completely isolated.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third millennium BC, was one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, or the "Giza Necropolis," contains several pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, the largest), several smaller sarcophagi, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" sign resembles the symbol V, and the "down-bow" sign resembles a bracket or a square with the bottom side missing.
"Up" means starting from the tip of the bow and pushing the bow, while "down" means starting from the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pulling the bow.
Moving the bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while moving it downwards is more powerful and accented.
You can add your own markings, but keep in mind that the printed slurs are for musical reasons, so they generally shouldn't be touched.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, escorted by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats at the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
In a moment, one member of the group nodded their head towards the army of the royal guard in front of the terrified queen.
The Philippine people paid for the US war expenses in conquering the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to reimburse the bulk of the expenses and interest on bonds taken out in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the main benefit of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the reasons that led to the order's creation.
The events take place during the High Middle Ages (1000-1300 AD), a period in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and lasted until about 1500, after which came the Late Middle Ages.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas, from the notion that technological progress, or a technological imperative, governs human destiny to the stricter sense that underlying logic, tied to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology, dictates it.
Many explanations of technological determinism share two common ideas: technology develops autonomously, independent of cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, shapes societies with its own specific characteristics.
For example, one could say that motor vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically efficient for a small number of vehicles, therefore, new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Also, owning mass transportation leads to more accidents on roads, which leads to the invention of new methods in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged, which, because they were in harmony with society's place, were better than self-imposed laws.
Just as Paris is the fashion capital of the modern era, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as the epicenter of ceremony from approximately 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
In the twelfth century, its prestige declined. This was mainly because crusaders returned with gifts like silks and spices, which were considered more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was precisely at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments resulting from the crusades during this time was the use of buttons to close people's clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture in which a farmer and their family only produce enough food to meet their own needs.
Subsistence farming is a system that maximizes production using seeds preserved in an eco-region or simple methods, combined with a simple, organic crop rotation.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, which is still common in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite people with similar views who feel indifferent to social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary depending on the age, ethnicity, class, place of residence, and/or gender of their members.
Linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors can be considered as specific characteristics of a subculture.
Subculture members often signal their membership through the use of a distinctive style that identifies and marks them. This includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of connection is to present several unfortunate cases of children who were not taught to connect as adults, due to neglect, abuse, or intentional mistreatment during their upbringing.
Such children are called feral or wild. Some feral children were kept locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's severe intellectual or physiological pathology.
Homeless children may have witnessed or experienced violence or trauma against children before being abandoned or running away.
It is assumed that others were raised by animals; some say they lived on their own in the wild.
If only animals raise a child, that feral child will exhibit behavior almost entirely like that of its caregiver animal (within the limits of physical constraints), for example, its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning makes education easier and more interesting, over time the education goes beyond its scope.
Construction scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a type of assistance that supports individuals undergoing new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Pivots can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of pivot, but so is the little paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
It is embedded in a virtual tutoring software. They are designed to ask questions, provide advice, and offer explanations regarding procedures that students may have difficulty understanding on their own.
Children are given to adoptive parents for many reasons: neglect, abuse, and even demanding money.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where they are not taught, cared for, and educated, but such situations do occur.
We know that the foster care system ensures the safety of these children.
Our foster care system must ensure safe homes, compassionate caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The foster family must provide all the needs that were lacking in the adopted child's previous home.
The Internet combines general and interpersonal communication elements.
The unique characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "education" and "socialization" are cited as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
When investigating audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) found that the concepts of "personal involvement" and "continuous interaction" are new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to the discovery of significant new insights in interpreting micro-movements, movements of facial muscles, that last for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, one can detect a person's lying by interpreting micro-changes in their face.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrates how individuals who, due to brain damage, cannot understand language can nevertheless assess genuineness.
He even suggests the hypothesis that such abilities in explaining human behavior may exist in animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and visible.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of available variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variations between two pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it would be difficult for a primate, with a digestive system like that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
In addition to this, not doing so has severe consequences: slower growth, poor nutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest accessible plant resources were proteins available in leaves and legumes, but unless processed, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
On the contrary, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "nutrition problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Segmented sleep, also known as biphasic sleep, is the practice of waking intentionally during the normal sleep period and remaining awake for a short time (10-60 minutes) before going back to sleep.
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you tend to snooze your alarm clock in the morning, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or certain diuretic teas) before sleeping, which causes a person to wake up from sleep to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the anxiety, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own lack of enthusiasm and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded with the Mahayana path of compassion and many techniques derived from Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra, and visualization.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualizing various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II. This led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, the conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures led to the dissolution of the countries' alliance.
Within two years after the war ended, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the effects of it were fought for on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken. The only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight. After the Red Army of the Soviet Union, with 800,000 soldiers, invaded the eastern regions of Poland, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international (bilateral and multilateral) agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is still the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the work of naval forces has been to preserve the country's ability to move people and goods, while also hindering the enemy's ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War, in which Americans attempted to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Britain.
At that very time, the German Navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them to easily access milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often tended by a shepherd. These were often children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagon tracks were built early in England in the 16th century.
Even though the rails consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speeds and haul larger loads compared to the uneven roads of the day.
Sleepers were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that tracks were more effective if there was a metal component on top of the road.
This became common practice, but it wore out the wooden wheels of the iron wagons even more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of locomotion was walking, which people started doing around two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning, upright man) appeared.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk fully upright.
Bipedal species have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked upright as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly life, join an ecological movement, and even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This often looks like purely symptomatic treatment. However, unless we only need a temporary solution, we need to find the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed dramatically due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the unconventional lifestyles of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, the draft, signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop for multiple local distributions.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and they are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8th in Independence Courtyard.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
To date, the famous "25 Dunlop Sheets" are the oldest known copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not been preserved.
Today, most paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many things similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly skin and clawed feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
Currently, almost all computers in use are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
In a binary number, only one of two values can exist, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or, if we use computer jargon, bits.
Internal poisoning cannot always be detected immediately. Immediate diagnosis is not possible because symptoms like vomiting are among the common signs.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to this particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "insect" in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term has been known since ancient times as bed bugs, which are insects that use humans as a source of parasitic life.
Both cone-nosed bugs and bed bugs build nests, adapted to living in nests or on the body of the host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS). This makes it one of the most common neurological diseases in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop many forms of multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents lose their parental rights, and another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works through the scientific method. This method essentially guides the majority of scientific research.
However, he is not alone; experiments are a test used to conduct experiments and eliminate one or more of the experiment's potential hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on classical texts, including the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's perspective on all matters of science, including psychology, was accepted.
With the decline in knowledge of the Greek language, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often due to the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
It is documented that periodic rhythms that are not simply responses to external cues exist in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to generate rhythmic impulses even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
The American plan was based on coordinated attacks in three different directions.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural sites to enjoy natural scenery, including plants and animals.
Locally, there are activities such as hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and information about the ecosystem.
For example, going to see, photograph, and study orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns by car to go to work, and those who travel with them leave their jobs in those same towns.
This dynamic vehicle is connected to and supports a transportation system entirely based on private vehicles.
Currently, science indicates that this massive carbon economy has driven the biosphere out of one of the stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
You rarely hear about similar levels of complaints regarding water quality or bridge collapses in developed countries.
Why do vehicle systems generate so many complaints, and why do they fail so often? Are automotive engineers incompetent? Or is something deeper going on?
"Traffic flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows exhibit a degree of rational stability and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three fundamental characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road construction.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the ability to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, insects that cannot fold their wings along their backs are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought his idea was correct, but many believed the opposite; they thought the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It has up to 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Furthermore, the Amazon is the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide in some places.
20 percent of all the water in the planet's rivers that flow into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main section of the Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing ever surpassed the size of the Giza pyramids and the technical perfection of their construction.
The New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official relations.
Italian is the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of them can be found naturally in nature and are relatively easy to extract using simple tools.
The philosophy giant Aristotle created a theory that every object is made of one or more of the four elements.
It resembled the four states of matter (in the following order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it predicted that it would transform into new substances pertaining to the forms of matter we observe.
Alloys are primarily mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the world consists of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, due to the emergence of new writing methods, the importance of the pencil has declined, and it is used less frequently.
Nowadays, people can write messages on computer screens without approaching a sharpener.
When something new appears, one can only speculate about what the keyboard will turn into.
An atomic bomb works on the principle of obtaining energy by using many protons and neutrons to form a nucleus.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. The nucleus splits again, releasing some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning they are prone to splitting with little or no prompting.
The Moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
The ground under the dark areas is thin, while the ground under the light areas consists of thick rock.
The near side of the Moon likely has more lunar maria because the lunar crust is thinner there, making it much easier for lava to flow to the surface.
Content theories are based on discovering what motivates people or what they like.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized by adulthood.
These theories examine what makes certain people want certain things, or not want them, and what things in their environment cause them to perform certain actions, or prevent them from performing them.
Two popular content theories consist of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start leading former colleagues. On the one hand, they try to remain one of the former "colleagues" (or buddies).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an outsider, believing that all the actions performed by the group should be changed and done by themselves.
The leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to breakdowns in communication between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same high quality standards as regular teams, although there are minor differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for the physical team.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which local management may not understand.
Being a true "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The invisible team" means a leadership team to which each member is accountable. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why does an enterprise need to go through the lengthy process of creating a "learning organization"? The sole purpose of implementing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
Creativity and innovation can occur when all available resources are used effectively across the organization's functional departments.
Consequently, the process of organizing collaborative work to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership team must create a culture of innovation within it and ensure knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the "Continuum" approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying the concept of cognition, which narrows the scope of research and increases its accuracy.
The connection between brain pathologies and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental function.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes in ways never before possible.
This provides a wealth of data and materials to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
While AI has science fiction connotations, it constitutes a crucial area of computer science encompassing action, learning, and the application of consciousness in machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes creating machines designed to perform automated tasks that require intellectual activity.
Examples include managing, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines that provide solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields because they are embedded in several home computers and video game software.
Field trips are a great part of any classroom. It's remarkably common for a teacher to want to take students to places they can't go by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Presenting a virtual tour is also a great opportunity to collect feedback about the tour and share experiences in future lessons.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website each year about their trip to the state capital, and while the website is redone annually, older versions are saved online as an album.
Blogs also help students improve their writing. Although students often begin blogging with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since the audience consists of students with a critical mindset, the blogger strives to improve the quality of the content in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to be knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to arouse the audience's interest inspires students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend beyond the traditional school day.
Properly utilizing blogs can significantly enhance students' analytical and critical thinking skills. By actively responding to online materials, they can clarify their position regarding other people's writings, as well as express their viewpoints on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating, bilingual capital city, offering a wealth of art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's history and present.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, while to the north lies the pristine, untouched natural beauty of Muskoka.
All of this makes Ontario stand out, and newcomers often consider themselves Canadian.
Vast areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
A surprising population comparison: The number of African Americans residing in the US is greater than the entire citizen population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest and most wildlife-rich island that is practically its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as expensive beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the cape route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of their true family situation.
Also, wearing a ring is beneficial (it doesn't seem too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they might perceive as being presumptuous, and that pursuing, holding hands, etc., are common.
When rejecting men, be firm and don't back down from your decision (regardless of cultural differences, this is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. They only left after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and called it Dar Al-Baida, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the Old Medina, it's not difficult to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of jewelry, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is the easternmost tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, many streets of the city of Goma, especially those in the city center, were destroyed by lava flowing from the Nyiragongo volcano.
While Goma is sufficiently safe, it's best to do some research to understand the state of war in the North Kivu province before venturing outside of Goma.
Besides being a hub for the highly lucrative trade of mountain gorillas, the city serves as the main base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano in Africa.
In Goma, you can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). The standard (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Timbuktu, with its relative inaccessibility, began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, "Africa's Great Civilizations."
This city is very different from the rest of the country's cities because it has more Arab characteristics than African ones.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and stretches along the Mozambican border to the east, the Zimbabwean border to the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 square km and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each inhabited by different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, an environmental contribution and entrance fee are payable upon entry to the park.
It might also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card. It allows access to parks in South Africa or all national parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a major tourist attraction.
Hong Kong's skyline, a cluster of buildings, was compared to a bright bar graph, vividly visible with the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To enjoy the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island city consists of reclaimed land on its northern shore.
This is a place seized by British colonizers as their own property, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory being under colonization, this is a suitable place for your endeavor.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest single block of tidal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps — they contain some of the last remaining refuges of the vast jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers 3850 square kilometers. Approximately one-third of it is covered by wetlands/swamps.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the intercity bus station (along the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It's best to buy tickets a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Reliable and durable Japanese beach buses serve most of the districts.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to get to places like Paro (150) and Punakha (200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, with a length of 378 meters and two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
This bridge was planned to be fully operational in September 2017. This year, Brazilian customs posts are also expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting modern-day Eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, while also practicing rudimentary agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua. These tribes lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay emerged as a result of conflicts between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous population, previously known as the "Giant Province of the Indies."
The Spanish began a three-century-long period of colonization.
Since the founding of the city of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for being one of the best polo teams in the world and for having some of the best players.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December on the polo fields of Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, you can enjoy small tournaments and games here.
Get news from the Asociacion Argentina de Polo about the reselling of tickets for tournaments and polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at par.
You can exchange the money at the only bank in the islands, located opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
British Pound Sterling is accepted on all islands, along with credit cards like Stanley and US dollars.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, however, UK and US currency may be accepted; inquire about the preferred method of payment from the owner in advance.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it experiences summer when the northern hemisphere experiences winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures exceeding +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel much colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no pronounced "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park have become accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild, and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park administration, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Despite appearing calm, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so don't enter their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so don't carry or prepare fragrant foods, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port, there was a tragic confrontation of naval fleets in 1889, and seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
With the exception of one British cruiser, all ships were sunk. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the death of the high-ranking chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Oakland has many beaches because it is located on two harbors. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are provided with mostly safe-swimming sandy beaches, and many of them are lined with pōhutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious city-fringe suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with many shops along the coast. It's safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more widely distributed.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," a cappuccino has a lot of cream (without froth) added, and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although the fruit juices are expensive, they are excellent.
The reef experiences many trips throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Regardless, consult with authorities, consider all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish have been seen near beaches and river estuaries between October and April since 1770. Sometimes they can be found offshore during these times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Many sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their primary habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking guarantees that the traveler will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, however, you can also book alternative accommodations like campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport/hotel transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They will also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
Any amendments or queries should go through the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees prefer to stay on the grounds, with many participants considering this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should get up early to secure a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music on the main stages has ended, the festival may still have sections that continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, consider a cabin, as passing through the ice creates considerable unpleasant noise, especially impactful for those most susceptible to motion sickness.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see requirements).
Casinos typically invest significant effort in maximizing the time and money guests spend. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and exits are made difficult to find.
Typically, they have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and engaged.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered at home. However, intoxication impairs thinking ability, and all good gamblers know the importance of not being drunk.
Anyone traveling in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the potential for snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
You can't drive on icy and snowy roads as you would on bare asphalt because the friction is lower.
After blizzards, it can snow enough in a very short time for you to get snowed in.
Also, falling or blowing snow, or condensation or ice on vehicle windows can limit visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic often continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest draw for tourists in Africa and a must-do for many visitors.
The widely accepted meaning of the term "Safari" refers to traveling across land, especially the savanna, to see Africa's stunning wildlife.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and standard equipment allows for good viewing.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "bush walking," "hiking safari," or "walking safari") consists of hiking that lasts from several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other regions throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice.
If you booked your flights in advance and hotel reservations for 2020 were announced before the postponement, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but many coronavirus-related cancellation rules from the end of March will not be applied until July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It was expected that most event tickets would cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry faster. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for guests to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron isn't available or you don't have ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Do not allow the material to get too hot (this may cause shrinkage or scorching).
There are various effective ways to purify water when dealing with specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while others require several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pest animals in local areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst-case scenario, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save significant money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is considered the most challenging area on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it passes through isolated terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be prepared for: steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp turns will be prevalent.
The posted speed limits are unusually low compared to the sections before and after - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is important to obey them more strictly than others.
Interestingly, cell phone service is much stronger here compared to other areas of the route (such as the Pennsylvania Wilds region).
German dough products are noticeably good and in Bavaria, they are just as plentiful and varied as in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit-filled pastries are common. Among the pastries, those with apples are prepared year-round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often enjoyed with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try what is known as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, often with meat or vegetables added.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland areas of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Indonesian food, with its 17,000 islands to choose from, is a blanket term encompassing the wide range of regional cuisines found throughout the country.

Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet, hung on either side of a saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but there may be safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup and the horse bolts, they can be dragged. A number of safety measures have been implemented to minimize this danger.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a flat, relatively narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall away if a falling rider pulls back.

Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
This is associated with alpine-style ski touring or alpinism (but not usually), the latter being conducted on steep slopes and requiring rigid skis and boots.
Imagine a ski track similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover more distance than walking, but in very rare cases, you'll achieve cross-country skiing speeds on groomed trails without heavy backpacks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to apply for visas and go through passport control multiple times.
The Schengen area functions like a single country in this regard.
If you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member country, thus saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no common definition for items that qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as items older than 100 years.

Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami, and trade-related businesses are also important for many other professions.
Even according to tradition, some Sami people did not engage in large-scale reindeer herding, but subsisted on fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as pack animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.

After living abroad, when you return home, you'll be in a state of having adapted to a new culture and will have lost some habits from your own culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were polite and understanding, because they knew that travelers in the country needed to adapt to a new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are needed for travelers returning home.

Finland is a wonderful place to go boating. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," there are also thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
While coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for yachting, small boats or even kayaks offer a different feeling.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland. Approximately one in every seven or eight people owns a boat.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand fit this, but elsewhere it is significantly different (for example, in the Netherlands, this number is one in fourteen).
Most Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that in two days you can tour the historic city and return, sleeping on a ship at night.
You don't need a separate visa if you visit the shore only via boat tours (since 2009).

However, it won't be cheap: you can usually expect to pay four times more than a regular economy class for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Usually, even on direct flights from A to B, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats.
Airlines know that there is a specific group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the advantage of getting to a place quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic plagued by national contradictions.
