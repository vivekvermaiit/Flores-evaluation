Late in 2017, Siminoff appeared on the television shopping channel QVC.
Ring also settled a lawsuit with the competing security company ADT Corporation.
While an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the death rate of Ebola, no medicines have so far proven suitable for treating existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially seemed promising in the field, but formal studies indicated that it was less beneficial than expected in preventing death.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, which means that researchers used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments against it.
USA Gymnastics supports the US Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that our athletes, clubs, and their sport's interests may benefit more from pursuing meaningful changes within the organization than from decertification.

This confirmed not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also provided details that fossils generally cannot, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper part with a pale or carotenoid-colored underpart.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feather did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other feather characteristics — barbs and barbules — the researchers assumed that the rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggested they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show adult plumage and not down from a chick.

They found that the sun operated on the same basic principle as other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is when it comes to magnetic reversal.

The current senator, and Argentina's First Lady, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced her presidential candidacy last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers away from Buenos Aires.
Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentinian theater, the same place she used to begin her campaign for the senate as a member of the delegation in the province of Buenos Aires in 2005.
The debate was triggered by disputes over the spending of money on emergency aid and reconstruction following Hurricane Katrina, which some fiscally conservative people comically called "Bush's New Orleans deal."
Liberal criticism of the reconstruction efforts has been directed at the profit that the reconstruction contracts have provided to the incumbent insiders in Washington.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been a result of tidal forces between the galaxy and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth that causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affected other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the particularly resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "highly disturbing and alarming due to the high death rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have been infected with the virus in the hospital, and that at least two were healthcare personnel at the hospital.
Over the course of a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected, at any given time in South Africa.

After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods, which would spread sediment in the river, would be stopped.
This sediment was necessary to create sand dunes and beaches that served as habitat for wildlife.
As a result, two fish species have become extinct, and two others have become endangered, including the pink salmon.
Even though the water level will only rise by a couple of feet after the flood, officials hope that this will be enough to restore the eroded sand dunes downstream.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper ballot indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting form.
French electoral law codifies the treatment relatively strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the voting procedure and that no envelopes are added except those from carefully counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor every single part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close observation and by following specific procedures.

In her second run, giant slalom, she came in tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner Claudia Loesch, from Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth place Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their run, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in giant slalom failed to rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant Police Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have found her laptop and mobile phone."
The defendants are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki has said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver in the car nevertheless sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the crash happened was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the badly damaged Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with killing her son in Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting referral and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be manipulated as images of her have been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's legal system works differently, and the court has deemed the publication of the images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor at the University of Dundee, Pamela Ferguson, said "journalists appear to be taking a dangerous direction if they publish images and the like of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be given at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Pakistan wants based on the borders before the Middle East war in 1967.
Other topics covered, according to reports, include the future of the city of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the conflict over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian authorities only agree to such a presence for five years.
Marksmen in the supplementary pest control pilot project were to be thoroughly monitored by security guards while the effect of the pilot project was being assessed and monitored.
In partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to the acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the National Park and Wildlife Service, the first four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to a widespread anti-regime protest that began in October.
The occasionally violent protest was triggered by the fact that elections had not been held, some dating back to 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods overheating have been reported, leading to a total of six fires and four people experiencing minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in Japan said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, the Ministry of Trade and Industry announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more cases of overheating that the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "extremely regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management agency in the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage was reported in the commonwealth.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former policeman from the Philippines took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza used an M16 rifle when he shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, but it has been confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six hostages, the children and the elderly, were released at an early stage, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an older lady who had to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it could accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that investigators from the authorities had found the plane's two 'black boxes' with the sound recordings.
Other athletes also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said “Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as me...maybe even more so...love her and will miss her...hopefully she is in a better place."
According to a poll of 1400 people before the 2010 federal election, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 campaign for the federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the poll shared this view and wanted Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
At most, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, questions have been raised about his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, as they are illegal in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery by using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Thursday.
Comets may have been a source for delivering water to Earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets take shape, especially how the Earth took shape since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his position as governor earlier this month and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political talk and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the American aviation authority claims can allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with better precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport options have been put in place, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Additionally, parking and park-and-ride are not available at the venue.
Fear of lack of transport has hinted at the possibility that the matches will take place behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new bird species developed after only two generations, even though it was believed this process took much longer, as a result of breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostis.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled into very small forms.
It can be spun into thin thread that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered and rolled out into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Red cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants from the sewage system have been found in houses from the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were present together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite that is in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
It requires a large rocket that is over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster opportunities for transport.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other transportation units.
Below them are mid-sized cats that eat mid-sized prey, ranging from hares to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat a much more varied selection of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a specific job each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live together in large groups called prides.
Prides are formed of one to three adult male lions, together with as many as thirty lionesses and their cubs.
Lionesses are usually related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to a wolf pack or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a highly flexible athlete, the tiger can climb (though not so well), swim, run long distances, and drag with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that roar.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as the lion's, but more like a sentence of growling, howling words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They often catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by using their sense of smell, sniffing their way to where they have been on the ground.
They have night vision that allows them to see very well at night, and they also move very smoothly. Ocelots hunt by camouflaging themselves in their surroundings while they lie in wait for their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (such as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that it is difficult for them to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they came from.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, which means that the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a strong competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population has begun to adapt to their new environment, which is causing them to become more and more different from the other population.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (in other words, exhaling).
Plants make their own food from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not have survived.
In its time, Mosasaurus was an apex predator, so it feared nothing – except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw was surrounded by more than 70 needle-sharp teeth, and with an extra set in the palate. In other words, there was no way out for those who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. The diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs. He may even have been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that ended up in the water – even gigantic dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus Rex, were no match for him.
While most of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans still had some unusual dishes for their feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting down, rich men liked to have banquets together while lying on their sides when they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe or America from Asia in later centuries.
They did not have, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered their home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and an inner sanctuary to which only priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not particularly important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the farmyard; shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even though he made this discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Even though each of the countries was 'Scandinavian,' there were great differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct. Even though something is written on the back, there is no treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one can say for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage early in its lifespan.
It is therefore likely that the note was simply added as a marking.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not liberated.
It was governed by the French Vichy regime. These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and independent French forces had liberated the southern part of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture that is shared by a group of people of a significant size who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and in a way also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the drivers of nations. A civilizational culture insinuates the further transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lingering cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to become known as proper civilizations.
Through the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and since there was no executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The decisions required unanimous consent from all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, together with the Germany national football team, are the second most successful football teams in the world, and were FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in the international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to the clusters/groups of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geological perspective, as an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the indigenous people's grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the country until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed, and the rebuilding process continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital cameras' sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, a little confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest complete ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats for example) are similar to, or approximately the same as, this aspect ratio.
The much-criticized and often ridiculed rule about thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in the image.
It states that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound together European states, despite differences in language and customs.
It had an all-encompassing power that affected everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are there for exactly this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being met.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective as it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international laws, codified by several small international agreements over the past two decades.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent all ships from sailing into the entire sea area and inflicted damage on even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most inhabitants were pacifism and isolation.
Having witnessed the hardships and heartlessness of war during the First World War, nations desired to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to take a job at the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China and each family in power became a distinctive dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era which took place for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Throughout these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying while fighting to sit on the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism and republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were also open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applied to the military, as ranking was now based on skills instead of class, as it had been before.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people, from oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters outside his everyday life. He often used a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The mine itself, which survived through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual decline.
The mine sits on the top of the mountains north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
She is actually not easy to find at all, even if one knows that she exists. Once inside the mine, one is completely isolated.
Nothing but clear, beautiful sky can be seen above, and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the mine.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, and is one of the many pyramidal structures that were built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was made to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" marking looks like a V, and the "down-bow" marking looks like a pin or rectangle is missing from the bottom of it.
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually creates a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more definite.
Feel free to make your own markings, but remember that the markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people who screamed and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The mob of people forced the king and queen to have the windows of their carriage completely open.
At one point, a member of the mob held up the head of a royal guard, who had been killed in Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses, and interest on bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking.
The super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would, of course, constitute the fundamental achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that facilitated the order's formation.
The epoch when these events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a broad spectrum of ideas, from technology promotion or the technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: That the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
One can for example say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
A nationwide road network is nevertheless not economically viable just to serve a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the healthcare system discovering new techniques for treating injured people.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of the community, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation for being an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
This status was reduced during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what Byzantine markets could offer.
It was during this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital, from Constantinople to Paris, occurred.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, dress was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Due to slow communication channels, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time, as a result of the crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is practiced for the production of enough food to only meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses stored seeds originating from the eco-region, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
A member of a subculture often signals their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and argot.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is to highlight the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "wild" or unruly. Some wild children have been abandoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical difficulties.
Troubled children may have experienced child abuse or trauma, before being abandoned or running away.
Others have been claimed to have been raised by animals; some have been thought to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behavior (within physical limitations) almost entirely similar to that of the respective caregiving animals, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, constructivist design takes learning a step further.
Constructive design is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are engaged in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and are meant to question, guide, and clarify procedures that might have been too demanding for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We are looking at the child protection regulation as a safety zone for these children.
Our child welfare regulations are intended to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, and stable education, in addition to reliable healthcare.
Foster homes are not meant to cover all the needs that were lacking in the home they were taken away from.
The internet combines elements from both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet led to multiple dimensions regarding the approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, movements in the face that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to correctly assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills for interpreting human behavior may be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two reserves of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move variation back and forth between the two reservoirs with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to fulfill its need for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure in this has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available protein resources would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) digestible, but it also provides a high number of proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
Considering all of this, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in much the same way as chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of waking intentionally during your normal sleep period and falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a silent alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find that you reset the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before sleep, which will force one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center for Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. At the end of the war, the opposing systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries disagreeing.
With two years left until the end of the war, the two allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and was fought for real, by proxy forces, on battlefields from America to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken down, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans nevertheless became obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is clearly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, preventing your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent and noteworthy examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have managed to conquer Great Britain in addition to the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Animal husbandry was started in ancient cultures to have easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were normally kept in flocks that grazed on highland pastures or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or young people – a form of shepherd boys. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wooden railway tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though these rails consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they enabled the horses pulling the wagons to achieve higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. But little by little, it was realised that the rails became more effective if they had some iron riveted onto them.
This thus became common, but the iron led to greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the three-wheeled wagons were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transport is walking. Humans, that is Homo erectus (= the upright human), started walking upright two million years ago.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk regularly upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start being kinder to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future burdens to a certain extent.
In many cases, this is the same as treating the symptoms. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and thus solve them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humankind. And problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After the congress adopted the declaration on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the president of the congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks further away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in front of Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read the document aloud to the troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" that we know still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and live today. We call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs just like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always easy to detect. The symptoms (for example, vomiting) can be so diffuse that it is not possible to give a diagnosis right away.
The best indication of internal poisoning is an open pill box or toxic household chemicals left out.
Check the label to find out what kind of first aid you should give for the specific substance.
In a formal sense, entomologists use the term "insect" for this group of insects.
This term comes from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to be parasites on humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nidicolous animals, which are adapted to live in nests or the house of the host.
In the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, that is, the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
According to research, women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not the best for them, or the best for the child, to raise a baby.
These parents can choose to give the baby up for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works, through the scientific method. This method serves as a guideline for most scientific research.
But not only this. Experimentation is also used. An experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Bible, in Latin.
Aristotle's view on everything related to science was what was accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West was torn away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to external periodic signals, are documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle with periods in free-running cycles, even when there are no external signals present.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments where they either labeled the DNA in the phages with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the affected genetic material is, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to see the beautiful landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people take their cars and leave small suburbs to travel to work, while others pass them on their way to work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth transport, everyone is in some way connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Research now suggests that this massive CO2 economy has disturbed the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study traffic flow because one cannot predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable range. Traffic flows are therefore often somewhat stable and can be represented roughly mathematically.
A relationship has been established between the three main characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are useful when planning, designing, and using road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. The ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies, and they found food and mates faster.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings backwards along their body.
This means that they have more small places to choose from when they need to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some believed him, but many believed the complete opposite, that it was the solar system that moved around the Earth, including the sun (and all other stars).
It's not that strange, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It has more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places 9.5 km wide.
A full 20 percent of all the water that flows out of all the Earth's rivers and into the sea comes from the Amazon River.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6387 km long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none ever managed to surpass the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and outstanding technical execution.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the government, while Latin is often used during religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of these exist in natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These four elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Although he also created a theory that they change into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. And of course, we also have the metals silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that consist of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so extremely small that there is room for many trillions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend to many when it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and used less and less as newer writing methods have been introduced.
People now write messages on computer screens and never need a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When you then split the core again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to fall apart with little or no influence.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. We call the outer layer of the moon the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria (the dark areas) and thicker under the highlands (the light areas).
There may be several craters on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding out what motivates people, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as we become adults.
The theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want, and what it is in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can arise when leaders start leading colleagues who they were previously on the same level with. At one end of the spectrum, you have the leader who tries to remain "one of the gang".
This type of leader has trouble making unpopular decisions, reprimanding employees, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibility, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you have the leader who turns into someone unrecognizable, and who feels that he or she must change everything the group has been doing, and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for both the ups and downs in the group.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups maintain the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often serve as a point of contact for the nearest physical group.
They often operate more independently than conventional group members because their groups tend to meet across varying time zones, which may not be met with understanding by the local management.
The fact that the group is truly "invisible" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the management group to which each of the members reports. The invisible group sets the standards for each individual member.
Why should an organization go through such a time-consuming process as establishing a learning organization? One of the goals to be achieved by putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can flourish.
A result of this process, with an organization cooperating to overcome an obstacle, is that it leads to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organization can become innovative, the leadership must establish a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area is thereby narrowed and much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the researchers in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that can help us understand processes in the brain.
Even though "science fiction" evokes strong associations with artificial intelligence (AI), AI constitutes a very important part of computer science when it comes to dealing with the operation, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this may include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from customers, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, technology, and the military, and are embedded in several PC apps and video game devices.
Excursions are a large part of all teaching. It is quite often that a teacher might want to take the students to places one cannot travel to by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can view museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
Each year, for example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about the trip to the largest city in the state. Each year they rebuild the website, but keep old versions online as a kind of scrapbook.
Bloggers can also help students become better writers. Even though students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, it usually changes when they gain an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to make their writing better in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also means that "students are forced to understand the world around them better." The need to satisfy the audience inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn something outside the traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to material on the internet, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts and outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada where they speak two languages. Here you will also find a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's history and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and the northern part houses, among other things, the undeveloped and scenic Muskoka.
All of this and more highlights Ontario as what foreigners see as most typically Canadian.
Large areas further north have quite sparse settlements, and some areas are almost desolate wilderness.
Here is a comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans in the USA than there are inhabitants in Canada.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent of its own when it comes to animal and plant life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are linked to France, and known as luxury resorts with beautiful beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it had a great influence on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the regions are bound together by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the city was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, including tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in Congo that lies far east towards the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the city streets, especially in the center, were covered in lava.
It is relatively safe in Goma, but if you are traveling outside Goma, you must investigate carefully to find out what the situation is in the North Kivu province with regard to the ongoing conflict there.
The city is also used as a base camp for those who want to climb the Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also the starting point for those who want to experience one of the most affordable tours in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with the fact that it is relatively difficult to access, "Timbuktu" is often used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city with much poverty, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the city was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the major stops in Henry Louis Gates' program, Wonders of the African World, which aired on the PBS channel.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, since it is more Arabic than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east and Zimbabwe in the north, and in the south, the Crocodile River forms the border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with its own distinct animal and plant life.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa, and it is regarded as the flagship for South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park has conservation fees and entrance fees.
It may also be wise to buy a Wild Card, which gives free entry to either selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists see as the main goal of their visit.
The parade of buildings that makes up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart revealed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
You get the best view of Hong Kong if you leave the island and take a trip to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on embankments along the northern coastline.
This was the place the British colonizers seized as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km inland in Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans is on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The part of the forest that lies in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps. They encompass some of the last remaining stands of the enormous jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², and approximately one-third is covered with water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife and plant reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
As these intercity buses are often full, it's wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts have small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, for example Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017. By then, the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important ethnic group living in what is now called Eastern Paraguay. There, they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture as a livelihood.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá were also found, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay emerged, formerly called "The Giant Province of Indies," as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards started the colonization period that lasted for three hundred years.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of the distinctiveness and identity of its indigenous people.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields of Las Cañitas in December.
At other times of the year, one can see tournaments and matches on a smaller scale.
Contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo to learn more about tournaments and where you can buy tickets to polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which has a fixed exchange rate with the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will likely not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted. Contact the owners in advance to find out what is an accepted payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the islands, so you should do this before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropics, and in the summer months it is common with temperatures above +30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold. Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and high humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" or "dry" seasons. There is roughly the same amount of rain all year round.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild, and one should not feed or disturb the animals.
The Parks Department asks you to keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how docile they may appear, bison, deer, moose, bears, and most large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they have not kept a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them the space they need.
Additionally, you must be aware that smells attract bears and other animals. You should therefore avoid bringing or preparing food that smells, and the camp must be kept clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a special situation arose at the harbour when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships sank, with the exception of a British sailing warship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organised by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of the leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As a result of Auckland stretching between two harbours, there are many beaches there. The most popular are located in three areas.
The northern coastal beaches (in the North Harbour district) lie by the Pacific Ocean, and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming conditions, and most also have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches lie along the Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The local beer is called "Number One" and is not a complex beer, but good and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines would probably be a better choice.
Tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to get hold of if you want to be on the safe side.
A "flat white" would be foreign to an Australian. A small black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino is served with lots of whipped cream (not milk foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is usually of Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but good.
Many trips to the reef are arranged throughout the year, and it is rare for damage to the reef to occur as a result of this.
It is nevertheless wise to follow advice from the authorities and follow all signs and warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the small town of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be found at other times of the year.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travelers can be sure that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, for example at a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer package tours that include breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes combined flight and hotel packages.
It is also possible to hold the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or arrange other documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or inquiries should be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants choose to camp at the festival, and most participants believe this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has finished, there may be other places at the festival where music is played until late at night.
Some festivals have dedicated camping areas for families with small children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, you should check where your cabin is located. Some people will namely hear it extra well when the vessel passes through the ice. It's very noisy.
A cruise to St. Petersburg gives you some time in the city. There is no visa requirement for cruise passengers (check the conditions).
Casinos do what they can to ensure guests spend as much time and money there as possible. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find your way out.
There are often special prices on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and to make them stay.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but intoxication, as is well known, impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at higher latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that they may encounter snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility may also worsen due to falling or blowing snow on the road, or when condensation or ice forms on the car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to trips on land to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the vehicles, and standard equipment will provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes a bit shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") involves hikes that can last for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in different parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as they also hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the games were postponed, it may be difficult.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus will not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 JPY and 130,000 JPY, with the most common tickets costing around 7,000 JPY.
Damp clothes can become drier if you iron them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards to lend out, even if you don't always find these in the room.
If you can't borrow an iron, or if you don't want to wear wrinkled socks, you could possibly try using a hairdryer.
Be careful so that the fabric doesn't get too hot (which can cause the fabric to shrink or, in the worst case, leave scorch marks in it).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient, while in others you have to boil it for several minutes.
The filter efficiency varies, and if you don't feel completely safe, you can consider buying bottled water with a seal from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from home.
Pests can destroy food, be a source of irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with force, do not normally qualify as pests.
In duty-free shopping, one can buy goods exempt from customs duties and taxes in specific locations.
Travelers who are heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers very challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, and one must often drive through desolate forest areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you must keep a cool head when you encounter steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp turns, which are typical for this stretch of road.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than earlier and later stretches of road, usually 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph), and it is even more important than usual to follow them.
Oddly enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than on many other stretches along the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similarly to their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, where apples are added to baked goods year-round, while cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. These popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but mighty pastry, you can try what, depending on the area you are in, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry dishes are based on herbs and spices that are mixed with either meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes. In South India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if one uses it without further characteristics, the term usually means food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple, spiced dishes. The most dominant flavors that Javanese people like best are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups provide support for the rider's feet, which hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but this can be a safety risk because the feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse bolts. Several safety measures can ensure that this risk is minimized.
Firstly, most riders use riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, also have a safety mechanism that allows a stirrup to release from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a rider who is about to fall off.
The Cochamó Valley – the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a fantastic view. Climbers from many parts of the world are constantly creating new routes in the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where one slides down snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific place.
The idea behind skiing is very old. Cave paintings illustrating skiers have been dated back to 5000 BC!
Slalom as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This is also called wilderness ski touring, cross-country ski touring, or mountain ski touring.
The activity is related to, but does not normally involve, ski mountaineering tours in the high mountains or summit trips in steep terrain, which require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail you're going to ski as if it were a long hike on foot.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than if you walk, but it is very rarely as fast as cross-country skiing on prepared trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but which has many independent states. Usually, when one travels through several countries, one has to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
But the Schengen area functions almost like one country in this context.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through multiple passport controls.
If you have a Schengen visa, it works in the same way. You do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, thus saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, and the age limit may be lower in, for example, North America compared to Europe.
One can define handicrafts as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the activity is also important for many with other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and they have mostly used reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, i.e. Samiland.
Even though it is widely used, especially by people other than the Romani people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If travel advice has been issued for the country you are going to visit, this may affect your health insurance or cancellation insurance.
It can also be wise to check what advice is available from authorities other than your own, but remember that their advice is intended for their citizens.
American citizens in the Middle East may, for example, encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
What is presented here is often simplified, general, and simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the generic term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can lead to damage, serious societal consequences, or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, extreme precipitation, and fire are forms and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include heavy blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers should also stay informed about the risk of bad weather affecting the area, as this may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
With an internet search for "Hostile environment course" or "conflict management course" you will likely find the address of a local company.
A course normally covers the situations discussed here in more detail, and usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts 2–5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are several books and magazines about how to survive in the wilderness, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender-affirming surgeries abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
It varies how willing the authorities are to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender.
In addition, the willingness of authorities abroad to accept these documents varies.
Searches in security checks have also become far more intrusive in the time after September 11, 2001.
Before the operation, transgender people probably cannot expect to get through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Outgoing currents are currents of water from waves that have broken against the shore, and that recede, often at reefs and similar formations.
Due to the underwater topography, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper corridors, and here a rapid current can form out towards deeper water.
Most die as a result of exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it's no more difficult to swim back than normal.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught by the current again. Alternatively, depending on how much you can manage, and if someone has spotted you, it might be wise to wait for someone to rescue you.
Reverse culture shock can come faster than culture shock (fewer honeymoon days), and it can last longer and be more intense.
Those who have been out traveling, and who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, may have found it extra difficult when they have to adapt to their own culture again.
When they come home after having lived abroad, they have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits they had before.
When they traveled abroad, people were probably patient and accommodating at first, since it takes some time for travelers to adapt in a new country.
Perhaps not everyone is equally patient and welcoming when the travelers return home, but this is just as important.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most exciting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and the light is like a history book.
The Sphinx forms a backdrop and stands as the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations. They have the most stations, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular and natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on this side of the peninsula merge into the plateau, but reappear later to form a 360 km long mountain range in the form of the Ellsworth Mountains, with the Minnesota Glacier cutting between them.
The northern part, Sentinel Range, has the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, which has a peak that rises 4892 meters above sea level.
In remote locations where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a good replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational craft, and during expeditions that require external data and voice services.
The local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among students who have completed a course of study and can take a gap year before starting university, without it affecting their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during your gap year can give you better chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
Usually, one must pay a tuition fee to enroll in such educational programs.
Finland is a great boating destination. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are definitely large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g., the number in the Netherlands is one to forty).
Most common cruises in the Baltics have a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historical town for two full days, but you'll return to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on excursions arranged on the trip, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
It can be scary to travel by plane for people of all ages and with different backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
There's nothing to be ashamed of. It's not so different from fear and aversion to other things, which very many people have.
For some, understanding more about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not being in control.
The delivery company gets well paid to deliver things quickly. Time often matters a great deal when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, this was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, it could have taken several days with unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only thing that worked to get them through faster was to send them as checked baggage. The airline's regulations don't allow sending baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
You just have to cough up a stack of bills (or, ideally, have your company do it for you) if you want to fly first class or business class.
This isn't cheap, and as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the regular economy class price for business class, and eleven times more for first class.
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for cheap tickets for business class or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a specific group of air passengers who are willing to pay very high prices to be able to travel somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic where there have been many ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistria republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency. However, this is not recognised by any of the UN member states.
Economic cooperation has been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million. The city has the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good transportation hub.
What once was the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial city center that surrounds a large bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, glass buildings and modern shopping centers have traditional red roof tiles, a square from the 18th century and old mosques and churches, although the atmosphere of the city is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one can see interesting marble sculptures of doves above some gravestones.
It's worth strolling around the captivating village for half an hour or so.
To the north and within reasonable distance lies the romantic and fascinating village of Sintra. The town became known to foreigners when Lord Byron so brilliantly conveyed how magnificent it was here.
Scotturb bus no. 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can visit the great sanctuary Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), where Mary appeared several times, stories that are known all over the world.
Remember that you are simply visiting a mass grave and a place that means infinitely much to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived the time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here, both Jews and others.
The place deserves to be shown dignity, reverence, and respect. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by drawing or writing on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only in Catalan, because according to the law it is the official first language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in connection with public transport and other services.
Regular announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, while unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it's often a misunderstood stereotype, you'll manage best in Paris by behaving in the best possible way, like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). Then it will be much easier to get around.
A seemingly brusque exterior quickly disappears with Parisians if you are fundamentally polite.
Plitvice Lakes National Park contains a lot of forest, mainly beech, spruce and coniferous trees, and has a mixture of alpine vegetation and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a particularly wide selection of plant communities due to the range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitude levels.
The area also has an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Here one finds rare fauna such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie, along with many more common species.
Women visiting monasteries must wear skirts that cover the knees, and the shoulders must also be covered.
Most of the monasteries lend shawls to women who haven't thought of this. But if you bring your own, especially one with light colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Likewise, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
It is also possible to borrow clothes from the collection at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable using them. The sizes fit all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like in similar areas in the Mediterranean, uses a lot of bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) in addition to olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli. This is bread with olive oil, tomato, and available flavorings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the word Sie (You), always start with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
In that way, it is easier to distinguish between individual verbs and objects.
It also makes the reading easier, even though the writing is somewhat complicated because you have to figure out if a verb or adjective is being used in a noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the vowel that follows.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: Caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, this introduction to grammar can teach you a lot about Persian grammar and how you can understand sentences better.
If you know a Romance language, it will naturally be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, it's easy for those who know a little Spanish to quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that one doesn't need to study it separately.
Observatories built before modern times are largely obsolete today and remain as museums or teaching buildings.
Since light pollution was not a problem at that time, we usually find them in cities or on university campuses where they are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Today's modern research telescopes are often enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossoms were arranged by the emperor, and they were only for him and other members of the aristocracy in the emperor's court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so don't give in to the temptation to "just take one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden, taking a "specimen" will almost certainly be grounds for being shown the door.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, and it is easy to get around. You can also find almost anything after you have arrived.
But when you live in a tropical climate just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (continuously) and strong sun (when it's cloudless, which is rarer).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes all the way to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great basis for your vacation.
You can, for example, visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also the starting point for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide have adopted many of the traditions of the holiday.
It is a tradition to stay awake on Easter night and watch the sunrise in the open air.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a spring and fertility ritual with roots in pre-Christian times.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, where the congregation often breaks into celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally came to the islands arrived swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since humans came to the Galapagos, several mammals have arrived, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Then there are good conditions for seeing the northern lights, since the sky is dark more or less all day.
As the population is spread out over the areas and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to look at the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what people from the West are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and employees address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, and emphasis is placed on teamwork rather than praise for individual achievements.
Employees often need to get approval from their superiors for all decisions that need to be made, and they are expected to follow instructions from their superiors without questioning.
