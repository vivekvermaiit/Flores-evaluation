A cocktail of antibiotics, ZMapp, initially seemed to offer some hope, but formal studies have demonstrated that it does not have the efficacy that was believed in inhibiting mortality.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, that is to say that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and understands the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all their athletes.

This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already common, and it provides details that fossils generally cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists said that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on the upper part and white or carrot-colored on the lower part.
The discovery also gives information on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but they had other characteristics of feathers, barbs and barbules. Researchers have deduced that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development that occurred later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers have suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has the feathers of an adult and not the down of a hatchling.
The researchers suggested that, even though this might be the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has the feathers of an adult and not the down of a fledgling.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is linked to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is regarding magnetic reversals.

The effect that the team is going to look for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon has an attraction on the Earth and makes the tides rise and fall, so the Milky Way has a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
That theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is arranged in something that looks like a halo and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech affair: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed ballot indicating their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the voter's identity, he puts the envelope in a ballot box and signs the electoral register.

The candidates can send representatives to oversee all phases of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under supervision and according to specific procedures.

The law requires that violent video games sold in the state of California be labeled with a sticker that says "18" and makes their sale to a minor punishable by a fine of 1000 dollars per offense.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, released a statement this morning announcing the charges against Huhne and Pryce.
Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by Ed Davey MP. The MP Norman Lamb is expected to take over the ministerial post that Davey is about to leave.
Huhne and Pryce are expected to appear at the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla received injuries to his arm and face, and Kristoffer Schneider had to request reconstructive surgery for his face.
Uka's gun malfunctioned even though it was aimed at a fifth man's neck. Schneider always has a duel, is blind in one eye, a section of his skull is missing, and a mustache rebuilt in titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his homeland.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
Her first race was the Slalom, where she obtained a Did Not Finish in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors obtained the same result in that race.
The other race, the Giant Slalom, saw her slip to tenth position in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who was ranked first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers from the women's group in the session did not manage to finish their runs and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not manage to classify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
The Deputy Inspector General DK Arya declared: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendant appeared in court with his face covered.
Even though there were three people inside when the car crashed into the house, nobody got hurt.
However, whoever was working with the machine sustained some serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was closed for a period of time while the emergency services freed the man who was driving the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with murdering her son.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but all the ocular evidence could be contaminated because his image has been widely publicised.
This is a common practice in other places in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee observes that "journalists will be treading a dangerous path if they publish photographs or similar things of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is the general prosecutor, has told journalists that no further comments will be issued until at least the indictment.
According to news reports, the document will address the dispute over the borders that Palestine claims based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
According to what has been reported, other arguments discussed included the future of Jerusalem, a sacred city for both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA (Palestinian Authority) agrees to that military presence but only for a period of five years.
The traps for the supplementary test for controlling pest animals had to be checked after the rangers, because the test was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, within the scope of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for conservation and heritage at the NPWS park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received safety instructions and complete training.
Martelly swore in yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It's the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the IEC (Independent Electoral Commission) first, as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the Martelly's response to the anti-regime protests that were happening all over the country, which started in October.
The protests, some of them quite violent, stemmed from the lack of elections, some of which have been awaited since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating iPods that malfunction have been reported, which has caused six fires in total and left four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has declared that they are aware of 27 incidents concerning the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that it had informed Apple of another 34 incidents of overheating, which the company defined as "not serious."
The minister responded and called Apple's postponing of the report a "deplorable fib."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM (09:19 GMT).
The office that deals with emergency management has said that no damage has been reported in the nation.
However, the Tsunami Control Center also stated that there were no signs of a possible tsunami.
A Filipino man who had also been a policeman hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been rescued, although for now they've said that six are dead.
His hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early. The Filipino photographers were also released with them.
The photographers were positioned where an old woman had freed up the spot to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was then killed.
He grew up next to his father's cemetery and began a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Being someone who worked at the hospital, Liggins started investigating premature birth during his free time.
Their research has demonstrated that the administration of a hormone could accelerate the lung maturation of the fetal lung of the baby.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators recovered the two black boxes.
Even the wrestlers, who are her colleagues, paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, as she was. A courageous woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was even crazier than me….maybe even more than me….I loved her very much and I will miss her….I hope she is in a better place.”
Of the 1400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, those who opposed the transformation of Austria into a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the participants in the survey believe in that idea and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the next monarch of Australia.
According to the latest poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist should have swam in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because he complained about his physical condition, he is now in doubt.
He couldn't get the medicines he needed to overcome the pain because they were banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people have verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a way to bring water to Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth formed, considering that comets crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, started his term at the beginning of this year and last month he signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He defined the votes as "political fallacies and stupidities".
It has been hypothesized that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly on shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel every year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It will use satellite technology instead of the old technology that used ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport has been planned and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley and the park and ride facilities will not be available at the plant.
Due to the lack of transportation, there is a possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was believed that it would take longer for this process, which occurred due to reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic to the island (Geospiza fortis) and the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small, fine shapes.
It can be drawn out until it becomes a very thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal. It can be made so thin that it can be used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in the books called "decorated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
There are hydrogen ions which are protons that are stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix together two dry powders and then, with clean, damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel uncomfortable and will form something that looks like a needle.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with a well in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of such sewage systems have been found in Minoan and Santorini cities in Greece.
There were baths even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of public baths where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When someone calls you who is thousands and thousands of miles away, you know you have to use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it down almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
They had a giant rocket bigger than 100 feet to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in unbelievable ways. The most important thing that the wheel has done for us is making transport easier and faster.
He brought me the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Beneath them are felines of medium size that prey more than other animals, aside from rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are so many small felines (including domestic cats that live outdoors) that they prey on the most numerous smaller animals such as insects, mice, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of nitsche, a special job that a feline has that allows them to live without competing with others.
Lions are felines that are more sociable, as they live in large groups called prides.
The lion pride is made up of two to three adult males related to each other and with a maximum of thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other, because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Red foxes behave similarly to wolves, animals that resemble lions quite a bit (but they are not big cats) in their behavior and can also be dangerous for the animals they hunt.
A lively athlete, the tiger is good at climbing (even if not very well), swimming, jumping long distances, and pulling with a force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger is part of the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but it sounds more like growled and shouted words.
Owls like to eat small animals. They eat monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals hunted by owls are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that small birds fly straight and find animals to eat thanks to their sense of smell, and they are born where the animals that they eat must have been on the train.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and can also move silently. The owls camouflage themselves with what is around them to hunt the animals they eat and then they pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from where they come (for example, if they move to the mountains or across a river, or if they go to a new island in a way that they cannot easily return), they will often find an environment different from the one where they were previously.
This new environment, which has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need to develop different characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor like in the environment they were left.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it doesn't need new adaptations.
Over time, even if the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to resemble the old population less and less.
In a few decades, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they could no longer be defined as the same species.
That process that we call speciation, that is, to put it more simply, the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is an important part of the process of evolution.
Plants use oxygen that we need to breathe, and they take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants use sunlight to feed themselves through photosynthesis and produce shade.
We depend on plants for our houses and our clothes, the biggest part of the food we eat and they are plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
The mosasaurus was the strongest of all the dinosaurs and it wasn't afraid of the others.
Its jaws have 70 sharp teeth and other teeth on the roof of its mouth. You cannot escape when it catches you.
It's possible that he had a forked tongue. He ate turtles, fish, and possibly even other mosasaurs if he was a cannibal.
The wave swept away everything that came within reach, even a big dinosaur like the T-rex couldn't escape.
Even though most of their food would be known to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange and unusual banquet dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snakes, and a type of dormouse called "gira."
Another difference was that poor people and women ate sitting down, while the gentry liked to feast together and recline while they ate their meals.
The meals of ancient Romans could not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they didn't have melons, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no Roman had ever tasted the turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then a sanctuary inside where only the priests could enter.
Once upon a time, towers made of special clay in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
The great part of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just openings that faced the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There weren't many large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for homicide, and when he travelled west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, at that time the Inuit were already living there.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the traditions, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that behind the Declaration of Independence there was a treasure map drawn.
All things considered, it's not true. Despite there being something written behind that document, it's not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The writing is located at the bottom of the document, on the reverse side.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that at the beginning of its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was kept as a scroll.
Therefore, it's possible that the notation was added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by Vichy France. These were French people who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies entered the south of France, and the invasion took the name "Operation Dragoon".
In two weeks, the American and Free French forces were liberating the south of France and were moving into Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it also defines in some way the dimension of society.
City-states were the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization implies the passage of knowledge between various generations, a cultural imprint that persists, and a fair diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and may not be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government—Congress was the only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress didn't have the power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who often didn't cooperate, to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island country in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, it is often indicated, geographically, as an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century, when European sailors in passing recorded the name of the island as Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southeastern Taiwan and began the transformation of indigenous millet production practices and hired Chinese labor to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) had taken control of the coastal areas in western and northern Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it gave the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings at the edge of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they looked originally.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most popular still image photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still done today, but above all its aspect ratio has been inherited from the sensor formats of digital cameras.
In reality, the 35mm format can be confusing, it's actually 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of its format (must be divided by twelve times to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Several popular formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are the same as or very close to this aspect ratio.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in the image.
It is said that the most effective spot for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, vertically and horizontally (see the example).
In this era of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put on trial.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the countries of Europe even though there were differences in language and custom.
His power was divided and dominated the lives of all, from sovereigns to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to help poor people and that the church's money should only be used for that reason.
The central authority of the Christian church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether these principles were being respected.
Soon after hostilities broke out, Great Britain undertook a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective and cut off military supplies and provisions for civilians, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international laws codified in various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain was mining international waters to prevent all ships from entering entire sections of ocean, and was also causing danger for neutral ships.
Given that there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the most prominent attitude of the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolationism.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid the same situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla had moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.

Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each Chinese phase or each family in power had a distinctive dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable moment of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were wars raging between the many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died in combat to see the throne go perhaps too often to the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are several social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were open to all male candidates, and the most ambitious and successful could triumph.
It's the same for the military because instead of classifying the army by class, now they were classified by caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many working-class people repressed in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions beyond worldly life. He often frequented a cave that had become known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which had survived the time, gave a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
It is situated on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, it's not easy to find it even if you knew it exists. Inside the cave there is total isolation.
One can see nothing but the beautiful clear sky above and the steep mountains all around. From inside the cave, one sees and feels very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures that were built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the most imposing), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The "arch up" sign looks like a V, and the "arch down" sign looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Upwards means that you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and downwards means that you have to start with the heel (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Playing with the bow upwards usually creates a softer sound, while playing with the bow downwards creates a stronger and more decisive sound.
You can write your marks in pencil, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The unfortunate King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a crowd of market women.
Yesterday they returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
A member of the gang shook the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the United States' imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
Yesterday they were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Naturally, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would have been the basic earnings of the United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the environment that led to the creation of the order.
The time when the events occurred is commonly called High Middle Ages, the period of European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Central Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is an expression that encompasses several ideas, from the impetus of innovation to the technological imperative, which in a strict sense would be thinking that the destiny of mankind is guided by a profound logic linked to scientific principles and their application within technology.
When we talk about technological determinism, there are two main ideas: one that technological development doesn't just follow culture and politics, and the other that technology isn't conditioned by society but manifests itself within it.
For example, one could say that the motor car leads to the development of roads.
The roads of an entire country are expensive and need to be used by a lot of cars, so they thought about cutting the costs that people have to maintain their car.
The more people who have cars, the more accidents there are. Therefore, they have developed new healthcare technologies to deal with these people who need to be cared for.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the Romanticism environment, geography shaped people, and over time traditions and cultures linked to that geography were born, and if they were in harmony with that place in society, they were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is now the fashion capital of the world in our time, Constantinople was that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of prized products began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine market could offer.
It was in that moment that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was profoundly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could remain 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that time was the result of the Crusades, and people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of their families.
Subsistence agriculture is simple, often organic, and uses seeds native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other rather simple techniques to maximize the harvest.
In history, a large part of the peasants were in subsistence agriculture, a situation still present in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together people who think alike and who feel neglected by social standards, and they make them develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several elements.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging with a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take those few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults when they were growing up.
These children were called "wild". Some wild children were confined by people (usually their father and mother); in other cases, the abandonment of the child was caused because the father and mother rejected the heavy intellectual and physical limitations of the child.
Wild children may have experienced significant childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is presumed that others were raised like animals; it is said that someone lived alone like a savage.
When he has been completely raised by non-human animals, the feral child demonstrates behaviors (with physical limits) that are almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal he lives with, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
If project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting, the support system goes further.
The support system isn't a method but rather a help that provides support to those who encounter a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The support system can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of support but also the animated paperclip in Microsoft Office.
The virtual support is inside the software and it is there to discuss, suggest and explain those procedures that could be difficult for the student to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not protective, caring, and educational, but it happens.
I don't think that the foster care system is a safe place for these children.
Our system should provide safe housing, reliable carers, stable education, and dependable healthcare.
The foster care system should provide everything necessary that was lacking in the homes from which the children were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet led to further dimensions of use and gratification.
For example, "to undertake" and "to socialize" are believed to be important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" have been identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reaction to websites.
The aforementioned video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is thought that it is possible to understand if a person is telling lies through the interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his writing *The President's Speech*, suggested that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately gauge sincerity.
It is even suggested that these abilities in the interpretation of human behavior could also be seen in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation forward and backward between the two pools of each generation.
In the savanna, for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, it is difficult to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant resources.
Furthermore, the impossibility of doing so has important consequences: slowing down of growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily available plant resources would have been the proteins from leaves and legumes, even though they are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest and also provides noble proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Given the facts, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way as chimpanzees in the savanna today.
Dream interruption is the process of waking up intentionally during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep immediately afterwards (10-60 minutes).
It can be easily achieved with a rather silent alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you happen to snooze the alarm when you're sleeping, you can position it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm involve drinking a lot of liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), which forces you to get up to pee.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is linked, on the contrary, to the amount of tension within their body and spirit.
The lower the ego, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find total peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders our goal is our tension and being negative.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by Indian yoga techniques.
Overall, Tibetan Buddhism is really simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love towards everyone and everything.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deities. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, and it led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clashes of the system, of the processes, and of the cultures led to the division of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would have lasted for 40 years and been truly fought by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already in ruins and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost completely overturned overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Russian Army entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is really the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the job of sailors was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move its people and its goods, and at the same time interfere with the ability of your enemy to move their people and their goods.
One of the most important recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that the Germans would have been able to conquer Great Britain as they had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had begun to keep them (likely referring to animals) due to easy access to the lake, wool, meat, and hides.
Usually, domestic goats were kept in mountain huts that moved around on hills or in other grazing areas, often managed by young goatherds who were children or teenagers, almost like well-known shepherds. These methods are still used today.
Animal-powered systems were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Even though animal-powered transport systems were mainly made of wooden axles, they allowed draft horses to travel faster and transport larger loads compared to the more uneven roads of that time.
The sleepers were invented quite early to keep the rails in their place. However, it was gradually understood that the rails would be more efficient if they had a steel part on top.
This had become common practice, but the asphalt caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by steel wheels. In 1767, the first all-steel railroads were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (which means the upright man).
His Australopithecus ancestors didn't usually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus already walked on two feet seven million years ago.
We can start living more respectfully of the environment, we can join an environmental movement and even become activists to reduce the future ordeal to some extent.
In many cases, it's really like a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the technological and scientific progress of humans, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the original way of life of humanity.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten and signed copy by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap, located a short distance away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The document had been read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and it was read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 drafts of Dunlap that were known about, they are still there, they are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are so many kinds of birds that still look like those of the dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically, all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only take one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use the computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it's not possible to do an analysis right away.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open box of medication or of toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
Scientists often exaggerate when they talk about tiny things.
This name derives from the fleas that lived inside people's houses and bit (them).
Fleas are assassins and then also those of lice, they live in their nests or wherever they find to stay.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is the disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women have a probability twice as high of getting MS compared to men.
A couple might decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the child's best interest.
These couples could choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
With adoption, the natural father and mother relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides the majority of scientific research.
However, it's not only theory because scientific research is also guided by experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, making questions and observations.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
The opinions of Aristotle on every scientific question, including psychology, had been adopted.
With the decline of the knowledge of Greek, the West found itself separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Several rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often fundamentally linked to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which aren't simply responses to periodic signals from outside, have been documented in most living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are oscillators that maintain themselves, continuing a free-running cycle even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into a bacterium.
Yesterday they did two experiments, labeling the DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeling the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells involved are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the intention of enjoying the landscape, with wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in their cars to go to the place where they work, and they cross paths with those who are going to work in the destination that is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation network, everyone is connected in some way and they support a transport system based on private cars.
Now science shows that this grand carbon economy has withdrawn the biosphere from one of its stable states that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about the quality of the water or about bridges that collapse.
Why do transport systems create such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
It is unfortunate that the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
It's fortunate that drivers tend to behave within a fairly constant range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented with mathematics.
To better understand the flow of traffic, the relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and management of road infrastructures.
Insects were the first animals to achieve flight. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives it a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are mayflies and dragonflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
One person thought he was right, but other people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, and also the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems strange, because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It transports more than 8 times the water transported by the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles in some places.
20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It gets its water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the language used every day by those who work within the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People knew basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, because these can all be found in nature in their original form and are quite easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, thought that everything was made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he thought they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that many elements are from the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. It is obvious that there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It can also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of newer writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a status and use that is smaller.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to get close to a pencil.
I'm going to wonder what the keyboard will become when something new arrives.
A fusion bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. If the nucleus splits again, then it releases some of that energy.
In this atom, there are unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the plateaus.
There could be more old sea in the nearby side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come up to the surface.
Content theories are focused on researching what motivates and pleases people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized through experiences during their upbringing until adulthood.
These theories look at what makes people want to do the things they want to do and what things in their environment make them do or not do those things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, there are two behaviors that emerge when managers start to manage their former colleagues. On the one hand, there's an attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or lads).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, giving evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, one becomes an unrecognizable person who feels compelled to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
In the end, the leader is fundamentally responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams meet the same quality standards as normal teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact for their local physical group.
Often they have greater autonomy than normal team members because their teams may be located in different time zones that may not be understood by their local administration.
The presence of an "invisible team" true (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a characteristic of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administration team to which each member reports. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Why should an organization face the long journey of becoming a learning organization? One objective for putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are well used in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that satisfies the needs of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the area of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for quite some time that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental function.
The arrival of new technologies allows us to see and study the structures and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides them with a lot of information and materials to create simulation models that help them understand the processes in our mind.
Even though Artificial Intelligence is strongly linked to science fiction, it forms a fairly important part of computer science, and it concerns the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in Artificial Intelligence concerns the construction of machines to automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
For example, control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer analyses and requests, and also handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These topics are becoming separate subjects, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial Intelligence is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, because it has been put into many software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of all classes. Often a teacher would like to take their students to a place where a bus trip isn't possible.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire superb works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual tour of the virtual field is also a perfect way to think about and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online as a portfolio.
Even blogs can improve students' writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes things.
Given that students are often the most critical audience, the blogger is starting to make an effort to improve their writing to avoid being criticized.
Maintaining a blog also "obliges students to become more expert in the world around them." The need to feed the public's interest gives students the motivation to be more intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Maintaining a blog is a tool that encourages collaboration, motivating students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs "can allow students to become more analytical and critical; through an active response to materials on the internet, students can define their positions in the context of the writings of others and also describe their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the marvelous capital of Canada where two languages are spoken and which has a series of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
To the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north it hosts the pure natural beauty of Muskoka, and that's it.
All of these things and many others define Ontario as what is typically considered Canadian by foreigners.
Large areas further north are not very populated, and some are wilderness, almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises everyone: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa.
When we talk about wild animals, Madagascar is the biggest and it is itself a continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, or linked to France, and known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had a great diffusion in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama found the route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended to all women who travel by day to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also useful to put on a ring (not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
It's hard to be tough in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese had dismantled it and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, before abandoning it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan had the city rebuilt as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by the Spanish merchants who had established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a great variety of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried all its streets and its center.
Goma is quite safe, but if you go outside, it's better to understand what's happening in the province of North Kivu, which is always at war.
From Goma, people leave to climb the Nyiragongo and it is also one of the places where it costs little to see mountain gorillas.
In Goma, you can use the boda-boda (a motorcycle that acts as a taxi) which costs you 500 Congolese francs to get to a nearby place.
Besides its not-so-accessible location, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its name makes it a tourist attraction, and it has its own airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops of the "Wonders of the African Civilization" by Henry Louis Gates, distributed by PBS.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is on the southern border.
The park is 19,500 km² large and is divided into 14 ecozones, with each one protecting different wild animals.
It is one of the major attractions of South Africa and is considered the pride of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are costs to enter the park and for its daily conservation.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider the center of attention.
The row of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shining graphic that is highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront.
The great majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonizers took as their own, and so if you are looking for proof of the territory's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests aren't just mangrove swamps, but they have within them some of the last remaining parts of the great jungles that once occupied the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans occupy an area of 3850 km², of which about a third is occupied by areas of water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wild animals, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer with spots in the area.
The buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most of those going towards the east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the interdistrict buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
The majority of the districts are served by small Japanese minibuses that are comfortable and robust.
Taxis are a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) or Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints should be finished.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that lived in what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "the great province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish had begun the period of colonization that had lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay had managed to maintain a large part of its character and its indigenous identity.
Argentina is well known for being one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Even minor tournaments and matches can be seen here in other periods of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) and its value is fixed at the same level as the British pound sterling (GBP).
The currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and often in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
On the outlying islands, it is possible that credit cards will not be accepted even if British and US currency may be fine; check with the owners in advance what a good payment method is.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Just as Montevideo is south of the Equator, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, it is common to have temperatures above +30°C.
Winter can seem cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity mix together and it feels colder than what the thermometer says.
There isn't a particularly "rainy" or "dry" season: the amount of rain is more or less the same throughout the year.
These park animals are quite used to seeing humans, but they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
Despite how docile they may seem, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Also keep in mind that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food with strong odors and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a notorious naval blockade when seven ships arriving from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain were refused permission to leave the port.
All the ships had been sunk, except for a British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans had died.
The struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city, had resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
It has many beaches, considering that Auckland is located between two harbours. The most famous ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches, you can swim safely and stay in the shade of the pohutukawa trees on the far side of these beaches.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the area near Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are three beaches often full of families with many shops one next to the other near the coast. One can also swim without problems.
The main local beer is the "Number One", it's not a complex beer but it's good and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are quite a few French wines to sell, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The tap water is perfectly fine to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but very good.
All year round they make many trips to the coral reef, and accidents on the reef resulting from these reasons are rare.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, respect the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish live near beaches and river estuaries north of 1770 from October to April. Sometimes they can be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although through a travel agency it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Often travel agencies offer packages that include breakfast, organization of transport to/from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotel.
You can also cancel the booking if you need time to think about the offer or provide further documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any changes or requests must be submitted to the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of participants at music festivals decide to camp on site, and a large proportion of participants consider it a necessary element of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to arrive early to find a place to camp near the music.
Remember that even if the music from the main stages may be finished, there might be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
This festival has special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin because crossing the ice makes a terrible noise for the more sensitive people.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the regulations).
In general, casinos strive to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Usually there are no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
Usually, they offer special deals on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them close.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, drunkenness compromises judgment, and all gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the grip is low and you can't drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, a lot of snow can fall in an instant, enough to get stuck.
Visibility may be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation and ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are now normal in several countries, and traffic continues for the most part without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in popular usage, refers to overland journeys to see the marvelous wild animals of Africa, particularly in the savanna.
What animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to vehicles, and standard equipment will allow a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "safari trekking", or simply "walking") consists of excursions, lasting a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you had booked the flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies are changing, but by the end of March most Covid-related cancellation policies don't reach until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is thought that most event tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they are not in the room.
If the iron isn't available, or if you don't feel like putting on ironed socks, then you can try with the hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to iron the fabric too much (because it can shrink, or in extreme cases even burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places the water boils enough in a minute, in other places it needs several minutes.
The filters change in power, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying sealed bottled water from a trusted brand.
Travelers may encounter parasites that they are not familiar with in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force, are not usually defined as parasites.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods without taxes and excise duties in specific places.
Travelers going directly to countries with heavy taxation can save a significant amount of money, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the toughest driving conditions of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated and remote terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, use your common sense: they are full of steep hills, narrow stretches, and tight curves.
The speed limits are much lower than the sections before and after - commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and respecting them strictly is more important than elsewhere.
However, it's curious how the cell phone service is stronger here than in many other sections of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rather substantial and diverse, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apples baked into the dough throughout the year, and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many German bakery products contain almonds, hazelnuts, and also other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but filling pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of Northern India or Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and other regions on the coast of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term that consists of a great variety of regional cuisines throughout the nation.
However, used without further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originating from the center and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine has a variety of dishes seasoned in a simple way, the dominant flavors that Javanese people like are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet that stick out on either side of the saddle.
They provided great stability for horseback riding, but they could be concerning for safety due to the possibility that the rider's feet would get stuck inside.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot stuck in the stirrup, they could be dragged by the horse if it runs away. To decrease this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders put on boots with a heel and a smooth, tight sole.
Later, some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup to come loose if pulled backwards by a rider who is about to fall.
The Cochamo Valley - the main destination for climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cracks.
We have seen breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly opening new routes through its walls of endless potential.
Alpine sports on snow, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings that show skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste, ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It's linked to alpine style ski touring or climbing, but usually it doesn't need to be done, and these two are done on steep terrain with the need for harder skis and boots.
Think of the ski course as if it were a similar trekking route.
In good condition you will manage to cover greater distances than walking - but only rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is quite small but with many independent countries. In normal situations, traveling through several countries would mean applying for visas and having passport checks many times.
However, the Schengen area functions as if it were a single country.
As long as you stay within this area, in general you can cross the borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa you don't have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member state, therefore it saves time, money and paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition for when industrial objects are defined as antiques. Some tax agencies define as antiques those objects that are more than 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handcrafted products can be considered antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of sustenance among the Sami, and the culture around trade is also important for many other professions.
Always by tradition, however, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but they lived by fishing, hunting and the like, and kept reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern sectors. Tourism is an important income source in Sápmi, the area of the Sami.
Even though widely used, particularly among my relatives, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with stereotypes and false perceptions about Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You could also consider consulting the advice of governments different from yours, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might find themselves in different situations than those of Europeans or Arabs.
I only need a short description of the political situation of a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, or too simplified compared to the more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for all dangerous weather phenomena with the capacity to cause damage, significant social disruption, or human death.
Bad weather can happen everywhere in the world, and there are several varieties depending on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, storms, excessive rain, and fires are all forms and consequences of severe weather, like thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal meteorological phenomena of severe weather include blizzards, snowstorms, hailstorms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all the weather-related risks affecting their area, as these could impact their travel plans.
All those who plan a visit to a country that can be considered a war zone should obtain professional training.
It is likely that searching the internet for "courses on hostile environments" will provide the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address in more detail all the issues that have been discussed here, usually with practical experience.
A course in general is 2-5 days long and includes simulations, a lot of first aid, and sometimes even weapons training.
Books and journals that deal with surviving in the wilderness are common, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers who plan to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents to return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to correspond to a desired name and gender may vary.
Even the willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is highly variable.
Security checks and searches have also become much more intrusive in the era following September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who need to undergo surgery should not have to expect to go through security checks without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rip currents are the flow that returns back from the waves that break offshore, often on reefs or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in the deeper sections, and there a rapid current could form towards the deep waters.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion in the attempt to swim backwards against the current, which could be impossible.
Once you've finished dealing with the current, swimming back isn't any more difficult than usual.
First try to go where they can't catch you yet, or, depending on your abilities or if you've been seen, you might want to wait for reinforcements.
The shock of returning home arrives sooner than the time it takes to adapt to a new culture (the honeymoon phase is shorter). You feel worse and it takes longer to pass.
Travelers who have no problem adapting to a new culture often struggle to return to their own culture.
If you return home after living abroad, you get used to that new culture and you lose some habits of the culture of your home country.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were perhaps calm and good at putting up with things. They knew that travelers need to adapt when they arrive in a new country.
It may be that people don't know that travelers returning home need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the silence before the show begins.
Usually you could always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a book of fables.
The Sphinx acts as a background and tells a long story.
The scenes being shown are of pyramids, and the various pyramids are being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of bases, with 16 active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Beyond lie Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the submerged caldera of a still-active volcano provides a beautiful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge with the high plateau, and then emerge again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northernmost part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak of 4,892 meters at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without a phone signal, a satellite phone could be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a cell phone because you have to be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by expeditions, including pleasure boats, and missions that need remote voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about the connection to this service.
A increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among those who drop out of school, as it allows them to take a year off before university without ruining their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a one-year course abroad can actually increase your chances of moving on to higher education when you return to your country.
There's usually a registration fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a beautiful destination if you like going by boat. The "land of a thousand lakes" has even more than a thousand islands in its lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In the archipelago and on the lake, you don't necessarily need to steer a yacht.
Even though the islands off the coast and the biggest lakes are deep enough for yachts of all sizes, smaller boats or even a kayak give you the chance to enjoy a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and there is one boat for every seven people.
It exists in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it's a pretty unique thing (for example, in the Netherlands there's one for every forty people).
The majority of characteristic cruises on the Baltic Sea have a long stay in Saint Petersburg, in Russia.
It means that you can visit the historical city for a couple of full days while returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only disembark with the ship's excursions you don't need a separate visa (since 2009).
This cruise doesn't include Berlin in Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not on the sea and a visit to this city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and the bias towards other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during the flight can help overcome a fear that is based on what is unknown or on the perceived lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver goods quickly. Often, time is very important with company documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On certain routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and for smaller companies there was a problem.
If they shipped the goods by air, on some route they could have put some days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to make it faster was to ship it as registered luggage. Airline regulations don't allow shipping luggage without a passenger, and that's where you came in.
If you want to travel in first class, you have to take out the money (or it's even better if your company pays the money for you).
The price is very expensive for business class and usually it's up to four times the price of a normal ticket or even up to eleven times the price if you want to buy first class.
It's practically useless to look for discounts to buy first class or business class tickets if you have to fly from country A to country B without stopping.
Airline companies know well that there are people willing to spend money to travel comfortably and quickly. Therefore, they charge a lot.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also used a lot.
Moldavia is a republic with many ethnicities that has suffered from conflicts related to ethnicity.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member states of the United Nations.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
In Moldova, the main religion is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, it is the second port after Istanbul and has a very good transport interchange.
Once an ancient city of Smyrna, today it is a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center, located inside a very large bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centers are filled with traditional roofs with red tiles, the 18th-century market, the ancient mosques and churches, even if the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the island of Eysturoy nearby and has a rare octagonal church.
In the cemetery, on some tombs there are interesting marble dove sculptures.
It's worth walking slowly through the curious little village.
To the north and quickly reached is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, which had become famous for foreigners after Lord Byron had spoken of its beauties with enthusiasm.
The Scotturb Bus 403 always travels to Sintra, and it stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always head north and visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a site famous throughout the world for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that in practice you are visiting a mass grave site and also a site that for a large portion of the world's population has an importance that is almost immeasurable.
There are still many men and women alive who have been miraculously saved, and many others with loved ones who have been killed or worked to death, Jews or non-Jews in the same way.
Please treat this site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
I ruin mine by drawing or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, the majority of signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used on public transport and other services.
The regular subway announcements are still made only in Catalan, but the unscheduled interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being very self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even if it's often just a wrong belief, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave well, to appear to be someone who is "well-bred" (well brought up). It will greatly facilitate getting around.
The surly attitude of the children will go away quickly if you show good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has an abundance of forests, mainly beech, pine, and fir, and has a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a great variety of plant communities, thanks to its wealth of microclimates, different terrains, and diverse levels of altitude.
The area also hosts a rather large variety of animal species and birds.
Here you can find rare animals like the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the black grouse, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach the knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with strong colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that reach the knees.
You can also borrow this at the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes aren't washed after every use, so you might not feel very comfortable with these gowns. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple and popular dish, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available condiment such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, together with the word "Sie" to give the formal "you", always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is an important way to differentiate a certain verb from the objects.
It is likely that it also makes the language easier, even if the writing is rather difficult due to the need to figure out if a verb or an adjective are being used in a substantivized form.
In Italian, the pronunciation is rather easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to which you need to pay attention are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel immediately following.
Also, make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means cart.
Persian has a grammar that is quite easy and for the most part regular.
So, reading this grammar manual would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a bit of Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that there's no need to study it separately.
Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are usually old and remain as museums or places of education.
When their peak was, light pollution wasn't the kind of problem it is today, often they were in cities or campuses, quickly reached compared to those built in modern times.
Modern research telescopes are structured quite large in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept arrived from China, where plum blossoms were the favorite flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted only by the emperor for himself and for other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants have a better appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a garden organized in a formal way, calling someone an "exemplar" will get you kicked out, no questions asked.
Generally, Singapore is a pretty safe place to live and it's also quite easy to get around, and you can buy almost everything after you arrive.
But since it's located in the "humid tropics", just a few degrees north of the Equator, you'll have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less often).
There's also a bus that goes north towards Hebron, the traditional burial site of biblical patriarchs such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're planning to take goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.
Navigable waterways can be a good theme around which to organize a vacation.
For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise in the interesting cities on the Danube, or go boating along the Erie Canal.
I also defined routes for popular hikes and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the anniversary of Jesus.
Many traditions linked to the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians all over the world.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake in a viewpoint to watch the sunrise.
It is clear that there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
Traditional churches often host a Paschal vigil on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregations that often begin to celebrate when it is midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands arrived by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, mammals were not able to make the journey, so the first animal to graze in the Galapagos was the giant tortoise.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, they have brought several mammals, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you were to visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you would experience the polar night, which means that the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
They offered a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, if the sky is dark more or less all day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
The dress code is normal work attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental, and it gives importance to the group effort rather than praising individual results.
Employees often have to obtain approval from their superiors for every decision they make, and they have to obey their superiors' instructions without asking questions.
