It not only confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details such as color and three-dimensional arrangement, which fossils usually cannot provide.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers are chestnut-brown on the upper part and light or carotenoid-tinged on the underside.
This discovery sheds light on the origin of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers believe the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The feather's structure suggests it was used for temperature regulation or display, rather than flight. Researchers noted that even if it is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the sample indicates the presence of fully formed feathers.
Although this is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, researchers say the sample indicates an adult's fringe, not a baby's.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing 2 police officers and injuring more than twenty people.
The Governor's office informed that 19 of the injured are police officers.
Police said they suspect that Daesh (ISIS), who is accused of being responsible for the attack, is a terrorist.
They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in a star cluster revolves around their light and rotation, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to calculate the Rossby number of a star related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the lower the efficiency of stars in driving magnetic evolution.

The work done was purely theoretical, but the program was written to be executed according to the observations made in the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The result the team investigated is caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the Triangulum Galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon's attraction to Earth causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that dark matter also affects other dark matter, just like regular matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter surrounding a galaxy exists in a halo-like structure around the galaxy and is composed of numerous small particles.

Dr. Tony Mol discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, a South African region.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is very distressing and frightening because the mortality rate is very high.
Dr. Mole believes that some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, and that at least two of them were healthcare workers at the hospital.
Within a year, a single infected person could spread the disease to 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the percentage of people with XDR-TB among all people with tuberculosis still seems low; for example, in South Africa, 6,000 out of 330,000 people were infected at any particular moment.

During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surfaces, and at night, they are slightly warmer.
"Their thermal behavior isn't as robust as large caves on Earth that often maintain a stable temperature, but it's consistent because these are deep holes in the ground," said Glens Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center in Flagstaff, Arizona, and Northern Arizona University.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters stand alone in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet showing their preferred candidate into an envelope.
Once the officials verify the voter's identification, he deposits the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent, allowing voters and observers to clearly see and monitor that no envelopes are inside at the start of the polling and that only properly counted and authorized voters have envelopes added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of this process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision, following the prescribed procedures.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekojo is on trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of his son.
She is in custody as the charges and trial are ongoing, but all eyewitness testimonies may be tainted as her picture has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice anywhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and courts have observed that publishing photographs is potentially prejudicial.
"Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, notes, "When journalists publish photos of those accused of crimes, they are treading a dangerous path.""
The Crown Office, which has full responsibility for the prosecution, has made it clear to journalists that it will not make any comment until the chargesheet is filed.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute and wishes to base it on the Palestinian borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics included the future status of Jerusalem, a holy site for both countries, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a military presence in the valley for ten years after signing the agreement, but the PA only agrees to allow such a presence for five years.
In the associated pest control trial, rangers need to closely monitor the shooters, as the trial has been observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were appointed in the talent identification program of the Sporting Shooters Association, with the participation of NPWDS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Acting Director Park Conservation and Heritage NPWS, Mick O'Flynn, the 4 shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
As part of the steps to move the country towards new elections, the President had recommended the resignation of the former CEC to the Commission last month.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The failure to conduct elections, which were due in 2011 and remain outstanding, has fueled violent protests at times.
Approximately 60 incidents of overheating and misuse of iPods have been reported, resulting in 6 fires and minor burns to 4 people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, MEITY reported that Apple had reported 34 incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded to Apple regarding the postponed report, stating, "It is truly regrettable."
The Mariana earthquake was felt at 07:19 a.m. local time (Friday 09:19 p.m. GMT).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office has reported that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has announced that there are no tsunami warnings in effect.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza turned his M16 rifle on the tourists.
Numerous hostages were rescued, and it has been confirmed so far that six people have died.
The first six hostages, including adults and children, were released, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers arrived at the location of an elderly woman who needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began his career at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he began to investigate premature birth in his spare time.
His research proved that if a hormone is administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy the Dreamer said, "Luna was an extremely important queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the 2 moons. A unique, powerful woman as captivating as she was."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna is weird like me...maybe a little more...love her and will definitely miss her...hope she's in a good place."
Of the 1400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia would become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II wants to be the last monarch of Australia.
After the election, 29 percent of participants believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical fitness is in doubt, according to his complaint.
Even though he was in pain, he couldn't take medication because he was banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
At the beginning of February, numerous people using different hardware and software confirmed the discovery and made the announcement on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source that brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that could evolve into proteins capable of supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth came to be, because comets collided with Earth a very long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described the rumors as "political banter and idiocy".
It is speculated that he will contest for the post of President in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the FAA that will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-radar-based technology, allowing air traffic controls to determine the position of aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transportation arrangements, no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and car parking or park and ride facilities will not be available at the grounds.
The lack of transportation facilities raised concerns about whether the teams would have to play without fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday describes the emergence of a new lineage of birds in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations due to interbreeding between the Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, even though it was believed that this process would take longer.
Gold can be brought into any form. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires that can be twisted and crimped. It can also be flattened and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and can adhere to other metals. It can be made very thin, and it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms contain 1 proton and 1 electron).
Whisk the dry ingredients together, then, with clean, damp hands, squeeze and form them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which is interesting and will create a kind of peeling.
In every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, there were flush toilets with a modern drainage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and in the houses of Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses used jointly by men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call and instantly relays it downwards.
The satellite was launched into space on a rocket. Scientists use telescopes for space observation because the Earth's atmosphere affects light and our vision.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel transformed the world in unique ways. The greatest thing the wheel gave us is easy and fast transportation.
It brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
They have a number of medium-sized cats under them that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to blackbuck and deer.
Finally, there were many kittens there (including pets) that preyed on things like insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the common understanding of "Niche," assigning each cat a specific job to prevent competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The Pride 1-3 was made up of adult men affiliated with it, along with about thirty women and children.
Being a large family comprised of sisters and daughters, the women are closely connected to each other.
The lion's pride operates similarly to packs of wolves or dogs. In behavior, the animals are remarkably similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are highly deadly to their prey.
A perfect athlete, a tiger can climb heights, swim (although not very well), leap great distances, and drag things with five times the strength of a strong person.
Like lions, leopards, and tigers, panthers also belong to the same group (genus Panthera). Only these 4 felines have the ability to roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's full, booming roar, but more like a growling, screaming phrase.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If possible, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and locate prey animals, essentially sniffing out where they are.
Because they have excellent night vision, they can see very well and move very quickly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small number) becomes separated from the main group they belonged to (if they move to a mountain range, a riverbank, or an island from which it is not easy to return), they often end up in a very different environment from the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different rivals. Therefore, the new generation needs different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger opponent than previously required.
The actual population has not changed at all, and they still require the same accommodations as before.
As the new generation gradually adapts to their new environment, they increasingly begin to look down upon other populations.
Gradually, after thousands or millions of years, the two groups will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very prominent transformation.
Plants produce oxygen for humans to breathe and also absorb the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (i.e., exhale).
Plants create their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from trees, and we make clothes from trees. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Animals cannot survive without forests.
Mosasaurs were the most powerful creatures of that time, so they feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long mouth was lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and there was another set on the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that caught its eye could escape.
We are not sure, but it had a forked tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and reptiles, and perhaps, it could even be a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex couldn't stand against it.
The majority of the Romans' diet might be familiar to us, but they also had strange or unusual food habits, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat their meals sitting on chairs, the rich are interested in feasts, where they eat leaning to the sides.
Later Roman cuisine, in the centuries that followed, did not include foods that came from America or Asia to Europe.
For example, they did not have grains, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa. The ancient Romans never tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, considering it the primary temple.
People offer sacrifices to the gods. Priests also try to fulfill the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctum accessible only to priests.
Pyramid-shaped towers, sometimes called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was the god's special sanctuary.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house wasn't that important.
Most of Hebrew family life takes place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard; the stores were just counters opening onto the street. The houses were built using stone.
The Canaan region did not have large forests, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was scattered here and there. Norse mythology says that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of countries like Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might sometimes feel that a treasure map is written behind the Declaration of Independence.
Nevertheless, that's not true. Even though something was written on the back of that document, it wasn't a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4th July 1776". This phrase appears upside down at the very bottom of the document.
Although no one knows who wrote it, this large parchment document (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) is known to have been rolled up for storage at the beginning.
Therefore, the notation likely simply adds a label.
Although the D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, the south was still not free.
"Vichy" was ruled by the French. In 1940, they reached a consensus with the Germans and these were the French people who worked with them instead of fighting against the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France, an invasion known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just 2 weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France from Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live in a society and work together.
The term "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis," meaning "civil," and is related to the Latin term "civis," which means "citizen." Furthermore, "civitas" means "city-state," which in a way also defines the multitude of society.
City-states preceded nations. A civilization signifies the transmission of knowledge across generations, enduring cultural footprints, and appropriate propagation.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
In the midst of the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation—with Congress as its sole component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and furthermore, lacking a national executive or judiciary, it was often dependent on state authorities, who were frequently uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
It did not have the authority to invalidate tariffs and tax laws between states.
Unanimous consent of all states was required to amend the instrument, but the states regarded the central government with utter disregard, and their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team is not only, like the German national team, one of the two most successful teams in the world, but also the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing are some of the popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians often compete in them in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan comprises 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island nation in the world.
Because Japan consists of a group/complex of islands, Japan is called an "archipelago" according to the geographical criterion.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. They ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three main structures known as the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a sense of how they actually looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm. This was a popular film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, we can say that the absolute ratio of this format (when divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS family formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, a simple guideline for creating dynamism in an image while maintaining a sense of order, is one of the most misused and often ridiculed compositional techniques.
The most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersections of lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was subjected to scrutiny.
For approximately over a thousand years, Christianity has stood together with European states, transcending language and customs.
It is a pervasive force that affects everyone, from the king to the commoner.
A key Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is the purpose of the church's treasury.
For thousands of years, this church's supreme authority has been with Rome, and this centralization of power and money has prompted many to question whether these doctrines are correct.
Hostilities broke out, and Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
Nevertheless, this stratagem has proven effective by cutting off crucial military and civilian supplies, even though this embargo violates generally accepted international law, codified through numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters, preventing ships from entering all parts of the sea, even endangering neutral vessels.
Germany expected a similar reaction to their unrestricted submarine warfare, as this tactic received a limited response.
In the 1920s, the majority of citizens in most countries desired peace and isolation.
Having recognized the horror and brutality of the war during World War I, countries were interested in preventing such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with a recommendation letter for 4 cents in his name, a book of poems, Charles Batchelor (manager of his former job), and Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique system for marking different periods of time; each phase was a distinct dynasty, representing the reign of a particular family or power in China.
There was an unstable period of provinces divided among various dynasties. One of the most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, intense battles took place among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people fighting and dying for the highest position in the priceless palace of Xi'an.
The adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to democracy, nationalism, and the idea that the country belongs to the people and not the ruler were among the numerous social and political impacts present there.
After the revolution, all male applicants were given access to jobs, allowing everyone with the ambition to succeed to achieve victory.
Since military ranking is now based on merit rather than class, it also applies to the army.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolutionary activities.
Prophet Muhammad's concern was with matters beyond this worldly life. He would regularly go to a cave known as "Hira" on the "Noor" (light) mountain for meditation.
The cave itself, having survived the passage of time, offers a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
This cave, located at the summit of a mountain in the northern part of Mecca, stands completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if one knows it exists, finding it is not easy. Once trapped inside the cave, you will be isolated.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky and the many mountains surrounding it. From inside the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, is one of the many large pyramid structures built as a tribute to the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian valley is a site with numerous pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The largest pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-willa" symbol looks like a V, and the "down-willa" symbol looks like a hook or a square with its bottom part missing.
Up bow means you push the bow starting from the tip, and down bow means you pull the bow starting from the frog (the part of the bow you hold with your hand).
An up-bow typically creates a softer sound, while a down-bow creates a stronger and more assertive sound.
Feel free to lightly mark your part with a pencil, but remember that there are printed bowing indications for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forcibly brought back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
Amidst a mob shouting and threatening the King and Queen, they returned to Paris in a carriage.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the car windows.
At one point, a member of the crowd mentioned the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the Queen.
The war expenses incurred by US imperialism in conquering the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes through Wall Street banking houses to the U.S. colonial administration, a large portion of which was for managing expenses and also for interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government.
Certainly, the fundamental achievement of US imperialism is the enormous profits gained by exploiting the Filipino people for a long time.
To understand the Templars, one must certainly understand the context of its creation and the circumstances that prompted it.
This period in which these events occurred is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a range of ideas, from technology-push or technological imperative, to the stricter sense that human destiny is determined by scientific laws and their manifestation in technology, with an inherent logic associated with those laws.
Technological determinism generally shares two ideas: that the development of technology is independent of cultural and political influences, and that technology is instead intrinsic to society and generally prescriptive.
For example, one might say that the development of roads is essential for motor cars.
Nevertheless, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
The increasing number of car owners leads to more accidents on the roads, which in turn drives the discovery of new technologies in healthcare to repair the damage to injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant component of the cultural tradition it received from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic Movement, landscapes influenced individuals, and over time, customs and cultures associated with those landscapes emerged, aligning with the community's place, making them superior to arbitrarily imposed rules.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
The decline in its prestige in the twelfth century was mainly due to the Crusaders returning gifts like silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets valued more than they offered.
It was during this time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries, and also in the 14th century.
The attire was initially heavily influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
Nevertheless, due to slow communication methods, Westerners will lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is simple and often organic, and in this system, intercropping or other relatively simple techniques are coordinated with conserved seeds in environmental protection areas to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together like-minded people who feel overlooked by mainstream societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of various factors.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership through distinctive and symbolic means, including fashion, gestures, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to identify the unfortunate cases of children who, while growing up, were not socialized by adults and went through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some uncontrollable children are confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because parents reject the child's intellectual or physical disability.
The children must have experienced severe abuse and trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some allege that they were raised as pets; others say they were living in the wild on their own.
Feral children raised and nurtured by animals other than humans exhibit the behaviors of the animal that cared for them (within physical limits). They show fear of humans and tend to stay away from them.
While project-based learning makes studying easier and more interesting, grading it in levels is a step too far.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support system for individuals undergoing new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both imaginary and real; to put it another way, a teacher is as much a scaffold as the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized within the software and are intended to question, prompt, and explain procedures that might be challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care due to a long list of various reasons ranging from neglect and misappropriation to humiliation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment devoid of nourishment, care, and education, but it happens.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is expected to provide all necessary amenities that they previously had, that are not available at home.
The internet integrates elements of social and personal communication.
The distinct features of the internet have led to more levels of usage and a satisfying approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are often cited as key motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Ayeh and McCord (1998), while investigating viewers' responses to websites, identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as newly motivating factors.
The use of video recording led to key findings in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that if microexpressions are interpreted correctly, one can tell if another person is lying.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out how people with brain damage who cannot understand speech are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He suggests that animals like domestic dogs may also possess such abilities to interpret human behavior.
Twentieth-century research has demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variations: recessive and dominant.
Mutation creates new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of apparent variation.
Segregation and recombination, this variation between the two types keeps shifting in every generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for an ape with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failing to do so has serious consequences such as growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Proteins available in plant sources like leaves and legumes are the easiest to obtain, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest if not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide plenty of protein containing essential amino acids.
Considering everything, it's not surprising if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep time and going back to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
Using a relatively quiet alarm clock, you can be easily brought to a conscious state without fully waking up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (such as water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, forcing a person to wake up to urinate.
The degree of a person's inner peace is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
When tension decreases, passion for life becomes more positive. Every individual has the ability to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain the light of knowledge. A possible consequence of standing in the path of this goal is that we may succumb to our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been expanded through the Mahayana path of compassion and a wealth of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces everyone.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yogic practices, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the central focus of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, energy sources are purified, chakras are activated, and wisdom consciousness is created.
Germany being a common enemy in World War II led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. As the war ended, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures turned the countries hostile.
It has been 2 years since the war ended, former allies are now enemies, and the Cold War has begun.
This will last for the next 40 years. The war will be waged through shadow armies in war zones from Africa to Asia, and in many other places like Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Polish resistance had collapsed. The only hope was to retreat through the Romanian Bridgehead and reorganize.
Nevertheless, projects like the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements became almost obsolete overnight when the Soviet Union, violating the Treaty of Riga and invading Poland's eastern territories, entered 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Ships are the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The navy's job is to interfere with the enemy's ability to move people and goods, while also ensuring your country maintains its ability to move its own people and goods, traditionally.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic phase of World War II, where Americans tried to transport people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy was mainly trying to disrupt this traffic using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered Britain because they would have had the rest of Europe in their grasp.
It is believed that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to care for them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Goats were raised as herds that roamed the hills or other pasturelands. These were often herded by young shepherds, children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known shepherds. These methods of livestock rearing are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England in the sixteenth century.
Although wagonways consisted of wooden planks laid parallel, they allowed horses to pull larger loads and achieve greater speeds, in addition to being slightly less rough than the roads of the day.
Cross ties were previously used to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually recognized that they would be more effective if there was a steel plate on top of the tracks.
This has become a common occurrence, but it is causing more wear and tear on the thick wheels of these iron wagons.
Gradually, thick wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron came into existence.
The earliest known mode of transportation was walking, and with the rise of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man"), humans began walking upright around two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright consistently.
While Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago, bipedal specializations are seen in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years.
We can start living more harmoniously with the environment, join environmental movements, and work to reduce future hardships to some extent.
This is like treating the symptoms in many cases. But, if we need more than just a temporary fix, we need to find the root cause of the problems, and we need to neutralize them.
It is clear that the world has changed dramatically due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity. Problems have also increased significantly due to the growing population and the excessive lifestyle of mankind.
Following Congress's approval on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and they are now called "Dunlap Broadsides".
John Nixon conducted the first public reading of the Declaration at Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it before his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlop broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript is not available.
Many scientists who study fossils today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Many do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are still many things about birds that make them seem like dinosaurs.
They have clawed and scaled feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their 2 hind legs like T-Rex.
All computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information coded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - when used in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are commonly seen, making prompt diagnosis difficult.
Inside, signs of poisoning could include an open container of medicine or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the substance involved.
Entomologists formally use the term "bug" to refer to this group of insects.
The term originated from the old familiarity with bedbugs, insects that are adapted to live by depending on humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are parasites, adapted to live in nests or their place of origin.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or the child's.
If this couple wishes, they can prepare an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish all their rights, allowing another couple to become the child's guardians.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through a scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
Nevertheless, this is not all; experimentation, where experimentation is a way to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations, also drives scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, gained acceptance.
Due to a lack of knowledge regarding Greek heritage, the Western world disconnected itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many experts have observed that the rhythm and behavior of physiology often significantly depend on inherent frequencies and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, which are not merely responses to external periodic cues.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can function independently for a period of time, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the key suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, one by labeling the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the other by labeling the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the nature of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts visitors who are drawn to the enjoyment of natural beauty, encompassing plants and wildlife.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems are examples of on-site activities.
Visiting orangutans in Borneo to study them and take their photos is an example.
Every morning, people leave in cars from small towns to their workplaces, passing those travelling to work in the opposite direction, back to where they started.
This dynamic transport shuttle, which is based on private cars, connects and supports everyone in some way.
Science now suggests that the carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is a stakeholder in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you won't hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they maintain with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because a driver's behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave rationally within a stable range; therefore, the traffic flow has a reasonable uniformity and can be represented almost mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections facilitate the planning, designing, and implementation of road infrastructure projects.
Insects were the first creatures to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape predators more easily and to find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the special ability to fold their wings neatly against their body.
This gives it a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus had said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
While some believed his claim that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars), revolved around the Earth was correct, many others did not.
This seems logical, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving to itself, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the largest river by volume. It carries about 8 times more water than the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the earth into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction using stone continued until the end of the old kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence.
The people of the New Kingdom in ancient Egypt marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, some of which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, but Italian is the language used by most people working in the country.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper in ancient times; these could all be found in their native form in nature and were relatively easy to mine using rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorizes that everything is made up of 4 elements, or a combination of one or more of them: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is just like the four states of matter (in the same order); solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, and he has also theorized that they will become new objects that we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold as well.
You can also have alloys that include non-metallic elements like carbon in small amounts.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are unbelievably small; trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many when it was available.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to lower standards and uses.
Now that people type messages on computer screens, sharpeners are never needed.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works by releasing energy from a nucleus with a large number of neutrons and protons.
It's like rolling a heavy pushcart uphill. The nucleus splits again, releasing some energy in the process.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they will break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick, and up to 100 kilometers thick at its lateral edges.
It is thin below Maria and thick in the highlands.
Because the surface was thin, there may be more maria nearby. It was easy for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what causes people to be satisfied or motivated.
These principles suggest that only those with certain needs or desires internalize them and reach adulthood.
These theories suggest what motivates some people to do certain things and what aspects of their environment influence them to do or not do something.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories of motivation.
Generally speaking, two behavioral patterns are likely to emerge when managers have to lead their former friends. One of them is trying to remain "one of them".
Such a manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct performance reviews, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
Secondly, a person becomes an unidentifiable entity and believes that they should change everything the team is doing and make it all their own.
Above all, the captain is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes a rift between the team captain and the players.
The current teams had the same excellence as the traditional teams, but there were also some subtle differences.
Often, virtual team members act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Their teams meet in different time zones, which their local management doesn't understand, and as a result, they often had more autonomy than traditional team members.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a distinctive characteristic of a virtual team.
"The 'Invisible Team' is the management team where each member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization be interested in going through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and skill can be transformed when all available resources across an organization's operational departments are used effectively.
As a result, the operation of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle may lead to a new, innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership needs to create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve high performance.
In the quest for understanding consciousness, a theoretical approach finds explicit evidence in neurobiological data, thereby narrowing the scope of the research field and making it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies makes it possible to see and explore brain structures and functions never seen before.
This provides a wealth of information and resources for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI might seem like science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with a machine's behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research includes building machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to answer customer inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things come under different systems, and they focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, much like how they were previously implemented in numerous home computer and video game software applications.
Study tours are an important part of any education. Teachers often prefer to take students to places where bus travel is not feasible.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips, allowing students to view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or marvel at beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, and each year the website is rebuilt, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start writing on their blogs using sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger started improving their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to gain more practical knowledge about the world around them." Having to satisfy the interests of the audience inspires students to be resourceful and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond a typical school day.
"The appropriate use of blogs empowers students to become more analytical and critical; by actively engaging with internet tools, students can define their positions within the context of others' articles and develop their own perspectives on each argument (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa, Canada's attractive, bilingual capital, boasts a wealth of attractions and is home to a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
If you go south, you can enjoy Niagara Falls, and if you go north, you can enjoy the natural beauty of Muskoka and other regions.
Ontario is highlighted as a Canadian province that outsiders consider unable to do without these things and others.
Large areas are very sparsely populated in the north. Some are uninhabited deserts.
Here's how the Malayalam sentence translates to English: The population comparison that surprises many is this: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and, in terms of wildlife, practically its own continent.
Most of the small islands are either independent countries or associated with France, and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also spread Islam to many regions. This reached Comoros and Mayotte on a large scale.
With the discovery of the Cape route to India from Europe by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, European influence and colonization began in the 15th century.
The Sahel borders the north of this region, and the Atlantic Ocean borders the south and west.
Women: It is best for all female travelers to say they are married, regardless of whether they actually are or not.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to incidents they perceive as harassment, and that things like following and holding hands are not uncommon.
Be firm in rejecting men, don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or otherwise, do not justify it!).
In the 10th century BCE, Berber fishermen founded the modern city of Casablanca, which was subsequently used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
Following the earthquake of 1755, the Portuguese destroyed it, only to abandon it, and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida, and Spanish merchants gave it the name Casablanca and established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina selling traditional Moroccan goods like Moroccan food dishes, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and toys, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east of the country near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the town center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma will be studied and attempts will be made to understand the problems prevailing in the North Kivu province.
This city is the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo volcano, as well as offering the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get to Goma. The typical (local) fare for this short distance is ~500 Congolese Francs.
Because it's difficult to reach, the term "Timbuktu" came to be used figuratively when referring to extraordinary and faraway lands.
Even though Thimphu is a poor city now, its reputation attracts tourists, and it also has an airport.
Due to the threat of desert sand, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites in 1990.
It was one of the key locations in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
This city is entirely different from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabian flavor than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while its southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
Spanning an area of 19,500 km2, this park is divided into 14 eco-zones to protect various wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, this park has daily conservation and entrance fees.
Purchasing a Wild Card, which grants access to some parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks, could be beneficial for someone.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main focus for many tourists.
The row of buildings that creates the Hong Kong skyline is called a shimmering bar chart, made visible by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, you need to leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land, including the northern shore.
This place was appropriated by British colonial rulers, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending approximately 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coastal regions of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans region has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of this forest area located in India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
The mangroves are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the very large forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Covering an area of 3,850 km2, Sundarbans has one-third of its area covered by water/swampy regions.
Declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1966, the Sundarbans is estimated to now have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, however, most, especially those heading east towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It's best to book tickets a few days in advance for inter-district buses, as they are often crowded.
Most districts had small Japanese coaster buses, which were comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient option for traveling to nearby places, especially to places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, having a length of 378 meters, and featuring two narrow pathways with a width of 3.50 meters.
The steep height under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in agriculture for their livelihood.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, and their means of survival were hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born from the clash between invading Spaniards and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated the colonization period, which lasted for about three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain its indigenous character and style.
Argentina has one of the best polo teams in the world, and also some excellent players.
The biggest match of the year is taking place this December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Check the Argentine Polo Association for news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to 1 British pound (GBP).
Money can be transferred from the only bank on the island, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West Store.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and often Stanley credit cards and United States Dollars are also accepted.
While credit cards may not be accepted on the islands in the border region, British and United States currency might be; check with the owners in advance to determine what payment method is acceptable.
It is impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before traveling there.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it experiences summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a temperate zone, and during the summer months, temperatures above +30 degrees Celsius are common.
Winter is enticingly cold: Temperatures will drop below freezing, but when wind and humidity combine, it will feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are visible to humans, wild animals are still wild animals, and you should not try to feed them or disturb them.
As per the instructions of the park authorities, a minimum distance of 100 yards/meters should be maintained from bears and wolves, and a distance of 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
Even though they may appear to be sleeping, almost all large animals like gaur, sambar deer, mouse deer, and bears are likely to attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year due to not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, aggressive, and dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, be aware that the scent can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking overly fragrant food, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and served as the official capital of Samoa from 1959 onwards.
It was at this port that the infamous naval standoff occurred in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
As part of the movement for independence, a peaceful meeting of the Mau movement was held in the city, and as a result, Paramount Chief Tapuwa Thamcese Leolofi III was assassinated.
With two harbors intertwined, Auckland boasts numerous beaches, the most popular of which are concentrated in three main areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the Northern Harbors District) are a vast stretch of coastline on the Pacific Ocean, extending from Davenport in the north to the south.
Most are sandy beaches with safe swimming conditions, and many offer shade from Casuarina trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitematā Harbour, within the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes busy family beaches with a good range of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number 1', which is not a mixed beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Mantra".
There are plenty of French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better bet.
The tap water in this area is completely safe to drink, but if you're worried, you won't have any trouble finding bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," a cappuccino is piled high with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are delicious.
Numerous trips are made to Reef throughout the year, and injuries due to these trips to Reef are rare.
Furthermore, seek advice from authorities, follow all instructions, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occurrences predominantly happen from October to April, north of 1770, near beaches and river mouths. They can occasionally be seen outside of this period as well.
There are sharks, however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks will swim away because they are afraid of humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the open ocean; the river estuaries north of Rockhampton are their primary habitat.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind because they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, however, it may be possible for you to book other accommodations like campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents commonly offer breakfast and arrange transportation to/from the airport, and sometimes offer packages that include flight and hotel accommodation.
They can hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather alternative documents (e.g., visa) for your intended destination.
Nevertheless, any changes or requests should be communicated through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of people who come to listen to the music festivals decide to camp on the spot, believing it is essential for the completeness of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event you are attending, you'll need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Even though the music on the main stages is over, remember that music will continue to play late into the night in some parts of the festival.
Some festivals have dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the northern Baltic during winter, check the cabin position, as those most affected may make terrifying noises when passing through the ice.
St. Petersburg cruises often include time to spend in the city, and visa requirements are generally waived for cruise passengers (check conditions).
Casinos mainly make many attempts to maximize time spent and to encourage guests to spend a lot of money. There usually aren't windows or clocks, and it can be very difficult to find the exit.
To keep the guests happy and to prevent them from leaving, there are special food, beverages, and entertainment offers for them.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered. However, drinking alcohol imposes prejudices, and all good gamblers are well aware of the importance of abstaining from alcohol.
Those driving in high latitudes or mountain passes should consider snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
Roads covered in ice and snow will have low friction; you won't be able to drive as you would on a tarred road.
In a blizzard, enough snow will fall in a very short time to trap you where you are.
Visibility is often reduced due to ice formation on vehicle windows or due to snow falling and hitting them.
On the other hand, snow and snowfall conditions are common in many countries, and transportation continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are one of the biggest tourist attractions in Africa, and a major draw for many visitors.
The popular term "safari" refers to an overland journey, especially through grasslands, to view the appealing African wildlife.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs will sometimes move aside, and you can get a good view of them through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") involves hiking that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some sports events will take place in other locations within Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted 2 Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
You might be in a difficult situation if you had booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not affect July 2020, the time the Olympics were supposed to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with a regular ticket costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Even if there is no one in the room, many hotels will loan you an iron and ironing board.
If you can't find an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as this can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are many ways to purify water. Some are more effective against certain types of threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute may be enough, while in other places, many minutes are required.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, buy your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Since they are unfamiliar even in their own regions, travelers may have to deal with insect pests.
Pests can contaminate food, cause discomfort, trigger reactions like allergies in severe cases, spread poison, and transmit infections.
Contagious diseases or dangerous animals that attack or kill people are not usually known as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods from certain places without taxes and duties.
Many of their writers have been greatly influenced by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert's news parody shows.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont creates some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, passing through isolated backwood terrains.
If you are not someone who regularly drives on rural roads, be careful: there will be inclines, slopes, narrow paths, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower compared to the preceding and subsequent sections, typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h). It is more important than anything else to adhere to them strictly.
The surprising thing is that the mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other areas along the route, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good. Bavarian pastries are diverse. They are similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, as apple is used year-round to make pastries, and cherries and plums announce their presence in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Exquisite cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small and tasty pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish prepared using medicinal herbs and spices, sometimes with the addition of meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of gravy.
In North India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine, with its 17,000 islands to choose from, is a syncretic term encompassing the diverse range of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if used without any further qualifiers, the term refers to food from the central and eastern parts of Java.
The hallmark of Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, is an array of exceptionally delicious dishes, with peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially their coconut sugar), and various spices forming the core flavor profile.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the cider.
They provide more stability to the rider, but there may be safety concerns as the rider's legs could get caught in them.
The rider was thrown from the horse but had one foot caught, so they could be dragged. To reduce this risk, many safety precautions can be taken.
Initially, most riders wear boots that have a heel, are delicate, somewhat tight-fitting, and have a sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall away from the side if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - known as the Yosemite of South America, is a unique climbing destination in Chile, with diverse large granite cliffs and steep rock faces.

Downhill snowsports, including skiing and snowboarding, where you slide down snow-covered terrain using skis or with a snowboard strapped to your feet, are popular sports.
Skiing is a major travel activity for many interested people who plan their entire vacation around it in a specific place, sometimes even known as "ski bums."
The concept of skiing is very old – cave paintings dating back to 5000 BC depict a person skiing!
As a sport, downhill skiing has existed since at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was started in Australia in 1861 by Norwegians.
Backpacking for skiing, also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related, but it doesn't usually involve alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering. The latter is done on steeper terrain and requires sturdier skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as being similar to a hiking route.
In good condition, you can travel further than you can walk - but you will rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing unless on prepared tracks and without a heavy backpack.
Although relatively small, Europe is a continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would require going through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
Nevertheless, the Schengen Zone, in this matter, functions like one country.
As long as you reside in this region, you can typically cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you don't need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a globally accepted definition of which manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax agencies consider items over 100 years old to be antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, such as age limits potentially being lower in regions like North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts are often defined as artifacts, even if they are more innovative than mass-produced similar products.
Reindeer herding is a major source of income among the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for those in other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding. Instead, they relied on fishing, hunting, and the like for their livelihood, mainly using reindeer for hauling loads.
Today, many Sami work in modern trades. Tourism is a major source of income for the Sami region.
"Although widely used, especially among non-Romanians, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romanian people."
If the country you are planning to visit is subject to a travel advisory, it will affect your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
You may also wish to seek advice from other governments, but such advice is tailored for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are just a summary of the political situation of a country.
The presented observations are general, very simple, and often careless when compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for a dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world. There are different types depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are formed, while lightning, storms, waterspouts, and cyclones are the result of severe weather.
Localized and evolving severe weather events such as blizzards, snowfall, ice storms, and dust storms.
We strongly urge travelers to be aware of the severe weather conditions in the places they intend to visit, as this can affect their travel plans.

Books and magazines dealing with subjects of surviving the wilderness are common, but publications referencing war zones are rare.
Passengers planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have sufficient documentation for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to provide documents that are gender-neutral (X), or conformed to a preferred name or a varied gender identity.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents varies.
Security checks at checkpoints have become much stricter since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners before surgery without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are flows of water that often occur on beaches, where waves crash against rocky outcrops or similar structures in the sea and bounce back.
Due to the underwater topology, backflow is concentrated mostly in the deeper areas. A rapid flow into deep water can form from there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion when attempting to swim against the waves, which can be an impossible task.
Once out of the flood, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try aiming for somewhere they won't catch you again. Alternatively, you might prefer to wait for rescue, depending on your abilities and whether you think they've been watching you.
Re-entry shock happens faster than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter there). It can also be longer lasting and more intense.
Travelers who have embraced a new culture and enjoyed a comfortable period may find it somewhat difficult to readjust to their native culture.
Having lived abroad and returning to your homeland, you will have adapted to a new culture while also losing some habits from your original culture.
When you are traveling abroad for the first time, understand that newcomers to the country need to adjust, and the locals will generally be tolerant and understanding.
People might not always think that patience and understanding are essential for travelers returning home.
One of the most interesting things in the children's section is the pyramid sound and light.
You can see the pyramids in the dark. You can see them in silence before the show begins.

The highest mountains of Antarctica, namely the Vinson Massif and Mount Vinson (4892 meters high), are located in the northern part, or rather in the Sentinel Range.
In remote locations with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally isn't a replacement for a mobile phone because you often have to go outside to establish contact with a satellite when making a call.
This service is regularly used for expeditions, including those involving pleasure craft and other remote shipping, as well as for remote data and voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information regarding connecting to this service.
A typical choice for a trip and learning experience for those planning a year-long break.
This is popular among school leavers, allowing them to spend a year before university without affecting their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of transitioning to higher education in your home country.

Finland is a great place for boating. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes", there are thousands of islands in the lakes and the sea.
In islands and lakes, you don't need a boat.
While the coastal archipelago and largest lakes are sufficient for any boat, even small boats or a kayak offer a unique experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with roughly one boat for every seven or eight people.
Alongside this, Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand arrive, but if it's the opposite, it's very unique (for example, in the Netherlands, this figure ranges from 1 to 40).
Most Baltic cruises tend to have extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
On your way back, you can spend two full days exploring that historic city and sleep on the ship at night.
If you are only taking a pleasure trip to the coast by travelling on the deck of a ship, you do not need a separate visa (as per 2009).
Some cruise brochures highlight Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a city visit is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and in all circumstances, especially for those who have never traveled by plane before or who have had a previous unpleasant experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of in this: it varies from person to person like personal fears or dislikes.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies receive deserved payments because they deliver goods quickly. Time is often very important for business documents, merchandise, and spare parts needed urgently for repairs.
Large companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but there was a problem for many other routes and smaller establishments.
If they ship goods via air freight, it may take days to pass through unloading and customs on certain routes.
The only way to get it quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The clearest way to fly first or business class is to spend significantly to qualify (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
Nevertheless, this doesn't come cheap: you can expect to pay around 4 times the usual economy rate for business and eleven times for first class, as a rough rule of thumb!
Generally speaking, there's no point in even trying to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there's a definite core flyer willing to pay top dollar for the special privilege of getting somewhere quickly and being charged accordingly for the amenities.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.

Despite the failure of political discussions, economic ties were restored between these two parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, and the second largest port after Istanbul. It is also a major transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, surrounded by mountains and situated around a large gulf.
Although the city has a Mediterranean European feel rather than a traditional Turkish one, the wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red tile roofs, an 18th-century market, and old churches and synagogues.

Visit the sacred site of Our Lady of Fatima (Church), world-renowned among the places where Mary appeared.
Please remember that you are visiting a site of great significance, in a way that a large, perhaps prominent, segment of the world's population may not be able to comprehend.
Numerous men and women who have outlived their time still live here, either condemned to be killed or to work until death, along with many people dear to them, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the site with all due respect, honor, and decorum it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the sculptures by marking graffiti, scratching or otherwise damaging them.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half the population prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.

The Plitvice Lakes National Park is a heavily wooded area, mainly featuring beech, fir and spruce, as well as a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the extent of microclimates, the different soil types, and the altitude above sea level, it has a large variety of plant species.
This place is a habitat for a wide variety of birds and animals.
Rare fauna like the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can also be found here.
When visiting ashrams, women should wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries, coverings are provided for women who arrive without precautions, but if you bring one, especially one with a bright color, then you are likely to receive a smile from the monk or nun right at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover up to their knees.
These skirts can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but since not everyone washes them after use, wearing them won't feel very comfortable. One size fits all men!

Pre-modern astronomical observatories are now obsolete, and they remain as museums or educational sites.
The minor pollution of their youth was not as much of a problem as it is now; it usually occurred in cities or campuses that were easily accessible, unlike the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were a beloved flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by emperors, exclusively for themselves and other prestigious members of the royal family.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural setting, which resists the urge to remove them, even if it's a "single" specimen.

All the animals that first arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
The giant tortoise couldn't become the first grazing animal in the Galapagos on that journey due to the great distance from continental mammals.
After humans arrived in the Galápagos, numerous mammals including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs also arrived.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
