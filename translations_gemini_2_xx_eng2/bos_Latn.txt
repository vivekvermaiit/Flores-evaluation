This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is an already known theory, but also provides details that fossils most often cannot, relating to colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on top, with a pale or yellowish-orange-red underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis was likely part of a later evolutionary development compared to the other characteristics.
The structure of these feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers state that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult, not a young, individual.
Research has shown that, even though this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult feathers and not chick feathers.
A car bomb detonated yesterday at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured over twenty other people.

They discovered that the Sun functions on the same basic principles as other stars. It was determined that the activity of all stars in the system is governed by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic field reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and thus causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most dark matter is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and consists of many small particles.

Voting in France is conducted without technology. Voters are isolated in a booth and place a pre-printed paper ballot, on which they mark their chosen candidate, into an envelope.
After the officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
These procedures are quite strictly regulated by French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are inserted into the box except for those cast by properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In her second race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four female Paralympic skiers failed to finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to complete the race.
Police in the Madhya Pradesh region found and returned a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have also found and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been appearing before the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh since then, accused of the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness testimony could be dismissed because her picture has been published many times.
That is standard practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently, and the courts have considered it possible that the publication of photographs could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists really seem to be walking a fine line when publishing photographs of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is fully responsible for criminal prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be given, at least until an indictment is filed.
According to leaked information, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine wants to base on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in this valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA accepts a military presence of only five years.
Shooters in the supplemental pest control trial program were to be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited in accordance with the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage for the park within NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed safety briefings and training.
Yesterday, in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), nine members were sworn in before Martelly.
That is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed that the previous CEC resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
At times, violent protests have erupted due to the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had information on 27 accidents related to those devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company states are "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (Friday at 09:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management has announced that no damage has been reported in the country.
Additionally, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no tsunami indicators.
A former police officer from the Philippines held tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children, the elderly, and photographers from the Philippines, were released earlier.
The photographers later took the older lady's place when she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins embarked on a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the Auckland State Women's Hospital.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he researched premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that introducing hormones will accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two "black boxes" for recording flight data.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as weird as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
As part of the campaign for the 2010 federal election, the Prime Minister of the interim government, Julia Gillard, argued that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of respondents who wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch in Australia.
The survey revealed two kinds of extreme views: 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, and in three stages at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is in doubt due to complaints.
He couldn't take the medication needed to relieve the pain because those medications were banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
By early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source for delivering water to Earth along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, a 53-year-old star, became governor at the beginning of this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political babbling and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of outdated ground-based radar technology, so that air traffic controllers can locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transport services, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parks and bus-to-rail interchange parking facilities are not available near the stadium.
Fear of lack of transportation has increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science made claims about the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was believed that the process took much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into different shapes. It can be twisted into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemicals are.
The pH level is represented by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, then use clean, wet hands to form them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, leading to a strange sensation and creating a type of protection.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet that was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes parts of public baths where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a signal and then reflects it back down almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
To put a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel provided us with is much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us a train, a car, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are mid-sized cats that eat moderately sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including lost pet cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special skill that each cat possesses and which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats and live in large groups called prides.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
The women are usually closely connected to each other because it is a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions function similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals whose behavior is surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats), and also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger, like a true multi-sport athlete, can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of angrily shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are far smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find the animals they prey on based on scent, by sniffing the ground where these animals have been.
They see very well in the dark due to their night vision, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, during a crossing over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island, making it difficult to return), they will often find themselves in an environment that differs from the environment they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population, in order to be a strong competitor, will need different characteristics or adaptation compared to what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce food through photosynthesis using the sun. They also provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time. It feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws contained more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra row on the roof of his mouth, meaning there was no hope for any creature that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but she may have had a forked tongue. Her diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and she may have even been a cannibal.
It would attack anything that entered the water. Even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex was no match for it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans also ate some strange or unusual food at feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
The second difference was that, while poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to throw banquets together where they would lounge on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman dishes could not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, which was considered the home of that deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could access.
Sometimes, special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
A large part of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just open cash registers facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was incredibly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norwegian sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each state was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not correct. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text is written upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large document on parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was initially rolled up and placed in the archives.
Therefore, it's possible that the note was added simply as a marker.
With the landing in Normandy (D-Day) and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
Northern France was ruled by the French "Vichyites." These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
The Allies attacked southern France on August 15, 1940, in an assault named "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word "civilis," which means civic and refers to the Latin word "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, which in a way defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a long-lasting cultural trace, and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
According to the Articles of Confederation, during the Revolutionary War, the thirteen allied states first formed a weak central government, whose only component was the Congress.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and given that there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state bodies, which often did not cooperate, to implement its acts.
He also did not have the authority to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
Members sought the full agreement of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful national team in the world and they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 auto racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by noted the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a change in Aboriginal grain production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire.
Following their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
In Machu Picchu, there are three main structures - Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better insight into what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration has continued to the present day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which dominated at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its display format was adopted in the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing - 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or approximate this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in the image.
It is stated that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, found itself under control.
The Christian religion has connected European countries for over a thousand years, despite different languages and customs.
Her dominant strength influenced everyone - from the king to the common man.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds should serve precisely that purpose.
The central body of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and due to this concentration of power and money, many wonder if this rule is being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of conflict, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian necessities, although this blockade violated internationally accepted law codified in several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering parts of the ocean, posing a danger even to ships of neutral countries.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States after accepting a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods. Each phase in Chinese history, or each ruling family, was a recognizable dynasty.
Also, the period between each dynasty represented a period of divided provinces. The most famous such period was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, fierce wars were waged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the professions of the revolution were opened to all male applicants, it allowed the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the military, because instead of military ranks being ranked based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in topics beyond this earthly life. He often spent time in the cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) and contemplated.
The cave itself, which has survived all times, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find him even if someone knows he exists. Once you enter the cave, it's complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear, beautiful sky and numerous mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many great pyramidal structures built to glorify the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, is a series of pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" mark looks like a V, and the "down-bow" mark looks like a bracket or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Drawing the bow upwards usually creates a softer sound, while drawing the bow downwards is stronger and more declarative.
Feel free to write your fingerings in pencil, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical purposes and should be respected.
A terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to have the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the mafia was waving the head of a Royal Guard member, killed in Versailles, in front of the terrified Queen.
The costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to cover a large portion of the costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits stemming from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the fundamental gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, it's necessary to understand the context that prompted the order's founding.
The era in which these events took place is usually referred to as the medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which was conventionally agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice implies a wide range of ideas, from technological impetus or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by the fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their representation in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond the influence of culture or politics, and that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country is not economically sustainable for just a few cars, which is why new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher number of traffic accidents, which leads to the discovery of new techniques in healthcare for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, adopted from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture emerged connected to those geographical areas, and these, in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
His status declined in the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valued than anything the Byzantine market had to offer.
At that time, the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The style of dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was when people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture whose goal is to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds from a specific eco-region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar worldviews who feel neglected by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be recognized by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that make a subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their belonging through the specific and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to point to several unfortunate cases of children who were not provided with socialization during their development by adults due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "feral" children. Some feral children were held captive (usually by their parents); in some cases, children were abandoned because their parents rejected their serious intellectual or physical disabilities.
Rejected children may have experienced violence or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is believed that the remaining ones raised animals. Some are thought to have lived independently in the wild.
After being completely raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limitations) that completely resembles the behavior of the animal that cared for it, such as fear and indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is meant to make learning simpler and more interesting, the "scaffolding" method goes a step further.
"Scaffolding" is not a learning method, but rather an assistive tool that provides support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Help can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is one form of help, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into software and are intended for testing, guiding, and explaining procedures that could pose a challenge for a student who needs to carry them out independently.
Children enter the foster care system for various reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even coercion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where care, affection, and education are not expressed, but it happens.
We believe that the Foster Care system represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should meet all the needs that were unmet in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The various characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of access, benefits, and satisfaction of needs.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motives for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
"When researching audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "continuous connections" as new aspects of motivation."
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, one can detect whether a person is lying.
In his work, "Presidential Speech," Oliver Sacks noted that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even points out that animals like domestic dogs may have such abilities in interpreting human behavior.
Twentieth-century research has revealed the existence of two types of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations between these two bases in each generation.
For primates with a digestive system similar to humans, it can be difficult to meet amino acid requirements from available plant resources in the savanna.
Furthermore, failure to act accordingly leads to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Unlike them, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a huge amount of protein containing essential amino acids.
When everything is taken into account, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees do it today in the savannas.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during a normal sleep period and going back to sleep again sometime later (10-60 minutes).
That can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, you can leave it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm involve consuming a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bed, which will force the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present will be. Every person has the potential to find their absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal are our own tensions and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of total love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, conflicts between systems, processes, and cultures led to disagreements between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, through proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already been broken, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became practically obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern parts of Poland, thereby violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of cargo and a large number of people across the ocean.
The job of the navy is traditionally to ensure that the country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, as well as to simultaneously hinder the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this practice is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to provide assistance to Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, tried to stop this trade.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain the way it conquered the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were most often kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and were often herded by goat herders, mostly children or adolescents, who are similar to today's shepherds. These livestock farming methods are still used today.
Wagons were being produced in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve greater speeds and haul more cargo than was possible on the somewhat uneven roads of that time.
Railway sleepers were introduced fairly early on to fix the rails. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be much more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
That became a common practice, but the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced with iron wheels. The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, australopithecines, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been observed in australopithecine fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although there is a possibility that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can even be activists in order to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This resembles symptomatic treatment in many cases. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clear that the world has changed considerably due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and that problems have become greater due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the nearby printing shop of John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 copies, today known as "Dunlap broadsides," were made during the night.
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document on July 8th, in the yard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and exists even today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind two legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for a diagnosis to be made right away.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open box of medications or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists in a formal context for this group of insects.
This expression stems from a long-standing acquaintance with bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and common bed bugs are crimson, adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease of young adults and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
The couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise the baby.
These couples can decide to make a plan to adopt a baby.
In the adoption process, biological parents relinquish their parental rights, so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works using the scientific method. In fact, most scientific research is guided by this method.
However, it's not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but also asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not only represent responses to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in a large number of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to run even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeled the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the specific part of the genetic material, and whether germ cells are affected.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns on the outskirts in their cars and head to their workplaces, passing those who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected and supportive, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this high-carbon emission economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges falling apart.
Why do transportation systems elicit such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave quite consistently. Therefore, traffic flow has a kind of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three fundamental characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily escape predators and to more effectively search for food and mates.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This provides them with a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings back today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but most believed the opposite – that the Solar System, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
Sounds reasonable, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and, at the same time, the largest river on Earth. It has more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is both the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from rivers into oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical perfection of construction.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were already over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
Italian is both an everyday language spoken by the majority of employed people in that country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their native form and can be relatively easily extracted using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances and build what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil has been a good friend to many since its invention.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer writing methods, the pencil has fallen to a lower status and is used less frequently.
People now type messages on computers and never have to get a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that requires energy to assemble a nucleus with a multitude of protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Re-splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
Thinner under the seas, and thicker under the mountains.
There might be more Marie on the closer side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates or attracts people to certain behaviors.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they outgrow during maturation towards adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want what they do and what in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of satisfaction are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating staff, assigning tasks, and demanding accountability from employees.
On the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the one who bears the responsibility for both the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in disagreement between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, yet some minor differences exist.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than other team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The invisible team" is a management team to which each member is accountable. This team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of organizing in which collaboration aims to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in specific mental functions.
Advances in new technologies allow us to observe and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a large amount of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction context, it represents an extremely significant branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning, and sequencing, the ability to provide responses to diagnoses and client questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
Today, artificial intelligence systems are frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and they are also incorporated into several home computer applications and video games.
Field trips are a significant part of every class. Often, the teacher would like to take her students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
A virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a webpage about their trip to the state capital; that webpage changes every year, but the old versions are kept online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Considering that students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to cater to the interests of the audience inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend the learning process beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can encourage students to start thinking more analytically and critically. By actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others are writing and can express their own opinion on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The city of Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, home to numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls are located further south, and to the north lies the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and other regions.
All of this, and much more, highlights Ontario as what outsiders consider quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some represent almost uninhabited wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many: the US has more African Americans than Canada has citizens.
East African islands are in the Indian Ocean along the right coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and represents a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts with beaches.
Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, which became particularly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and the conquest of colonies began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area to the north is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It can also help if you're wearing a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a fisherman from the Berber tribe in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake that occurred in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Beida, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, for example, tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of geomags, but it's all made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers one of the most affordable Mountain Gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short ride is approximately 500 Congolese francs.
Due to the fact that it is quite inaccessible, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although due to its reputation it is a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main locations featured during the PBS special Wonders of the African World, hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic than an African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the Crocodile River forms the southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It represents one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading South African National Park (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can be useful to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry into some parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the Hong Kong territory its name and is a place that many tourists consider the main point of visit.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is linked to a dazzling graph visible thanks to the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon Harbour on the other side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban area is densely situated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place that British colonizers took for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, you can start at this place.
Sundarban is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just saltwater swamps - they include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km², of which almost one-third of the surface is covered by water/wetland areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that around 400 royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 spotted deer live in this area today.
Buses depart from the bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most counties are served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxi rides are a fast and easy way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters in height, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous community that lived in the area of present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "Giant Province of the Indies," was founded in the 16th century after encounters between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous native groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the largest annual tournament is held on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here, small tournaments and matches can be followed at any time of the year.
For news about tournaments and places where you can buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which has the same value as one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, it is possible to exchange money at the only bank located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, although British currency and United States currency might be; check with the owners in advance what payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave them.
Considering that Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there is during the time when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; temperatures above +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to encountering people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities require you to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Despite appearing like docile animals, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous. So give them space.
Besides, don't forget that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant food products and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
Luka was the site of a notorious maritime standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland borders two harbors. The most famous beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch along Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and a large number get shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upper suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good assortment of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Broj 1" (Number 1), and it's not a complex beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that can be drunk, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for traveling.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are worried, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," a cappuccino comes with a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but they are excellent.
Throughout the year, trips to the ridge are organized, and injuries on the ridge are rare.
However, listen to the advice the authorities are giving you, respect all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of the city 1770. They can occasionally be spotted outside of this period as well.
Sharks exist, however they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean full-time. Their primary habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing they will have accommodation after arriving at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you might see that it's possible to book other forms of accommodation through the agency, such as campsites.
Travel agencies commonly offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination of flights and hotel accommodations.
They can hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer or obtain other documents needed for traveling to that destination (e.g., a visa).
All changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agency, and not directly to the hotel.
When it comes to some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to get in early to snag a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the musical content on the main stages is finished, music may be playing in some parts of the festival until late at night.
At some festivals, there are designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of your cabin because passing through the ice causes terrible noise for those who are most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos typically invest significant effort in maximizing the money and time that guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and retain them at the premises.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served on the house. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all experienced gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and it's not possible to drive as you would on clear asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall very quickly to get you stuck.
Visibility may be limited by falling snow or blizzard conditions, or by condensation or ice forming on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal occurrences in many countries, and traffic usually continues to flow smoothly throughout the year.
A safari is perhaps the best tourist experience in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to a journey by land to see the stunning African wilderness, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach the cars closely, and the standard equipment will allow you a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better if you look through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk", "safari walk", or "trekking safari") consists of hiking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some sporting events will also be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it already hosted them in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies caused by the coronavirus are not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets priced at around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can speed up their drying. In many hotels, it is possible to borrow an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available to you.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different methods for purifying water, some being more effective depending on the specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they have not seen in their own regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, an allergic reaction, spread poison, or transmit infectious diseases.
Communicable diseases, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are not usually classified as pests.
Shopping in duty-free stores is an opportunity to purchase products that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with high tax rates may sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as the road often passes through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay calm: the road is dominated by steep terrain, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence is even more important than usual.
It's interesting that the cell phone reception is much stronger here than on many other sections of the route, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and diverse, similar to those made by their southern neighbors, the Austrians.
Fruity pastries are common - apples are cooked in dough throughout the year, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often make a good combination with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try the pastry that, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. Coconut milk is frequently used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, if used without additional qualifiers, the term usually refers to food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, features a range of simply seasoned dishes. The dominant flavors favored by Javanese people are peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer the rider greater stability, but can cause safety problems because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot remains in the stirrup, the horse could drag them if it starts to run. To minimize the risk, many safety measures can be taken as a precaution.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a flat, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather stirrup straps to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls on them during a fall.
In the Cochamó Valley, a top climbing destination in Chile known as the Yosemite of South America, lie various granite big walls and cracks.
The ascents feature breathtaking views from the summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes through its endless potential of walls.
Snow sports that involve descending slopes, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one descends a snow-covered terrain on skis or a board attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a primary travel activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski fanatics," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It's related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but usually doesn't include them, with the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski slope as a trail similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking, but you will rarely achieve cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through the visa application and passport control process multiple times.
However, in that regard, the Schengen area acts as one country.
As long as you are in this zone, you can cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each member country of the Schengen system, which saves time, money, and reduces paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines which objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade items could be defined as antiques, even though they are newer compared to similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and raised reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many members of the Sámi people are involved in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the area where the Sámi live.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani populations, the word "Cigan" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are planning to visit becomes subject to travel warnings, this may affect your travel or trip cancellation insurance.
You can also consult advice from governments that are not your own, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
One example is the fact that American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice represents only a summary of the political situation in a given country.
The views expressed are often short, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
A storm is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Adverse weather events can occur anywhere in the world. These events can be of various types, which may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Storms, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, showers, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of any risks to their area from the storm, as severe weather may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should have professional training.
Searching the internet for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely lead you to the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the discussed issues in much more detail, often with practical experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications that address the topic of war zones.
Travelers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return journey.
There is an uneven readiness among governments to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to act in accordance with these documents also varies greatly.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanners and maintain their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are return flows of waves that hit the shore, often a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and rapid currents towards deep water can occur there.
Most fatalities occur due to exhaustion that sets in when a swimmer tries to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you break free from the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to aim somewhere you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock comes before cultural shock (there is less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more difficult.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers needed to adjust to a new country.
People may not expect that both patience and understanding are necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light effects of the pyramids are some of the most interesting things in the children's area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can also see them in the silence before the show begins.
You usually always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is positioned in the background and narrates a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and have the most bases there, with as many as sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with a settlement called Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston and Deception Islands, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge into a plateau, then rise again into the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, cleaved by the Minnesota Glacier.
Most of the mountains in Antarctica are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range, called the Vinson Massif, whose peak, Mount Vinson, is 4892 m high.
In remote areas with no mobile network coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you have to make calls outdoors, with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used in cargo transport by ship, including recreational vessels, as well as in expeditions that require long-range data and voice message exchange.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
It is becoming an increasingly popular option for those who plan to travel and learn for a year.
This is very popular among high school graduates, as it allows them to take a gap year before enrolling in university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can actually improve your chances of transitioning to higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees are usually charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands on its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht on archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The activity is almost the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Most diverse Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historical city for a few days and return to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore as part of a boat trip, you will not need a special visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
That's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome fear based on the unknown and a lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for the fast delivery of goods. Time is often of the utmost importance for business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
For some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes, even smaller companies have encountered problems.
If items are shipped by air, unloading and customs clearance may take several days on some routes.
The only way for the frying pan to get through was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to travel first or business class is to splash out and fork over a heap of money for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this isn't cheap: you can generally expect to pay up to four times more than the regular economy class price for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in even asking for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is used in many places.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has gone through ethnic conflict.
That conflict in 1994 resulted in the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has a government and currency, but has not received recognition from any UN member state.
Economic ties have been established between these two parts of Moldova, despite unsuccessful political negotiations.
The most widespread religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with close to 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
It was once the ancient city of Smyrna, and now it is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are juxtaposed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, although this city feels more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
Above some of the tombs in the churchyard are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It was worth taking a half-hour walk through the intriguing village.
North of and near the city is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron recorded a dazzling account of its splendor.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly travels to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the large Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (sanctuary), a place of Marian apparitions that are known throughout the world.
Don't forget that you are essentially visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a place of immeasurable significance to a huge part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who outlived their time here, and many more whose loved ones were killed here or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this place with the dignity, formality, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by making or carving graffiti on the buildings.
In Barcelona, Catalan and Spanish are the official languages. Almost half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan since it is the primary official language by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled service disruptions are announced by an automated system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for their reputation as being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, behaving politely, like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered), is still the best way to get along with others in Paris. It will make getting around much easier.
The Parisians' abrupt exterior will quickly disappear if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is situated in large forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, and boasts a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to the range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes, it has a very wide variety of plant communities.
This area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knee and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially those with bright colors, you'll receive a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that reach below the knee.
You can also borrow this at the entrance, but the clothing isn't washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these robes. One size fits all for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like cuisines from similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli - bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available spices and additions like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, together with the word Sie for "you," are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This can undoubtedly make reading easier, although writing is somewhat more complex due to the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You need to pay attention to the letters c and g because their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently - caro means dear, and carro means chariot.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly straightforward grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you speak another Romance language.
However, people with a limited knowledge of Spanish might rashly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to require separate study.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and maintained as museums or places for education.
Given that mild pollution at their peak was not the problem it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, and are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures in remote locations with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
That concept originated in China, where the plum blossom was the flower of choice.
The emperor organized the first cherry blossom viewing party in Japan only for himself and other members of the aristocracy gathered around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formally organized garden, you will also be kicked out without discussion for collecting "samples".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay where it is easy to get around, and you can buy almost everything after arrival.
However, if you are in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to endure both the heat (always) and the strong sun (less often when the sky is clear).
Several buses are heading north towards Hebron, the traditional site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Check if the bus you plan to travel with goes to Hebron as well, and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the day of Jesus' birth.
Many traditions associated with holidays have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to stay awake on Easter night and watch the sunrise in an open space.
Of course, there are also Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with parishioners beginning the celebration at exactly midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals failed to reach the island, which made the giant tortoise the main herbivore in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have also arrived, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark for 24 hours.
Light pollution is often not a problem because the areas are sparsely populated, and you will be able to enjoy the view of the stars.
Japanese work culture is based on hierarchy and formalities more than Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and employees address each other by last names or positions they hold.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial because it emphasizes the effort of the group rather than individual achievements.
