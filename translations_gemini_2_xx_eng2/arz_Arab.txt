It doesn't just confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a well-known theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally can't, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top and pale, or carotenoid-colored, on its underside.
The discovery gives us a deep insight into the subject of feather development in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a long, large spine, but they do have other characteristics, like barbs and hooks. However, researchers found that the spine was probably something that resulted from later evolution of these other characteristics.
The structure of the wings indicates they weren't used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or display. And the researchers say that although the dinosaur's tail is small, the sample shows that the feathers are large, not small.
The researchers said that even though this is a small dinosaur tail, the sample shows the feathers of a mature bird, not the feathers of a chick.

They discovered that the sun operates according to the same principles as other stars: and they found that the activity of all stars in the system is determined only by their brightness and rotation.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
When the Rossby number decreases, the star's activity in terms of magnetic flares diminishes.

But the work that's finished is mostly theoretical, it's just that the program was written to simulate the observations that were recorded about the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by tidal forces existing between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way galaxy.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way galaxy attract the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy.
Scientists were able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter affects it.
This theory explains that most of the dark matter present around a galaxy remains around it, resembling a halo, and is composed of tiny particles in vast numbers.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech affair: voters seclude themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot showing their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials check the voter's ID, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a strict and very precise way.
Since 1988, it became mandatory for ballot boxes to be transparent so that voters and observers can ensure that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting, and that no envelopes are added except for those of registered voters who are authorized according to protocol.
The candidates can send representatives on their behalf to observe every part of the process. And at night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and following specific procedures.

The bill mandates placing a sticker with "18" on violent video games sold in California, and imposes a $1000 fine for each violation and on anyone who sells them to a minor.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, issued a statement this morning announcing the trial of Huhne and Pryce.
He resigned and they will replace him in the cabinet with the Member of Parliament, Ed Davey. It is expected that Member of Parliament Norman Lamb will take the position of Business Secretary, which Davey will leave.
They will meet on February 16th with Warren and Price at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Among the casualties were Nicholas Alden, who was 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, who was 21 years old, and Cuddeback worked as a driver.
Edgar Figueroa sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, but Christopher Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
Schneider suffers from constant pain, blindness in one eye, and has lost part of his skull and had his face reconstructed with titanium, all of which happened while Oka's weapon was pointed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider gave his testimony via video link from a US Air Force base located in his country.
Carpanedo entered two individual races in the championship because of what we saw on Wednesday.
The first race I participated in was the slalom ski race, but the result wasn't great; I didn't finish the race past the first round. I got 36th place out of 116 competing for the same result in that race.
In the second race, which was the giant slalom skiing race, I took tenth place in the women's sitting category after a time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who took first place, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani who took ninth place.
In the women's race, four contestants didn't finish, and 45 out of 117 registered contestants didn't score points in the giant slalom.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we returned her mobile phone and laptop to her."
The names of the accused are Baba Kangar, Butha Kanga, Rambro Kangar, Gaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused stood in front of the court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
But the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he went to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that moment on, they accused Adekoya of killing her son in the honorable Edinburgh court.
She's being held in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted because her picture has already been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have deemed that publishing photos could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said that "it seems clear to me that journalists are heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or anything similar related to suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Office, which is generally responsible for trials, told reporters that it would not comment further, at least until charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document refers to the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants based on the borders that existed before the war that happened in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is an important issue for both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel is requesting the continuation of military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years, immediately after an agreement is expected, but the Palestinian Authority is only agreeing to this presence continuing for five years.
The guards had to heavily supervise the released individuals during the supplemental pest control experiment, and the experiment was being conducted and its effectiveness evaluated.
A partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia has identified qualified volunteers in the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director of Parks and Heritage Protection at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt received intensive safety guideline and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday at a new interim electoral council composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the interim electoral council, and this is part of a set of measures to organize new elections in the country.
The committee was like Martelli's response to the large protests against the regime that started in October.
The protests, which were violent at times, arose due to the failure to hold the elections that were scheduled to be held since 2011.
A report was filed concerning approximately 60 malfunctions and overheating incidents involving the iPod, which resulted in roughly six fires and four minor burn injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was aware of the 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, Meta announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more incidents that caused overheating, which the company described as "non-critical."
The ministry responded to Apple's request for postponement by saying it was a "real shame."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (Friday 9:19 PM GMT).
The emergency management office in the Northern Mariana Islands said that there was no damage in the country.
One of the people working at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there are no indications that a tsunami could occur.
A policeman working for the government dared to kidnap tourists from Hong Kong as hostages after he kidnapped their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired shots at the tourists from his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six have died so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children, elderly people, and also Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the restroom, and then they opened fire on Mendoza.
Leggings followed in his father's footsteps and medicine became his profession.
He trained to become an obstetrician and worked at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Legins started investigating premature births in his free time, when he was working at the hospital.
His research showed that taking the hormone can make the fetus's lung grow faster.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the flight recorders, or what is known as the black boxes, on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers praised Luna too.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna, passed away on the night of the two moons. A strong woman, one of a kind."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was weird like me... and maybe even more than me... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the proportion opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by eight percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she sees Australia should be a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed agree with this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In the latest survey results we saw, 29 percent believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist's fitness is now in doubt due to his complaining, especially since he was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He can't take the medicine he needs to overcome his pain because it's prohibited in sports.
Curtis Cooper, who works as a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, succeeded in discovering the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
A few people verified the discovery, using different devices and software, starting in February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are considered a source of water delivery to Earth, in addition to the organic matter that could form proteins and make life possible.
Scientists are hoping to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed since the collision of comets with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, began his term at the beginning of this year and signed a bill into law last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He said that these rumors are just "trivial, silly political things".
It is expected that he will run for president in 2016.
The next generation system, which the Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
She's using a method that connects satellites, unlike the old method where ground radar was used to help air traffic controllers pinpoint the planes' location with great accuracy and provide pilots with very specific information.
There will be no extra transportation, local public transport trains will not stop at Wembley, and there will be no parking or gardening/mobility facilities at the stadium.
Fears of transportation shortages have raised the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors without fans in attendance.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science says that a new species of bird has appeared in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden said that the evolution of new species continued for only two generations, even though it was believed that this process would take a very long time due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, the immigrant cactus finch, and the ground finch with a single beak.
Gold can be manufactured into all possible shapes. It can also be formed into small shapes.
And you can pull it into a thin wire that you can wrap and twist, and you can also hammer it or wrap it into the shape of leaves.
We can make it very thin and stick it to another metal. And it can be so thin that it was used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is what we call the pH level of the chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance we want to test.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (that's because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Gently mix the dry ingredients and squeeze them with a clean, damp hand so they form a ball shape.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a sort of covering.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a flushing mechanism in almost every house connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were at certain times part of public baths because men and women would go to them together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the view.
The matter requires a giant rocket, more than 100 feet long, to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way, but providing an easier and faster means of transportation is the most important thing it contributed for us.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other types of transportation.
Among them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
In conclusion, there are small cats (including stray and pet cats) that eat smaller prey that are more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The reason for their success was the concept of status, a specific job for each cat to prevent them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions has one to three adult males, and alongside them, there are thirty females and cubs.
Usually, the females are close to each other because they're essentially one big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides are behaving like packs of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is very similar to lions (but not other big cats), and they are also very deadly to their prey.
Because he is a distinguished athlete, the tiger can climb (even if he's not great at it), and he can swim and jump long distances, and also pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. And these four are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's full-throated roar, but it's closer to sounding like a shout with angry words.
Dwarf mongooses like to eat small animals, and they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the dwarf mongoose hunts are smaller than it in size.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell; they also smell their locations in the ground.
You can see well in the dark through night vision, and it moves stealthily too. Also, dwarf tiger animals hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main group they came from (for example, when they migrate across a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
Because this new environment has different resources and competitors, this nascent group will need different characteristics or adaptive mechanisms to become a stronger competitor compared to the strength it needed before.
There has been no change to the native inhabitants at all, they still require the same methods of adaptation as we knew about them.
As time passes and the new inhabitants begin to adapt to their new environment, their resemblance to the other inhabitants gradually decreases.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will be so different that we won't consider them the same species anymore.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Her elongated jaws were fixed with over 70 blade-like teeth and another set in the roof of her mouth, meaning nothing stood a chance against her.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he may have been a carnivore.
They also attacked everything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't stand against them.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual holiday fare, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
There was also something different, which was that while the needy and the women would eat their food sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have banquets where they would recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals couldn't have contained foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and the ancient Romans didn't eat turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's house.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to fulfill the gods' needs during celebrations and festivals.
In every temple, there's an open courtyard with a secluded, secure chamber that only the priests can enter.
There were times when distinctive pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe place for the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, the house is of no importance whatsoever.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters overlooking the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There weren't large forests in the land of Canaan, that's why wood was expensive.
Humans inhabited Greenland sparsely. Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even without considering his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living in these areas.
Even though every country was "Scandinavian," there were still many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might feel like a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not correct. Even though there's something written on the back of the paper, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" written on its back. The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the writer of this part of the text is unknown, we know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
That's why, it's possible the symbol was added simply as a label.
The landings that took place on the famous day and the subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was under the rule of the French "Vichy" government. They were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, meaning a society.
The origin of the word "civilization" is the Latin word "civilis," which means "civil," and is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and this also defines it in terms of a communal mass.
The city is the first step in building countries. Civilizational culture, in its essence, is the transmission of knowledge from one generation to another and a cultural footprint that is favored and distributed fairly.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving any real historical evidence, and they are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government, with Congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, they relied on state authorities, who were mostly uncooperative, to enforce all of its laws.
She also didn't have the authority to bypass tax laws and customs duties between states.
The bill required approval from all states before it could be amended, and the states mocked the central government to the point that their representatives were mostly absent.
The Italian national football team, and also the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world, and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the archipelago system/island group that exists in Japan, they used to say that Japan, geographically, is an "archipelago."
Taiwan began its journey back in the 15th century when European sailors passing by wrote the island's name as "Ilha Formosa," or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing the production practices of native grains and employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar farms.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty armies (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu contains three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common format for still photography in the world is 35mm, which was the most widespread film format at the end of the era of analog films.
Production is still ongoing until today, but more importantly, the image sensor format in digital cameras inherited its aspect ratio.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio in this picture is (either divide by 12 to get the ratio to the simplest integer), so it will be 3:2.
It's equal to or very close to common formats (Advanced Photo System formats, for example) for this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which they often misuse and even mock, provides a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in a clear image.
The most impactful location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was under scrutiny by investigative authorities during this period of European history.
Christianity tied European countries together for over a thousand years, despite their differences in language and customs.
The sweeping power he possessed had an impact on everyone, from the king to the common people.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the cash funds in the church exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many people question whether this doctrine was fulfilling what's required.
Britain hastened to impose a naval blockade on Germany after skirmishes and confrontations emerged.
The strategy proved effective; vital military and civilian supplies were cut off, despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law that has been written and codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain planted a mine in international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the oceans, and this is something that threatens even neutral ships.
Because there was a limited response to that tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, peace and isolationism were the stance favored by most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the disasters brought about by World War I, the countries wanted to avoid it happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to work with Edison's company in New York City.
He came to America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique system, and amazingly, they referred to specific periods in history; they referred to each period of China or each dynasty in power as being distinct.
There was also an unstable period with the division of provinces between each family. And the most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, a strong war broke out between many nobles who wanted to reach the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
The social and political impacts are numerous, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolute rule to a republic, nationalism, and the conviction that the state belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the revolution, jobs were mainly to fill positions with young men, and it was more of an opportunity for those with ambition to progress.
The same thing happened in the army because instead of army ranks being based on class, they now depend on caliber.
The French Revolution also influenced many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, was very interested in things that transcend this worldly life. And he used to go to a cave called Hiraa, on top of the Mountain of Light, to contemplate.
The cave that the Prophet entered and that still exists in every era presents itself as a very vivid image of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, and it's completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's never easy to find him, even if you know he exists. Once he enters the cave, he's in complete isolation.
There's nothing you can see except the clear, beautiful sky above the many surrounding mountains. And you can't see or hear much of anything inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the pharaohs in the 3rd century BC, is a large pyramidal structure they built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" located in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upstroke" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "downstroke" symbol looks like a stapler or a square with the bottom side missing.
An upper mark indicates that we should start from the tip and push the bow, while a lower mark means we must start from the end of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is a bit stronger and more intense.
Don't hesitate to sketch your markings in pencil, but remember that printed curved markings are there for a musical reason, so they need to be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by many people who were screaming and chanting against the King and Queen.
A group of fans managed to force the King and Queen to fully open the windows of their car.
At one point, one of the gang members waves the head of one of the royal guards who was killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the price for the American imperialist war in its invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to bear a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Naturally, the massive profits coming from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are what will form the core gains of American imperialism.
We need to understand the context that drives the creation of the organization in order to comprehend the Knights Templar.
The era in which all these events occurred was the High Middle Ages, which is the period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, all of which end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas, ranging from technological dynamism or technological necessity to the strict view that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that this technology, in turn, has an inherent and socially unconditional "impact" on the culture of society.
For example, someone might say that a car's engine leads to the development of bridges.
Establishing a road network spanning the entire country has no economic benefit if it's only for a few cars. That's why they're developing new roads to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning cars collectively also leads to a higher rate of traffic accidents, which results in the invention of new healthcare methods to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism was largely based on a cultural determinism derived from books by figures like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
With the advent of the Romantic movement, geography began to shape individuals, and over time, customs and culture developed that were related to this geography. These individuals, because they were at peace with the place of their community, were better than laws that were imposed forcibly.
Paris is famous for being the fashion capital of the world now, but Constantinople was the fashion capital of Europe during the feudal era.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Her situation weakened during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusades returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which had a higher value than what the Byzantine markets offered.
But at that time, Paris became the capital of fashion instead of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th and the 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Despite that, and due to the slow communication channels, the situations in the West could be delayed by about 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, due to the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the type of agriculture whose goal is to produce just enough food, meaning only meeting the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming – which is often organic – is a simple system where they use seeds that were in storage and that are suitable for the region's ecosystem, along with crop rotation or other simple techniques in some way to increase yields.
Most farmers previously worked in subsistence agriculture, and this situation persists in many developing countries.
Subcultures work to unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, and these subcultures allow them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that define the distinctiveness of a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Subculture members signal their membership through a symbolically distinctive style involving clothing, affectation, and jargon.
Among the widespread methods they use to illustrate the significant role that socialization plays is relying on the few unfortunate cases of children who have suffered, through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, being socially unconnected to adults while growing up.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some stray children have been confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, they were abandoned by their parents due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced mistreatment during childhood, or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
There are suspicions that other animals raised them; and some say that some of them lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble the behaviors of their specific animal caregiver, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, the support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning isn't a learning method itself, but rather a supporting tool that provides assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual or in person, and in another way, the teacher is considered a form of interactive learning, and so is the paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Internal learning within the program is supported internally, and its goal is to raise questions, provide motivation, and explain procedures that might be difficult for the student to handle alone.
The kids are placed in state care because they face things like neglect, harm, and even extortion.
It's completely unacceptable for any child to grow up in an environment that's not based on nurturing, care, and education, but they're doing that.
We know that the alternative care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care must provide all the necessary things they lost in the homes they previously left.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the concept of "uses and gratifications."
For example, some people say that learning and socialization are key drivers for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eime and McCord (1998) identified personal involvement and ongoing relationships as new motivational aspects when they studied the public's reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions, which are facial movements that last for fractions of a second.
It is claimed, specifically, that one can discover if a person is lying or not by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks said in his paper that the president's speech says that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are able to assess sincerity with great credibility.
He's suggesting the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals, like pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research clarified the existence of two groups of genetic variations: a disappearing group and a visible one.
Mutation adds new genetic diversity, but selection removes it from the pool of phenotypic variation.
The separation and reassembly operations make the variance randomly fluctuate back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, the main mammals with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Your failure to do this will lead to serious consequences such as decreased growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The readily available plant resources were mostly proteins that we could get from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if they're not cooked.
On the other hand, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but it also provides a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
When we consider everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Sleep fragmentation is when you wake up intentionally during your sleep period after sleeping for a short time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively gentle alarm to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself snoozing the alarm repeatedly during your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Options based on the circadian rhythm include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less stress you have, the more positivity you gain, which gives you the strength to live. And everyone has the hidden ability to enjoy lasting peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve what they want. But the only thing that stops us on our path to our goal is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism relies on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and other methods taken from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations, especially with Kundalini Yoga.
The Tibetan Meditation Center embodies the deity yoga. Through visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness is created for enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and America, but when the war ended, the difference in systems, procedures, and cultures caused the conflict between the two countries to reappear.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies from before became enemies now and the Cold War began.
This war was supposed to last for the next forty years, with the fighting being on the ground, through proxy armies coming from Africa and Asia present on the battlefield in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
Despite that, these plans became outdated overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, which was a violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the job of the naval forces was to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
A modern example that must be noted is the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At that time, the German navy was trying to prevent the occupation by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to reach Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used them to easily access milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were raised in herds that roamed the hills and other grazing areas, and they were usually herded by goat herders who were children or teenagers, like the well-known shepherd, and these grazing methods are still used to this day.
Roads for carriages in England were built as far back as the 16th century.
Even though the old train carriages were just wooden planks lined up facing each other, they gave the horses a chance to pull them to be fast and also to pull heavy loads, especially if we compare it to the roads which were very rough at the time.
The cross braces were initially put in place to secure the rails. But gradually, they realized that if they installed a steel bar above the tracks, it would improve its efficiency.
This has become a common practice, but the iron caused corrosion to the wooden wheels of the carts.
In the end, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. And in 1767, they introduced the first complete iron rails.
Walking was the first means of transportation, and humans began to walk upright about two million years ago, which was when Homo erectus (meaning upright man) appeared.
The ancestors of Australopithecus didn't walk as upright as they used to.
Also, there are bipedal species in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a way that's more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we have to look for the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It's clear enough that the world has changed a lot due to human scientific and artistic progress, and the problems have become bigger because of the population increase and the luxurious lifestyle of humans.
After Congress warned on July 4th that there was a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, some of which had been sent to John Dunlap's printing press, some buildings away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy of it reached London on August 10th.
The twenty-five Dunlap broadsides represent the oldest surviving copies of the US Declaration of Independence document, but the original handwritten version did not survive.
Many paleontologists today are confident that one group of dinosaurs survived and is living today. We call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still like dinosaurs.
They have feet with layers of external protection and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
All computer devices used today virtually rely on processing encrypted information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit can only have one value out of two values, 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, if we're using computer language.
Internal poisoning might not show its symptoms immediately. Immediate diagnosis can't be based on common symptoms like vomiting.
The best indication of poisoning indoors might be the presence of an open container for medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to know the first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to these groups of insects.
This term comes from the old knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that have adapted greatly to parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs and kissing bugs share characteristics such as a long incubation period and the ability to live in their host's nest or dwelling.
Glory to America, it alone has around 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most prevalent neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
There's a man and woman who are looking at things from their own perspective, not from their best interest or the best interest of their young child, that they are raising a young child.
These couples can choose to set up an adoption plan for their children.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by using a scientific approach. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Despite that, she's not unique in this matter, and experimentation and testing are considered a trial that can be used to eliminate one or more of the potential hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, specifically the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all scientific subjects, even psychology.
When the level of knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior rely heavily, in many instances, on the existence of self-generated cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including those of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that operate cyclically, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the important pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to introduce their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to distinguish whether the bacteriophage was using radioactive phosphorus to label its DNA or radioactive sulfur to label its protein.
Mutations can have a range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells or not.
But mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the wild plant and animal life.
Examples of activities that can be done at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, photography, and getting to know orangutans in Borneo.
People drive from small towns every morning to get to their workplaces, and they encounter on the road other people who work in the places they just left.
And in this vibrant mode of transportation, everyone supports and is connected to a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has destabilized the atmosphere, which has supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone in the community participates and uses the transportation systems, and they all complain about the transportation systems.
It's rare to hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems cause these complaints and fail daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic, in its meaning, is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are difficult because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act rationally, and that's why traffic flow is balanced and can be represented in a very approximate way.
To better illustrate traffic flow, there are relationships between the three key characteristics: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and reach food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the length of their body.
This gives them a bigger range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people saw that he was right, but many saw the opposite, and that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It contains eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes its width is 6 miles.
20 percent of all the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River, praise be to God.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Even though pyramid construction using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing has surpassed the pyramids of Giza in size and artistic distinction in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of those who came before them, which had lasted for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
The Vatican City uses Italian to enact its legislation and for its official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most people working in the country, but Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known that there are essential chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all these elements can be found in nature in their original form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle put forward a theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are originally a mixture containing two or more metals. And don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also other minerals like silver and gold.
You can also take alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe was created from matter. And all matter was created from small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can be the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
Once again, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, when new writing tools appeared, the pencil's status diminished, and we only use it in rare cases.
People can now write messages on a computer screen without needing to use a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works by gathering energy to create a nucleus full of protons and neutrons.
It's like you're pushing a heavy cart up a hill. The nucleus splits again, and part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with a slight disturbance or even spontaneously.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. And the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust's thickness is about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
He's thinner in the Maria region and thicker in the highlands region.
There might be many lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on the idea that people search for what attracts and excites them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs or desires that emerge automatically once they reach puberty.
What issue do these theories deal with regarding what makes people do what they do, and the things in their environment that make them do, or not do, certain things?
Two popular theories for content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, there are two behaviors that can appear when managers start leading their former colleagues: one of them is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, conduct performance reviews, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable.
On the other hand, someone can turn into a person you wouldn't recognize, feeling like they have to change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
After all that, the leader is the one who bears the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate, physical teams.
And they usually have more autonomy than members of traditional teams because their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
Larson and LaFasto (1989, p109) describe the existence of a real shadow team as being a unique component compared to a hypothetical team.
The invisible team is the management team that every member reports to, and it's responsible for setting the standards for each member.
Why might an organization want to establish an educational organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is considered one of the goals of applying corporate learning concepts.
When you effectively utilize all available resources through the functional departments within the organization, creativity and ingenuity can be achieved.
As a result, internal collaboration within the organization to overcome difficulties can lead us to an innovative new process that fulfills the customer's needs.
Before the organization can be capable of innovation, management needs to create that culture, like innovation and knowledge sharing alongside education for the organization.
Engle (2006) explains a method called the "Continuity" approach, which is used to help organizations reach a high level of performance, sir.
Data related to neuroscience provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach when searching for knowledge. Thus, it reduces the search area and makes it very precise.
The connection between the pathology of the brain and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain cognitive functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the brain's structures and processes in ways we haven't seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is largely like science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence aims to make machines perform tasks automatically, and this requires a smart approach.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and it can also be used to recognize handwriting, voice, and faces.
These things have become separate fields that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are currently being used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. They've also been used to build a range of software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are considered a big part of any semester. Often the teacher might like to accompany her students to places that can't be reached by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their classmates.
Also, participating in a virtual field trip is a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but they keep the old versions online for record-keeping.
Blogging can help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with incorrect grammar and spelling, having an audience changes all that.
Given that students are the most critical audience a lot of the time, the blogger strives to improve their writing so as not to be subjected to criticism.
Blogs also "force students to be smart about the world around them." There is a motivation to feed public interest, and this makes students skilled and useful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that enables people to collaborate and encourages students to continue learning even after the regular school day.
The correct use of blogs makes students more analytical and critical through their active response to internet materials, identifying their position on others' writings, and also presenting their own points of view regarding specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of attractive Canada, which has two main languages and a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is in the far south, and the north is a place with untapped natural beauty, like Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario, as seen by foreigners, essentially Canadian, your Excellency.
Vast areas in the north have few inhabitants, and some of them are almost uninhabited.
For comparison regarding the population census that amazes many people: The number of African Americans residing in America is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and is considered an independent continent when discussing wildlife.
Most of the small islands are either independent countries or affiliated with France, and they are called luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs carried Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The beginning of European influence and colonization was in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama successfully navigated the Cape route, which connects Europe to India.
From the north, the Mediterranean Sea surrounds the region of North Africa, and the Atlantic Ocean surrounds it from the south and west.
Regarding women: Regardless of their actual marital status, women who are traveling must declare that they are married.
He's helping her put on a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can cause harassment and that they may be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You need to be strong in the face of men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or anything else don't make it acceptable!).
The new city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it again under the name Casa Branca, and then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Daru al-Baida, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is not one of the most attractive places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Anyone can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods all over the city, like tagines, pottery, leather goods, shisha, and all sorts of cheap things, but it's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and its location is in the far east, close to Rwanda.
Lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma in 2002, covering most of the city's streets, especially downtown.
Any visits outside Goma must be researched to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, at a time when Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (which is a motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma, and the normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
The area of "Timbuktu" is used metaphorically to refer to strange and distant lands because it's difficult to reach.
Timbuktu is a poor city nowadays, despite its reputation which makes it a tourist attraction, and it even has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
One of Henry Louis Gates's main focuses in the PBS series was on the wonders of the African world.
The city has a significant contradiction compared to the rest of the country's cities, because its character is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, extending parallel to the Mozambique border in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park's area is 19,500 square kilometers, and it's divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It's one of the most attractive areas in South Africa, and is considered one of the best national parks in South Africa.
There are maintenance and entrance fees imposed in the garden, just like all the public gardens in South Africa.
It's beneficial for you to buy a Wild Card, because it allows you to enter a selected group of South African parks, or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is considered a major attraction by many tourists.
The buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline resemble a shimmering graph rising above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonizers used as their own private space, so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 miles) into areas off the coasts of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's part of the forest located in Indian territory within the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests aren't just mangrove swamps; they also contain the last remnants of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges River.
The Sundarbans have an area of 3850 square kilometers, about a third of which is water and swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it currently houses 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses run from the intercity bus station (via the river) all day, although most of them, especially those going to the East and Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
The buses that travel between neighborhoods are completely full, and it's best to buy tickets well in advance, a few days before.
Most areas are served by Coaster buses, which are small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
These shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get around locally, like to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers is 83 meters, their length is 378 meters, and they have two walkways that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, once the Brazilian customs checkpoints are also completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the area we now know as Eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," originated in the 16th century due to the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous population.
The Spanish initiated the colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since Asuncion was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous worldwide for having one of the best polo teams and players in the entire world.
The biggest tournament will be held this year in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Besides that, you can watch the smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
If you want to know news about tournaments and where to buy polo match tickets, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Can I exchange currency at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West store?
You can use British pounds everywhere on the island, and you can also use Stanley credit cards and US dollars often.
On remote islands, credit cards might not be accepted, though British Pounds and US Dollars might be; confirm acceptable payment methods with the owners beforehand.
It's impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you must exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it will be summer there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone, and temperatures often exceed 30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity make it feel much colder than what the thermometer reads.
The amount of rain stays consistent throughout the year, as there aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the zoo are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, and it's not allowed to feed or disturb them.
According to the garden's administration, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from the bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how easy it looks to lure them, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Many visitors get injured every year because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are big and wild, and can even be dangerous, so you have to give them their space.
Also, be careful because the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so don't carry or cook strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was a site for infamous naval clashes in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British warship. About 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the death of leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland lies between two harbors, it has many beaches, the famous ones being located in three regions.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by butucua trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitematā Harbour, in the vicinity of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches get crowded sometimes, with a good selection of shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main popular beer is called "Number One". It's not a complex drink, but it's enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beer is Manta.
French wine has many varieties, but New Zealand and Australian wine might be more widely available.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. Small black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino has a layer of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent, although expensive.
Many trips to the coral reefs happen throughout the year, and it's rare for the reefs to be damaged for any reason.
Even so, seek advice from the authorities, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 17°70. You might also find them sometimes outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles don't usually live in the ocean, but their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler a sense of security that they will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Although you might find other types of accommodation bookings, such as campsites through a travel agent, travel agents usually deal with specific hotels.
The custom is that travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even all-inclusive packages including flights and hotels.
They might hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (like a visa).
Despite that, any modifications or requests should initially be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of people attending music festivals decide to camp on-site and consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
You have to remember that the music on the main stages might be over, but there are sections of the festival that may continue playing music until late at night.
Some festivals include special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea region in winter, you need to check the cabin's location, because traveling over the ice causes very loud noise for the people who are severely affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises usually include a specific amount of time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (double-check the conditions).
Casinos usually put in effort to increase the time and money that guests spend. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and it's also difficult to find exits.
They have a tradition of special meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but intoxication impairs good judgment on things, and all seasoned gamblers know the importance of a gambler staying sober.
If you're driving your car at high altitudes or over mountainous passes, you need to consider the possibility of snow or ice falling, or that temperatures might be below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is weak, and you won't have the same control as when you're driving on smooth asphalt.

If you're not used to driving on rural roads, you need to be careful, because there are always slopes, narrow passages, and very sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than they were in the preceding and following sections — usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and strict adherence to them is more crucial than ignoring them.
But the cell phone service is much stronger here than the service in other parts of the road, like the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they have many diverse benefits, like the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.

Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
And it provides a lot of stability for the rider, but it may entail safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting caught in them.
If the rider falls off the horse but his foot remains stuck in the stirrup, the horse could bolt and drag him. There are some safety precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
At the very beginning, most jockeys wear riding boots that have heels and very soft, narrow soles.
The second thing is that some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the rider's foot to slip out of the stirrup if pulled back, or as soon as the rider falls off.
Valle Cochamo, the first place that comes to mind when talking about climbing in Chile, is known as the Yosemite of South America and has many big walls and granite rock formations.

In good conditions, you'll be able to cover longer distances than walking, but you'll rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on groomed trails.
Europe is a small continent, but it has a lot of independent countries. And in normal circumstances, when you travel and pass through many countries, it means you have to apply for visas and go through passport control many times.
Despite that, the Schengen area functions somewhat as a single country in this regard.
Since you're in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Basically, the cool thing is, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply separately for entry visas for each individual Schengen member state, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
