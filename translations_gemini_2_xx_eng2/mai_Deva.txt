This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already prevalent, but also provides fossil details not typically found before, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal had chestnut-brown feathers on top and yellow or carotenoid-colored feathers on the bottom.
This new information also provides insight into the development of wings in birds.
Because dinosaurs did not have a well-developed shaft in their wings, called a rachis, but had other wing features such as barbs and barbules, researchers estimate that the rachis is a later evolutionary development compared to other features.
The wing structure suggests that they were not all used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage, not the weak feathers of a chick.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was searching for is caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, similarly the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy resides in a kind of halo around the galaxy, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

Candidates may send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, following specific procedures, the votes will be counted by volunteers under heavy supervision.

Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested the five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandrashekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their face covered.
When the car crashed, there were three people inside the house, but none of them were injured.
Actually, the driver sustained a serious head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
He has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of his son's murder.
He is in custody due to pending charges and investigations, but there is a possibility of tampering with eyewitness evidence because his image is widely publicized.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, and the courts viewed the publication of the picture as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University observes, "By publishing pictures and other details of suspects, journalists are treading a dangerous path."
The Crown Office, which is the overall prosecuting authority, indicated to journalists that no further comment would be made until at least the conclusion of the prosecution.
The document, according to the revelation, mentions the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Reportedly, other issues included were the future status of Jerusalem, which is indispensable for both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a ten-year military presence in the valley, while the PA only agrees to such a presence for five years.
The supplementary pest control trial was monitored by the sharpshooters and rangers because the trial was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage with NPWS, the four shooters initially selected for the shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to a nine-member short-term Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to guide the country towards new elections.
The commission held Martelly responsible for the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Violent protests, sometimes occurring, have started due to the failure to hold elections, some since after 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods overheating have been reported, including a total of six that caught fire and four people who suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the Apple report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (Friday at 09:19 PM GMT).
The Marianas' Northern Emergency Management Office said there was no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage in a bus hijacking in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several abducted people have been freed, and so far at least 6 deaths have been confirmed.
Six abductees, including children and the elderly, were quickly released, among whom were Filipino photographers.
Later, an old woman needed to use the restroom, and photographers were sitting in that place. Mendoza was killed.
Following in his father's footsteps, Ligins pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor in his spare time.
Their research shows that if a certain hormone is administered, it will accelerate the maturation of a baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the queen of ECW's peak. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me...maybe even more so...Love her and will miss her...Hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election who oppose Australia becoming a republic, there has been an 8 percent increase since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the people surveyed share the view that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the peak of the survey, 29 percent of the people included in the survey believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but their fitness is in doubt due to complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to relieve his pain because he had been banned from sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people, using various hardware and software, verified the discovery until the beginning of February, and Mars was declared the winner.
Comets were likely a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to learn how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political drivel and stupidity".
It was speculated that she would be in the running for the President's Medal in 2016.
FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and cut carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground-radar-based technology, to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport is being provided, and trains running above ground at Wembley will not stop, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The lack of transportation increased the possibility that the team would be forced to play behind closed doors without supporters.
A study recently published in a science journal reported the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the nine species developed in just two generations, whereas it is believed that this process takes longer due to breeding between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be beaten into tiny sizes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be twisted and folded. It can be marked or wrapped in sheets.
It can be made very thin and can be glued to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical is.
The pH level indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has had its electron(s) removed (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a bowl.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities' homes in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women lived together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite receives a call in space and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A huge rocket taller than 100 feet is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is provide us with very easy and fast transportation.
He brought trains, cars, and many other transportation equipment for us.
They have smaller to medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to deer and deer-like animals.
Finally, how many feral cats (including unowned domestic cats) are there that eat small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds?
The secret to his success is the concept of niches, where each cat has a specific task that prevents it from competing with others.
The lion is the most social cat, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Due to having a large family of sisters and daughters, females are especially closely connected to each other.
Lion prides function much like wolf or dog packs, animals that behave surprisingly like lions (but not other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
A skilled and robust athlete can climb a tiger (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the genus Panthera, which includes lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but is more like a harsh, screeching series of sounds.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they could, they would catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost every animal that ocelots hunt is much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots stalk animals and use their sense of smell to locate (prey) for food when they are on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their nocturnal vision, and can also move very quietly. Ocelots blend in with their surroundings to hunt their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (such as if they go over a mountain range or river, or if they go to a new island so that they cannot easily return), then they especially find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this novel environment with different resources and different competitors, the new population will require different traits or adaptations to become a stronger competitor compared to before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, two populations would look so different that they could no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Trees produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Trees make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our people used to build their houses from trees and make clothes from trees. Most of the food that we eat comes from trees. Without trees, animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it had no fear of anyone except other Mosasaurs.
Its massive jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing that came its way could escape.
I am not certain, but its tongue may have been barbed. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may also have been cannibalistic.
This water seeps in and attacks anything, even if it's a gigantic dinosaur like a T. Rex.
While most of their food might be familiar to us, the Romans also indulged in strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women used to sit on chairs and eat their food, rich people preferred to eat together, with a verandah beside them while they ate.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The people of Babylon built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People used to offer sacrifices to the deities, and priests would try to fulfill the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctum that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The tower's top was a special sanctuary for the deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air.
The women were cooking food in the courtyard; the open storerooms and counters were visible in the street. Stones were used for building houses.
The land of Canaan did not have large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was very sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and during a voyage further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite their search, the Eskimo tribe was already living there for some time.
While every country was, in a way, 'Scandinavian', there were still many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, then you might think that there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Following the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence Dated 4th July 1776" were written. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
However, nobody knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is possible that the notation was simply added as a label.
After the D-Day landings and subsequent battles, the northern part of France became independent, but the southern part was still not liberated.
This "Vichy" was governed by the French. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded southern France, an invasion that was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work together in society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil; it is related to the Latin "civics," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and it defines the size of society to some extent.
It is the precursor of city-states and nations. A civilizational culture means the transmission of knowledge across generations, a slow cultural footprint, and equitable dissemination.
Small cultures disappear without leaving behind sufficient relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy or collect taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it was dependent on state officials to enforce its actions, who were often uncooperative.
He had no authority to abolish tax laws and duties between the states.
Amendments to articles required the consensus of all the states, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, is one of the two most successful teams in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international sports and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to its cluster/group of islands located near Japan, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's beginnings were in the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, it declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which they ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can see what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been repaired, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the nearly dominant film size of the analog film era.
It is also AI generated, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, this format's aspect ratio (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
How many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) have this aspect ratio equal to or approximately estimated?
The rule of thirds, despite its overuse and often derided status, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism by maintaining a sense of order within an image.
This indicates that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersections of lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity had united the European states for over a thousand years.
Its pervasive power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
A major tenet of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many people to question whether this principle of religion was being fulfilled or not.
Immediately following the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law as codified by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering a section of the sea, creating a danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was a limited response to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing sentiment among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations expressed a desire to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents in his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Thomas Edison via Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each phase of China, or each family that was in power, was a distinct dynasty.
It was an unstable era with provinces divided among each dynasty. Among these periods, the most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce battles for the throne among several nobles.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras, with thousands of people killed in the magnificent palaces of Xi'an for the highest seat.
There is a great deal of social and political influence, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, the change to nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Besides this, the revolution opened up businesses for all male applicants, allowing them all to be ambitious and successful.
He is joining the army because army rankings were now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He would often go to a cave known as "Hira," located on the mountain of "Noor" (light), for contemplation.
That cave, which had survived the ravages of time, offers a very vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a peak in the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, it's not easy to find, even if one knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it's a complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clean, beautiful sky above and so many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that still stand today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian valley of the dead, includes the pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper arc" symbol looks like a V, and the "lower arc symbol" looks like a staple or a square with its bottom part missing.
The above means that you should start from the top of the arrow and push the bow, and the bottom means that you should start from the handle of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upper register typically produces a softer sound, while a lower register is stronger and more pronounced.
Feel free to mark your own copy with a pencil, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to go from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
Riding in a carriage, and amidst a crowd shouting against the King and Queen, they arrived in Paris covered in dust.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
Once, a member of the court bowed his head, like a royal guard killed in Versailles before the frightened queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay a large portion of the cost of American colonial rule and to pay interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
There is no doubt that the excessive profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the core profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is a period of European history from the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was the period before the Early Middle Ages and after it was the Late Middle Ages, which traditionally is considered to have ended in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of views, from technology-promoted or technological imperative perspectives to the stricter notion that human destiny is driven by an inherent logic tied to scientific laws and its expression in technology.
Both major interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development follows a pathway largely independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology "impacts" societies that are inherently passive, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, therefore new methods of production have been developed to reduce the cost of buying a car.
Buying vehicles on a large scale leads to many accidents on the road, which necessitates the invention of new technologies in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies and for healthcare.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, taken from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and with time, customs and culture arose in that geographical area, and this society, being adapted to the place, was better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a major center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its status declined, the main reason being that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were less valuable compared to what the Byzantine market offered.
This was the time when the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the early period, this eastern dress culture was heavily influenced by Byzantine.
Due to sluggish communication channels, these styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun developing its own style. As a result of the Crusades, people began using buttons to fasten clothing, which was one of the greatest developments of that time.
Subsistence farming is that type of farming in which enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, primarily organic system, in which indigenous seeds of conserved environmental areas are used for maximum yield along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this continues to be the case in developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar ideologies who feel marginalized by mainstream social norms, and help in the development of identity consciousness.
Members of subcultures may differ from others due to their age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics of subcultures that set them apart can be a combination of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or other factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the use of distinctive stylistic qualities and symbolism, including fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One method used to highlight the importance of socialization is to draw attention to unfortunate cases of children facing neglect, misfortune, deliberate abuse, and lack of socialization by adults during their development.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, children were abandoned by their parents due to severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Animalistic children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Allegations are made against them that they were raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the forest.
When a non-human animal raises a child completely, the feral child's behavior (within physical limitations) almost completely mirrors the behavior of a care-animal, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make education easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolds are not a method of learning but rather a support that assists someone who is learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real; in other words, any teacher is a form of scaffolding, and so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software, and it serves to question, prompt, and explain those processes that students might find challenging to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where there is a lack of nutrition, care, and educational provisions.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe space for these types of children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is expected to fulfill all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The uses and gratifications approach paves the way for additional dimensions through the specific characteristics of the internet.
For example, internet use has been cited as a significant motivator for both "education" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
When visitor feedback on websites was examined, "personal participation" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified by Egghimi and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects.
Video recording has paved the way for important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions and facial movements, which last for only a few milliseconds.
It is often claimed that one can detect if someone is lying by accurately interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech," indicated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to assess truth.
He also suggested that such capacities could be used in animals such as domestic dogs to explain human behavior.
Twentieth-century research has revealed that this genetic variation has two pools: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between two pools with each generation.
In savanna regions, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to meet all their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
In addition to this, there are serious consequences of failing: such as stunted growth, depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily available plant resources, such as leaves and pods, are available, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high amounts of protein, including essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna region do today.
Waking up intentionally during your usual sleep period and going back to sleep after some time (10-60 minutes) is called sleep interruption.
Using a silent alarm clock, you can easily transition to a conscious state without fully waking up.
If you find yourself resetting your clock in your sleep, it can be kept in another part of the house, so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Biorhythm-based other options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, any known diuretic) before sleeping so that the person is forced to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension pervading their body and soul.
The less stress you have, the more positive your life energy will be. Every person has the capacity for ultimate peace and contentment.
Every person can attain enlightenment. The only obstacle between us and this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and several techniques of Yoga from India.
In theory, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Kundalini energy (energy of knowledge) is awakened through Kundalini Yoga with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The Tibetan meditation center is Dev Yoga. Through the vision of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which paved the way for cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the decline of several countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
This was going to last for the next 40 years, and in reality, this conflict was going to be fought by proxy armies from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other battlegrounds.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had already collapsed, and the only remaining hope was to retreat and reorganize with the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, when the Red Army of the Soviet Union, with 800,000 troops, entered the war by invading the eastern territories of Poland after violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral, and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, these plans became obsolete almost overnight.
Using ships for cargo transport to carry people and goods in large quantities across oceans is still the most efficient method.
The traditional role of navies has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
A particularly striking example of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to transport soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
There, the German Navy was mainly trying to stop traffic by using U-boats.
If the Allied nations had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain because it would have had the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated together around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to keep them (animals) for the convenience of obtaining their milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by young shepherds, mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known shepherds. These animal husbandry practices are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the wagonway consisted only of parallel wooden planks, it allowed the horses to gain more speed and pull more weight compared to the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
Cross-ties were started long ago to keep the tracks in place. Slowly, however, it was realized that the track would be more efficient if it had a piece of iron on top.
This has become common, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons considerably.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rail was introduced.
The first known transportation involving walking began with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man) two million years ago, when humans started walking upright.
His predecessor, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start being more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to mitigate future suffering to some extent.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should neutralize it.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological progress of humankind, and problems have increased due to the larger population and the extraordinary lifestyle of humankind.
On July 4th, after being adopted by Congress, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 impressions were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
25 Dunlop broadsides still exist, which are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider it a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
But there are so many things about birds that even today they seem like dinosaurs.
Her feet are like a balance and have claws, she lays eggs, and she walks on her hind two legs like a T-Rex.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded as binary numbers.
In a binary number, there can be only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - for use in the specific terminology of computers.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of open containers of medication or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to a group of insects and similar creatures.
This term comes from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Nidicolous pests and bedbugs are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is in their best interest, or not in the best interest of their child, to raise the child.
These couples may choose to plan for adoption for their children.
In adoption, the birth parents relinquish all parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method truly guides most scientific research.
Although it is not alone, experiment, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more potential hypotheses, questioning and observation also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek dwindled, the West found itself cut off from the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely a response to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain free-running cyclical periods even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the major suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They used two preparations, labeling either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, mutations can have different effects, based on the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germline cells or not.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including trees, animals, and wildlife.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is learning about, photographing, and touring orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave in cars from small towns to go to their workplaces, and other people leave from those workplaces to go to the places they just left.
Everyone is connected in some way to this dynamic transportation shuttle and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this vast carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
You rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers truly incompetent? Or is something else fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within reasonably consistent limits; thus, there is some reasonable stability in traffic flows, and this can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design, and operation of all road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings back against their bodies.
It provides it with a vast network of small places to hide from hunters.
The only insects that couldn't fold their legs were dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
This seems wise, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is rotating, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes becoming six miles wide.
20 percent of all the water that flows from rivers into the oceans on Earth comes from the Amazon.
The length of the major Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction on stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The New Kingdom Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, the ancient Egyptians, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language that is used by most of the people who work in this state, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these could be found in their native form in nature and tunneling was relatively easy with primitive tools.
Aristotle was a philosopher who propounded the theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. Those elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
These substances existed in four states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also theorized that what we see is a newly changed form of matter.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. It should not be forgotten that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. In reality, metals like silver and gold also exist.
You may also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Incredibly, atoms are so small that billions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, when the pencil was produced, it became a good friend to many people.
It is regrettable that as new writing methods have emerged, the status and use of pencils have declined.
People now write messages on computer screens, so they never have to go near a sharpener.
Someone might wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to hold the many protons and neutrons of a nucleus together.
It's like rolling a heavy vehicle down a hill. It's splitting an atom and then releasing some of the energy from it.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can fall apart with little or no external pressure.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust near the property is approximately 70 kilometers and the thickness of the outer crust is approximately 100 kilometers.
It is thinner under the maria (lowlands on the moon) and thicker under the mountainous regions.
The property is thin, so there could be more impact on the nearby flank. It was easy for the lava to rise to the surface.
Prospect theory focuses on discovering what people are attracted to or what appeals to them.
These principles suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories observe about certain people what it is that they want that makes them do what they do, and what things in their environment motivate them to do or not do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. One end of the spectrum involves trying to remain "one of the boys" (or one of the girls).
Managers of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct performance evaluations, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, transforming into an unfamiliar person, one feels they must change everything they are doing and adopt it themselves.
Ultimately, leadership is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior is a result of differences between the leadership and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as points of contact for their immediate physical groups.
Compared to members of traditional teams, they often have more autonomy because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a characteristic component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? Organizational learning has the goal of putting innovative concepts into practice.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ease can be communicated.
As a result, an organization works together to remove process bottlenecks, potentially leading to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership should foster a culture of innovation, along with building shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes it as a method used to help organizations reach high levels of performance with an unconstrained order approach.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence from theoretical perspectives for empirical investigation. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it more precise.
Understanding the relationship between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and can cause changes in certain mental functions.
With the advent of new technology, we have the opportunity to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build continuous systems models, which helps us understand the processes in our own minds.
Although AI has a strong presence in science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to provide customer diagnostics and answer questions, along with handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate subjects, which are focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being incorporated into numerous home computers and video game software applications.
Study trips are a big part of any class. Often a teacher likes to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers solutions with virtual study trips. Students can sit with their class and view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or appreciate beautiful art.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, the website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most important audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Collaborative blogging "compels students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to nurture audience interest motivates students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to internet content, students can define their own position in the context of others' writing and, at the same time, outline their own point of view on particular issues (O'Reilly, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and boasts a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
The far south has Niagara Falls, and the north is home to Moscow's unmatched natural beauty, and even more than that.
These items best showcase Canada to outsiders in Ontario.
In the north, a large area has a very low population and some almost uninhabited forests.
What is surprising to many people, given the population sizes: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is still the largest and a continent in itself.
Most of the small islands are independent nations or are affiliated with France, and are known for luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and they occupied Comoros and Mayotte on a large scale.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, this region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
It is recommended that female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (not just the ones that look very expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences may result in them considering actions like staring and following, holding hands etc. as harassment, while they may not be considered unusual.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand on your own feet (whether there are cultural differences or not, that's not right!).
Casablanca's modern city was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and it was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and only after abandoning it following the 1755 earthquake, it was rebuilt with the name Casa Branca.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Beida and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the following interesting places to shop in throughout Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling a full, wide range of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramic pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and knick-knacks, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma, a tourist city, is located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, and especially the city center area and most of the roads sank underground.
While Goma is safer compared to other cities, it is important to be informed about the ongoing conflicts in the North Kivu province before traveling outside of Goma.
This city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and is home to one of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking experiences in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) for short trips in and around Goma. A typical (local) short ride will cost around ~500 Congolese Francs.
With its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a charming metaphor for a remote land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport nearby.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
This city is completely different from the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arabic influence than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
Who can benefit from purchasing a Wild Card, which provides entry to one or all of South Africa's national parks?
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region, and it is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
Hong Kong's skyline, with its row of buildings, has been compared to a magnificent bar chart, its prominence accentuated by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed along the northern coast on reclaimed land.
This is the place that British colonialists had made their own, and so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
Although the jungle is not just a mangrove swamp - it includes some of the last remaining strongholds of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 sq km, of which about one-third is included in water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japan coaster buses operate, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, and it is 378 meters long with two paths that are 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, eliminating the need for Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group then living in eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous peoples, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born from the encounter of Spanish conquerors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the colonial period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for being one of the world's best polo teams and having some of the best players.
The year's biggest tournament takes place in December at the Las Canitas polo field.
At other times of the year, small tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
For tournament news and to purchase tickets for polo matches, see the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at a value of one to one.
The only bank on the islands where money can be exchanged is located in Stanley, near the FIC South Store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and United States dollars are also widely accepted within Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and United States currency may be taken; check with the owners beforehand to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
Exchanging Falkland currency outside of the islands is nearly impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter weather can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There is no distinct "rainy" or "dry" season: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
It doesn't matter how docile they appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, many dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Besides this, be aware that scent attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid taking or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
Apart from one British cruiser, all ships sank. About 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence movement organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of Paramount Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because of the expansion of Auckland's two ports, there are many beaches here. The most popular beaches are in three regions.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It has safe swimming and almost all sandy beaches, and most have the shade of palm trees.
The Tamaki Drive is on the coast between Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive suburb of Mission Bay, and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They sometimes vacation at crowded family beaches, with various shops along the shore. It's safe to swim in the water there.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines can go the distance better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are wary, it is easy to get bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black 'espresso', a cappuccino with a high mound of cream (not froth), and tea served without milk are common.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Reef trips are conducted throughout the year, and injuries on the reef from any cause are rare during these.
Even then, take advice from the officials, follow all the signs, and pay full attention to the safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found in the north since 1770 from October to April near the sea coasts and river mouths. They can occasionally be found after these times as well.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not actively found in the sea; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives peace of mind to travelers that they will have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents commonly offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the proposal or obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they can also hold the reservation for you.
However, any amendments or requests should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most people attending music festivals decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the main stage has finished its music, there might be parts of the festival that continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camp areas for families with young children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin space, as the noise from passing through ice is very distressing for the most vulnerable.
A visit to St. Petersburg includes a city break. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically make numerous efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to keep track of the outside.
To keep the guests in good spirits and engaged on the premises, they usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment options available.
Some places serve alcoholic beverages at home. However, alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying calm.
Anyone driving to high latitude areas or mountain passes should consider the possibility of frost, snow, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and frosty roads, friction is reduced and you can't drive the same way you would on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Snowfall, blowing snow, or condensation and ice on vehicle windows can also restrict visibility.
On the other hand, in many countries frost and icy conditions are common, and traffic usually continues throughout the year without interruption.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, and an attraction for many visitors.
In popular usage, the word safari refers to an overland journey, especially to see the amazing African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and high-level equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will be able to see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or simply "walking") involves hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, the city that hosted the games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, then it could be a difficult situation for you.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are not extended past the end of March to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will be priced between 2,500 and ¥130,000, with specific tickets costing around 7,000.
Damp clothes can be helped to dry by ironing. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they are not present in the room.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't like wearing pressed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the clothes get too hot (which could cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others, many minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests and insects that they are not familiar with in their home areas.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, cause allergies, spread venom, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people, are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Heavy taxation forces travelers to countries to sometimes save more money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through desolate wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on the country's roads, use your discretion: steep slopes, narrow streets, and sharp turns prevail.
The posted speed limit is much lower than the preceding and following sections – typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to it is particularly important.
Intriguingly, though, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very good, and in Bavaria, like its southern neighbor Austria, it is very rich and diverse.
The pastry of fruits is common, apples are baked in pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair especially well with strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Kari is a dish based on a gravy of herbs and spices, with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of gravy.
