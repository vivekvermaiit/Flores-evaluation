USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the American Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to maintain a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, would be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also gives details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the top with a pale or carotenoid-coloured underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the feathers of the dinosaur do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other characteristics of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development compared to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is the start of a young dinosaur, the example shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the start of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
In a car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, two police officers were killed and more than twenty other people were injured.

She discovered that the sun worked according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system appeared to be driven by their color, their rotation, and nothing else.
The color and revolution are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversals.

The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
It warns that nobody can guarantee that any action plan at this moment in Iraq will ensure the stopping of sectarian warfare, the increase of violence, or the sliding towards chaos.
The report begins with a plea for an open debate and for the achievement of a consensus in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East.
The report is very critical of almost every aspect of the current policy of the executive power for Iraq and urges an immediate change of course.
The first of the 78 recommendations is that before the end of this year, new diplomatic initiatives must be taken to protect the borders of Iraq against hostile interventions and to restore diplomatic ties with neighboring countries.
Current senator and Argentinian First Lady Christina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her presidential candidacy yesterday evening in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius star system.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational force on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter is situated in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small pieces.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he/she said that the new variant was "very problematic and worrying due to the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll thinks that some patients contracted the virus in the hospital and that there were at least two healthcare providers from the hospital involved.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
The percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seemed low, however; 6000 out of a total of 330,000 infected people at any given moment in South Africa.

The government has also promised several million ampoules of the encephalitis vaccine, which will help health authorities prepare for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines this year to the historically hardest-hit areas were delayed due to a lack of funds and the relatively low priority compared to other diseases.

They are cooler during the day than the surrounding surface and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly consistent temperature, but it does correspond with the idea that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glenn Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has always been a low-tech experience: voters simply go into a booth, put a pre-printed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate marked on it into an envelope.
After officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The codification of procedures for French electoral law is relatively strict.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes already inside at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes are added except for those of voters who have been properly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the sitting group of the athletes with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11:60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four skiers in the women's group did not manage to complete their runs there, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to achieve a place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and a mobile phone.
Acting Inspector-General DK Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss tourist and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The suspects are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjer, Ramrpo Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the suspect entered the courtroom with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to translate that sentence. I need more context about the Limburgish language to provide an accurate translation.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the emergency services were getting the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused by Edinburgh Sheriff Court of the murder of her son.
She is in jail awaiting the indictment and the trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be tainted because her image has been widely published in the newspaper.
In other places in the UK this is common, but Scottish justice works differently and courts view the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The public prosecutor's office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has informed journalists that no further comment will be given in any case until the indictment.
The document will, according to the layman, refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants to base on the borders from before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics that are reportedly on the agenda include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years until an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary test with pest control had to be precisely monitored by rangers, because the test was followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a collaborative partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters who were selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It's the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the current CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's reaction to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The often violent protests were caused by the absence of elections, some of which had been planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases have been reported of iPods overheating, which have caused a total of six fires and left four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the machine.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The Ministry called Apple's delay of the bulletin "extremely regrettable".
The earthquake was at 07:19 local time (Friday, 09:19 PM GMT) in Mariana.
Crisis managers from the Northern Marianas have said that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus full of tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16.
A number of kidnapped tourists have been rescued, and it is said that at least six people have died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, just like the Filipino photographer.
The photographer later took the place of an older woman because she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained in midwifery and started working in 1959 at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature births in his spare time.
Their research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black box' flight recorders.
Fellow sausage vendors also offered Luna their support.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman.”
Dustin “Golddust” Runnels remarked that “Luna wasn’t as crazy as I was... Maybe even more... Loved her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place.”
Of the 1400 respondents surveyed prior to the 2010 federal elections, the number of opponents of the Republic of Australia grew by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim prime minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign of the 2010 federal elections that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent felt that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays, but due to her complaints, her condition was doubtful.
He was not able to take the medication needed to overcome the pain because they are banned by Speule.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
At the beginning of February, several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software and announced it this Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of the delivery of water to the Earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets originate, especially how the Earth was formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a law last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political blather and foolishness".
It is thought that he will become president in 2016.
NexGen is a system of which the FAA claims that it would enable airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel annually and reduce CO2 emissions.
It makes use of satellite-based technology, as opposed to the older ground radar-based technology, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with precise information.
There will be no extra transport provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking spaces and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Out of fear of insufficient transport, there was a possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although it was assumed that the process would take much longer due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin threads, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is often used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Litmus changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them with clean, wet hands until it forms a ball.
The moisture on your skin will react with the outermost layers, which will feel strange and form a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in almost every house a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewage systems have been found.
Also in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China there were toilets. In the Roman civilization, toilets were often part of public bathhouses where men and women were in mixed company together.
If someone calls you from thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our vision.
A considerable rocket of more than 100 feet high is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the earth in unbelievable ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, varying from rabbit to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the many numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats; they live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three related adult males, together with up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions behave just like weasels towards or at their prey, animals that surprisingly resemble lions a lot (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very obvious to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but more like a sense of panting, screamed words.
Ocelots generally eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots follow other animals and find them to eat (prey) by smelling, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also behave very secretly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they don't easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations to be a strong competitor than they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
After a period of time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to resemble the other population more and more.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people breathe out (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis, they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothing from plants. Most of the food that we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the most important predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, including an extra set on top in his mouth, which meant there was no escape for anything that came into contact with his bones.
We aren't certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps it was even a cannibal.
Everything that came into the water was fair game, even a huge, ravenous dinosaur like the T. rex would be no match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and another type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich people often held banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not contain any food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had, for example, no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cacao, and not a single ancient Roman had ever tasted a sprout.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was regarded as the house of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called Ziggurats, were built to form part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The largest part of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
Women cooked indoors, shops were open counters that looked out onto the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and then when he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, royal customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written in invisible ink on the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. While there is something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the declaration of independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text was displayed upside down in the document.
While nobody knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
It is therefore likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks' time, the Americans and the Free French troops had liberated southern France and returned to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture that is shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and that somehow also defines the scope of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization culture implies the passing on of knowledge over multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and a fair distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its actions.
It also had no authority to levy tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country on Earth.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan is, Japan is often geographically seen as an "archipelago".
Taiwan already began in the 15th century, where European sailors who passed by noted the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, which initiated a transformation in the production practices of native grains and employed Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops from the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) take control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declare Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what it originally looked like there.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
The most used format for still images in the world is, for example, 35 mm, the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced, but what is even more important, the aspect ratio has been adopted by the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would therefore be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, an APS family of formats) are equal to or approximate this aspect ratio.
The often misused and frequently ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while still maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under fire.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together, despite differences in language and customs.
His all-pervasive power touched everyone, from king to ordinary person.
One of the most important doctrines of the church is that having a lot of money should be used to reduce deprivation and poverty, and that the church's money is precisely for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and due to that concentration of power and money, many people began to wonder if they really meant what they said.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective and cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade was in violation of generally accepted international law codified by various international laws.
Great Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a poetry collection, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different time periods; each phase of China or each family that was in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best-known of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, heavy warfare took place between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the flourishing periods in the history of ancient China, while thousands of people died battling to sit on the highest throne in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the land belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful men to succeed.
The same applied to the army, because instead of the military rank list being based on class, it was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that went beyond this everyday life. He visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the times, gives a very vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once in the cave, it's total isolation.
There is nothing else to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. From the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures that were built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian valley of the dead, contains several pyramids (of which the largest pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the women and family members of Khufu.
The “upward bow” symbol looks like a V and the “downward bow” symbol is a staple or a square with the bottom missing.
Upbow means that you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and downbow means that you have to start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward bow usually generates a softer sound, while a downward bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the printed articulation marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The deathly afraid King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the sister of the king, Mrs. Elizabeth, were driven back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage they traveled back to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and threatened the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to widely open the route of their carriage.
At a certain moment, a member of the crowd waved with the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and the interest on bonds that were traded in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Naturally, the excess profits arising from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would form the basic profit of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by agreement, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses many different ideas, from technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict view that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic that is related to scientific laws and which manifest themselves in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that falls outside the influence of culture and politics, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
So you could say that a car always leads to more jobs.
But, driving through the country isn't economically sustainable for a few cars, therefore new ways of making (things) have to be invented to make owning a car cheaper.
Many cars also cause more accidents on the road, and that leads to the invention of new techniques in hospitals to repair broken bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, originating from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture arose that were related to that geography, and these were, in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was seen as the capital of the courage of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD, and lasted until about 1100 AD.
People looked up to him less in the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts and relics, which were valued more highly than what they had acquired in Byzantium.
In that time, the name of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often biological system that uses stored seeds originating from the ecoregion, using crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were occupied with subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together who feel neglected by societal norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that distinctively define a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and argot.
One of the most frequently used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw from the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called melancholic or wild. Some wild children were locked up by people (often their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Neglected children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
If the abandoned child has been raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limitations) that almost completely resembles that of the specific caregiver animal, such as fear of or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should make things easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool that offers support to people who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold, but that also applies to the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and is intended to question, stimulate, and explain procedures that might have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to offer safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they came from earlier.
The internet combines aspects of mass communication and also communication between people.
The precise characteristics of the Internet create extra dimensions when it comes to the "uses and gratifications" approach.
Such reasons as "learning" and "socializing" were presented as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal camaraderie and "lasting relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivation when they researched people's reactions to website audiences.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He thinks that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals such as domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two poles of genetic change: hidden and emerged.
Mutations now add genetic variation and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shift variation back and forth between the two poles with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with intestines like those of humans to obtain enough amino acids with the available plant-based resources.
Besides that, neglecting it has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible, affordable, and readily available sources of protein would be those available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
That's because animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides high-quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of deliberately waking up during your usual sleep period and falling asleep again a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness, without fully waking you up.
If you notice that you are repeatedly setting the alarm clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of your room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, which forces someone to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in body and mind.
The lower the suffering, the more positive the present life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is realized.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes and culture led to the countries falling apart.
But two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last the coming 40 years and would really be fought out, by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize near the Romanian border.
However, these plans became almost instantly outdated when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created [something] after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of navies was traditionally to ensure that your country retains the ability to transport your people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the capacity of your enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily with U-boats, was busy stopping this trade.
If the allies had failed, then Germany would probably have conquered Britain as well, just like the other parts of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to keep old breeds and tribes for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that grazed over the hills or other areas. They were accompanied by a shepherd, who was often children or young people, such as the well-known shepherd. This way of shepherding is still used.
Railways were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Although this road only consisted of parallel wooden planks, horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the dirt roads of that time.
Crossbeams were introduced very early on to keep the track in place. Over time, it became clear that the track would be more efficient if the beam were covered with iron.
This became the custom, but the iron caused much more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the completely iron wheels became known.
The earliest known form of transport was walking. Humans began to walk upright with the arrival of Homo Erectus (which literally means "upright man"), two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have already been walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We should be able to live more friendly with the environment. We could join the nature association and we could go protest to reduce suffering in the future.
This could be just symptom control in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we should investigate and solve the problems to the bottom.
It is clear enough that the world has changed a lot due to the technological and scientific progress of mankind. Problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of some people.
After it was accepted by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few streets further to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6. He presented it to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists currently believe that a group of dinosaurs still live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
Many things about birds are reminiscent of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T. rex.
Practically all computers nowadays are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have two values: 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Poisoning is not always immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are so common that an easy diagnosis cannot be made.
The clearest indication of poisoning would be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
The name beetle is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This name comes directly from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects well-adapted to parasitize humans.
Mites and bedbugs want to stay in their nest for a long time, and are adapted to living in the nests or house of their host.
Across the entire United States, approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the largest neurological disease among young and older adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. This consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women get MS twice as often as men.
A couple might decide that it would be better for them and for the child if they didn't raise children.
These couples could choose to give up their child for adoption.
With adoption, the biological parents give up their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
But not only that, also the execution of experiments is used to test hypotheses. In addition, questions are asked and observations are made to guide science.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific and psychological insights were accepted.
When children of the Greek language were lost, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific origins.
Many observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often dependent on endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Recurring rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that continue to run even without external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important to demonstrate that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to place their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments where they either labeled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many effects depending on how important the piece of DNA is, the type of mutation, and whether they are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can kill cells or lead to cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wild animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans on Borneo.
Every morning, many people leave the village in cars to go to work, and are passed by other people who are on their way to where they just left from.
Everyone in that dynamic transport system is connected to, and supported by, their own cars in one way or another.
Science now assumes that this carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses public transport. Almost everyone benefits from public transport.
In developed countries, you almost never hear so much complaining about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems lead to so much frustration; why do they fail every day again? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave with a certain predictability; therefore, traffic flows can be represented reasonably consistently with mathematical models.
To give traffic flow again, relationships between three quantities must be established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of the road network.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. Their ability to fly has helped them to evade enemies and to find food and partners more easily.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings backwards over their body.
This gives them more hiding opportunities to squeeze into small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are mayflies and dragonflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus, saw that the planets revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people thought the opposite: that the sun revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems logical, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, or does it?
The Amazon river is the second longest and largest river on Earth. More than eight times as much water flows through it as through the largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes up to 6 km wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and their technical ingenuity.
The inhabitants of the new kingdom in ancient Egypt admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were already thousands of years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian for its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language spoken by most employees in the state, although Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the existence of simple chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these can be discovered in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, came up with the idea that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was actually more than the four states of matter (respectively): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. He also conceived that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply said just a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
You can also have alloys that also contain small amounts of non-metals like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions could fit at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing were invented, the pencil has fallen to an ever lower status.
People now write messages on computer screens, and they never have to come near a grindstone again.
What would happen to the keyboard when something new comes along?
The fission bomb works on the principle that it costs energy to create a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Approximately like pushing a heavy cart up a mountain. The splitting of the nucleus then releases some of the energy again.
Some atoms do not have stable nuclei, which means that they decay more easily with little to no effort.
The moon's surface consists of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There might be more embers on the clear side because the choir was thinner. It was easier for the lava to come to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates people or appeals to them.
These theories state that some people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized as they grew up.
These theories look at why certain people want certain things and what in their environment causes them to do some things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor theory.
Generally, there are two behaviors that can occur when one of the team starts leading the rest. One side of the spectrum is trying to remain one of the group.
These leaders have trouble making difficult decisions such as: imposing punishments, evaluating performances, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, you change into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has done to make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in alienation between leaders and the rest of the team.
Online teams are subjected to the same requirements as regular teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Online teams often function as a point of contact for the group that is close to them.
They often have more autonomy than conventional teammates because there are different time zones which are not understood by the local management.
The presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "Invisible team" is the management that every member has to report to. The invisible team sets the standard for every member.
Why would an organization want to spend so much time on the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One goal of translating learning and organizing concepts into practice is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively by all departments of the organization, then creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
With that, the collaboration process of the organization can overcome an obstacle, leading to new innovation to serve the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of sharing knowledge and organizational development.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that can be used to make organizations perform better.
Neurobiological data has provided a lot of evidence for a new theoretical approach in the study of cognition. As a result, the research area has become much smaller and more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for quite some time that various brain damages, traumas, lesions, and tumors can influence behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies enables us to study brain structures and processes like never before.
This gives us a lot of information with material to build simulation models that can help us understand processes of the mind.
Although AI evokes a strong sense of science fiction, it is an important part of computer science. It deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptations in a machine.
Research into AI has to do with automating tasks that require knowledge.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to help customers with questions and also the recognition of handwriting, voices and faces.
These have become separate disciplines and focus on finding solutions for problems in real-life situations.
The AI system is currently often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but is also applied in various home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are available for rent at every classroom. However, teachers often want to take students to places where no bus goes.
Technology offers a solution with virtual trips. Students can look at museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Sharing an online excursion is a good way to reflect on an excursion and share all the experiences with future classes.
For example, every student from Bennet School in North Carolina designs a website about their excursion to the state's capital. Each year, the website is updated, but old versions are kept online as reference material.
Blogs can also help with improving the writing skills of students. Although students often start with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts writing better to avoid criticism.
It also forces blogging to be less naive about the world. The need to be interesting to the public inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that leads to collaboration and motivates students to learn even outside of school hours.
Proper use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively participating in internet discussions, students can define their positions in relation to other pieces and also give their own perspectives on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and has many galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
We in the south see the Niagara Falls and the north is home to the natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario what foreigners see as typically Canadian.
Vast areas more to the north are not densely populated, and part of it is practically uninhabited.
A comparison that surprises many people is that more African Americans live in the US than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in fact a continent in itself when it comes to the wild nature.
Most of the small islands are independent countries or associate with France. They are known as luxury beach destinations.
The Arabs brought Islam to the lands, and that is currently very important in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route around the Cape to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that you say you are married, regardless of whether that is actually the case.
It can also help to wear a ring (but not one that looks too flashy).
Women need to realize that there are many cultural differences, which can lead to boundary-crossing experiences, and it is not uncommon to be grabbed by the arm or followed, etc.
You must be clear in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
The new city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as an important port called Anfa.
The Portuguese ravaged it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branco, only to abandon the city again after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish traders gave it the name Casablanca again when they established trading posts there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina it's easy to find stalls to buy traditional things like tagines, earthenware, leather products, hookahs and a whole spectrum of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city lies completely in the east, right next to Rwanda.
In 2002, an eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed the city of Goma. The lava covered the largest part of the city, especially the city center.
Goma is reasonably safe, but as soon as you want to leave the city, you have to see what the situation is with the unrest in North Kivu.
The city is also a base for climbs of the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla safaris in Africa.
To explore Goma, you can use a boda-boda (bicycle taxi). This normally (locally) costs around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for distant exotic lands.
Meanwhile, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage monuments in danger due to the desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates’ PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in sharp contrast with the other cities of the country because it has much more Arabic flair than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, all optimal for different types of nature.
It is one of the biggest attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African parks (SANParks).
As with all African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which also provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and it is the place that many people see as the most important destination.
The parade of buildings resembling the Hong Kong skyline looks like a brilliant bar graph, made even clearer by the presence of the water of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
Most residents of Hong Kong's urban development live densely packed on reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists had seized for themselves, and so if you're looking for the colonial past, then this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest literal mangrove in the world, and they stretch 80 km (50 mi) into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland of the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just ordinary mangrove swamps, but they contain some of the last mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges delta.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a safe place for nature. Estimates say that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day. But mostly, especially for those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, they leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because the regional buses are usually full, it's a good idea to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing taxis is a fast and comfortable way to travel to places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully usable in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs post is expected to be finished.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that lived in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco area was the home base of other tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived from hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, previously called "the great province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the original groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournament and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outermost islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, however British and American money may be accepted; check in advance with the owner to determine what an acceptable method of payment is.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so do that before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30 are very normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the animals are nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
However docile they may appear, bison, elk, wapiti, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so stay out of their territory.
Besides, be aware that smells attract bears, do not carry or cook fragrant food, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a notorious maritime impasse when seven ships from Prussia, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 American and Prussian lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the murder of the paramount chief Tapua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is located at two harbors. The most well-known are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the area of North Harbour) lie on the Pacific Ocean and run all the way from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all beaches with sand where you can safely swim, and they almost all have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive lie on Waitemata Harbour, in the chic boating neighborhoods Mission Bay and St Heliers in the middle of Auckland.
There are sometimes family beaches with many people and a good selection of shops along the water. You can swim safely there.
The most important local beer is ‘Number One’. It’s not a complex beer, it’s just pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines available, but the New Zealand and Australian ones might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
Australians find the idea of 'flat white' coffee strange. A short black is 'espresso', cappuccino comes piled high with cream (no milk foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are pricey, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made year-round, and injuries there are rare on the reef.
Always take advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay careful attention to all safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of this period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their most important habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that they have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may also be possible to book other accommodations, such as campsites, through the travel agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include lunch, transport to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also reserve it for you if you need time to think about the offer or to provide other documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must, however, first be submitted through the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on the grounds, and most visitors consider that an indispensable part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that once the music on the main stages is finished, there will still be places at the festival where music will be played until late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the hut, because ice movement causes terrible noises for them, who are most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers do not need visas (check the conditions).
Casinos try to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible, and clocks are often absent, and exits are difficult to find.
They often have special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and on the premises.
Some occasions have free drinks. But if you've had a bit to drink, you can't judge properly anymore, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at higher altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, it is very slippery, and you can't drive as you would on dry asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility can also be very poor due to falling or blowing snow, or due to condensation or ice on the windows.
On the other side, ice and snow conditions are simply common in many countries, and traffic usually doesn't suffer throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is usually used to refer to foreign trips where the magnificent African nature is viewed, especially on the savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and standard equipment ensures good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and panthers are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", or going "footing") consists of a trek of a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have organized two summer games, because it also held them in 1964.
If you had booked your ticket and accommodation for the 2020 exhibition before it was announced to be cancelled, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies are not valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are held.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average price of around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and board to rent even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or you'd rather not wear ironed socks, then you could use a hairdryer, if they have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (otherwise it could shrink, or worse, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas it's enough to boil the water for one minute, in others you definitely need a few minutes.
Not all filters are equally effective, and if you are worried, you should consider buying bottled water from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter unexpected things that they are not familiar with from home.
Unfiltered can spoil food, cause irritation, or even trigger an allergic reaction, be poisonous or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure people with physical force are usually not considered vermin.
Duty free shops are an opportunity to buy goods without taxes and excise duties in some places.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway. You often pass through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on dirt roads, then pay attention: steep slopes, narrow sections and sharp bends are often encountered.
Maximum speeds are visibly lower than on previous and subsequent sections - averaging approximately 35-40 (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Oddly enough, mobile service is currently much better here than on other parts of the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, richly filled and varied, comparable to those of their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pies are very common, for example apples are used all year round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The popular pancakes go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you like small but delicious pastries, then try something called Berliner, pfannkuchen or krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish with herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on how much moisture it contains.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is frequently used in curries. In South India and some coastal areas, coconut milk is more common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term for a gigantic variety of regional cuisines that you can find throughout the country.
However, without clarification, "ete" usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread across the archipelago, has a few simple dishes. The most common flavors that Javanese people love are peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a few aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give more stability for the rider but can also be dangerous if the rider gets stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with their foot stuck in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse bolts. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a stiff, narrow sole.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English ones, have a safety bar which ensures that the stirrups fall off the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a fallen rider.
The Cocamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a large variety of granite walls and cliffs.
The summit often offers a magnificent view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly searching for new routes in the endless possibilities of the walls.
Downhill snow sports like skiing and snowboarding are popular sports. You have to slide down the snow-covered terrain with skis or a board on your feet.
Skiing as an activity is a very big travel destination. Usually the vacation is spent in places where you can ski all the time.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings already show skiers from 5000 years before Christ.
Downhill skiing as a sport has existed since the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski association was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It has to do with, but is not the same as alpine skiing, or mountaineering; the latter is done on steep terrain and you need much stiffer skis and boots.
You can view the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
With this bike, you can cover a larger distance than on foot - but you also won't often reach the same speed as with cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed slopes.
Europe is a small continent with many sovereign countries. Usually, travelling through many countries means that you have to go through many visa applications and passport controls.
But the Schengen zone works roughly as if it were one country in that regard.
As long as you are in this zone, you can cross the border here without passport control all the time.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each individual country in the Schengen zone, which saves time, money and administration.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antique manufactured goods. Some appraisal companies define goods older than 100 years as antique.
The definition has geographical variations, where the lowest age is lower in the US compared to in Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antique, even though they are younger than mass-produced products.
The herding of reindeer is an important means of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is important for many other people with other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami kept reindeer; some lived from fishing and hunting and primarily had reindeer as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sami are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the area of the Sami.
The word "Gypsy" is used a lot, especially among non-Romani people, but it is actually considered offensive because it has a negative connotation with stereotypes and false perceptions of the Romani.
If the country you are traveling to receives a negative travel advisory, that may have consequences for your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can also ask advice from the government of other countries, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
One example is that Americans in the Middle East are in a different situation than Europeans and Arabs.
Travel advisories are only a brief description of the political situation in a country.
Opinions are usually fleeting, general, and simplified compared to the information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any type of weather that can potentially be dangerous, with a chance of damage, social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere on Earth, and there are different types of it, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms of severe weather, just like thunderstorms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal influences can show severe weather phenomena such as snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to pay attention to the risks of severe weather in the area where they are going.
Anyone planning a visit to a country where there could be a risk of war should receive professional training.
Searching the internet for "hostile environment course" would probably give you the address of a local company.
The course will cover all the topics that have come up, but in much more detail, and with practical experience.
A course usually lasts about 2-5 days and mostly involves a role-playing game, a lot of first aid, and some weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about war zones are rarer.
Travelers who want to undergo a gender reassignment surgery abroad must have the correct documents with them for the return journey.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports with the sex indicated as (X), or to adapt documents to adopt the desired name and sex, varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to honor these documents varies just as much.
Customs controls have become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through the scanners with intact privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are recurring currents of waves that break on the beach, often on a reef or something like that.
Due to the underwater topology, the water flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a strong current towards deep water can form there.
Most deaths happen because of exhaustion, caused by trying to swim back against the current, which is impossible.
When you are completely out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to focus on where you won't get caught again, depending on your strength, or wait until you are seen, and wait for rescue.
If you come back, the blow will land sooner than if you leave (because then everything is still exciting). Also, this blow will last longer, and it may hit harder.
Travelers who easily adapted to their new culture sometimes found it very difficult to readjust to their old culture.
If you have lived abroad and come back, you have adapted to the new culture, and you have lost some of your old habits.
When they went abroad, people initially probably had understanding and patience, because they knew that immigrants have to adapt.
What people might not imagine is that travelers who are returning home also need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the coolest things around for the kids.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is just like an audiobook.
The sphinx is used as the backdrop of a long story and is also the narrator.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the other pyramids are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded crater lake of the still active volcano forms a beautiful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula come together here in a plateau, and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, intersected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, where the Vinson Massif peaks with Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without mobile network, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is normally not a replacement for a cell phone, because you need to be outside with a direct line of sight to the satellite to be able to make calls.
The Iridium network is often used for shipping, including recreational boating, and also by expeditions that need remote data and voice capabilities.
Your local telephone provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
A gap year is an increasingly popular option for people who want to travel and learn.
That is especially the case for recent graduates because they can then take a year off without it having a major effect on their academic progress.
In many cases, taking a gap year can increase your chances of being accepted for further study at home.
Usually, you have to pay tuition fees to be accepted into these study programs.
Finland is a wonderful place to go boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos on the coast.
In the archipelagos and seas, you don't necessarily need a boat.
Although the archipelagos on the sea and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for all yachts, a small boat or even a kayak provides a different experience.
Sauna is in Finland something everyone does, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
Only Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand can do that too, but besides that, you see it very little (in Holland the figure is, for example, one in fifty).
Most Baltic cruises have an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can see a lot of the historical city for a few days while sleeping on the ship at night.
If you go ashore alone on the shipboard excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin in the brochures. But, of course, Berlin is not on the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be very daunting for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
That's absolutely nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different than other personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
For some, it can help to know how airplanes work and what happens during the flight to overcome their fear if it was based on the unknown or not being in control.
Courier services are well paid to deliver things quickly. Time is often very important for trade documents, merchandise, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If things are shipped with cargo flights, it can take days before everything is unloaded and through customs.
The only way to get it shipped faster is to check it in as baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to do that without a person. And that's where you're needed.
The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to put down a hefty pile of money (or even better, have your company do it for you).
But there is a price tag attached to that. Normally you pay for business class up to four times as much as the regular price, and for first class eleven times as much!
For direct flights, it usually makes no sense to even look for discounts on seats in first class or business class.
Airlines know that there is a fixed group of people who are happy to pay a pretty penny to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably. And they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also understood.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic and has suffered greatly from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, a conflict led to the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member.
Trade has been restored between the two parts of Moldova despite the political negotiations having failed.
The largest religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and it is a major transportation hub.
From the historical city of Smyrna, now modern, developed with a busy commercial centre, around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, built with glass facades and modern shopping centers, are covered by roofs with red tiles. However, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches give the city more of a Mediterranean impression than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík has a magnificent view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On the cemetery, there are interesting marble statues of doves over a few graves.
It's worth the effort to walk through the intriguing village for half an hour.
Heading north and nearby lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron wrote a passionate account of its splendor.
Scotturb Bus 403 goes regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north lies the shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, where world-famous Marian apparitions have taken place.
Please remember that you are practically standing on a mass grave. This is a place that has incredibly much significance for very many people all over the world.
There are still many men and women who lived through their time here, and many more who had family and friends who were murdered here or worked to death, Jews and others alike.
Please treat this place with dignity, solemnity, and the respect it deserves. Make no jokes about the holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site with markings or graffiti on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Spanish and Catalan. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understands it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
Even though most signs are in Catalan because the law states that it is the first official language.
but Spanish is used everywhere in public transport and also at other facilities.
The announcements in the metro are in Catalan, but unexpected circumstances are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have the reputation of being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Usually, this is just a stereotype, but it's still a good idea to behave well, as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). That will make it easier to find your way.
The aloofness of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show just a little bit of politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beeches, spruces, and firs. The climate is a mix of alpine and Mediterranean.
The variation in plant growth is large due to the diverse microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
The area also has an extreme variation in animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, golden eagle, owl, lynx and wildcat can be found here, in addition to many other species.
If you visit women's monasteries, you must cover your knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries have scarves for women who don't have one, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Even the moon has to wear long pants to cover her knees.
These can also be borrowed at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after every visitor, so you might not feel comfortable using this option.
Majorcan cuisine, just like comparable regions by the Mediterranean Sea, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and it uses olive oil everywhere.
A popular simple dish, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and other available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, except for the word "Sie" (you) for "diech" (you), are written with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.
That is definitely necessary to be able to see the difference between some verbs and the subject.
It also ensures that reading becomes much easier, but writing becomes a bit more difficult because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in the substantivized form.
The pronunciation is quite easy in Italian because most words sound exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are the c and g because the pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Also pay attention to the difference in pronunciation between r and rr: caro means dear, and carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar introduction could help to learn Persian grammar and to understand the sentences better.
I don't need to say that if you know a Romance language, it's easier to learn Portuguese.
Even though some Spanish speakers might be tempted to conclude that Portuguese is so similar to Spanish that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Observatories are usually not suitable for modern research and are often used as museums or educational institutions.
Light pollution wasn't as big of a problem in the past as it is today. They were usually built in cities or on campuses and were easier to reach than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are located in gigantic complexes in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where they had chosen plum blossoms as the flowers to enjoy.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor, solely for himself and the other members of the aristocracy of the imperial court.
Plants thrive best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to pick "just one" and take it with you.
Even if you are visiting a poorly maintained garden, you cannot go and pick plants; if you do that, you will be thrown out without pardon.
Singapore is generally very safe, and you can't get lost there. You can buy almost everything you need there.
But because it's in the tropics, only a few degrees above the equator, you always have to take into account that you'll have to deal with heat and, if it's cloudless (not that often), with strong sun.
A few buses also go north, to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Biblical forefathers Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check beforehand that the bus actually goes into Hebron and not just to the Jewish city of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a nice theme to organize the holiday around.
You could, for example, visit chateaux in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or you could go sailing on the Erie Canal.
They can also find routes with popular hiking or cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity. Then, the birthday of Christ is celebrated.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holidays have also been adopted by people who are not Christian in Christian countries, and in non-Christian countries around the world.
It is a tradition to hold a night vigil in an open place to be able to see the sunrise.
For this tradition, there are of course Christian theological explanations, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches adhere to the Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, where people begin celebrating the resurrection of Christ at 12 o'clock at night.
All the animals that originally lived on the island got there by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Because the distance from the continent is so great, mammals were unable to make the journey, which ensured that the most important grazing animal is the giant tortoise.
Since humans arrived on the islands, many animals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit either the North or South Pole during the winter, then you will be able to experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon all day long.
That is also a good chance to see the Northern Lights because the sky is almost completely dark for 24 hours.
The area is very sparsely populated, and light pollution is usually not a problem, so you can also enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what many Western people are used to.
Suits are the normal business outfit, and colleagues address each other by their last name or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is super important, with a strong emphasis on group effort instead of individual achievements.
Employees usually need to get approval from their supervisor for all decisions they make. They are expected to always follow instructions from their supervisor, without question.
