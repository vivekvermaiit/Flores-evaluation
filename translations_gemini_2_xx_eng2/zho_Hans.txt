The USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee and accepts the Olympic movement's strict requirement to create a safe training environment for all athletes.
We agree with the US Olympic Committee's statement that continuing to promote meaningful change within our organization, rather than revoking licenses, may be more beneficial to protecting the interests of athletes and clubs and their sports.
According to an independent investigation backed by the USA Gymnastics, we may be able to learn why Larry Nassar's widespread sexual abuse, bravely exposed by survivors, went undetected for so long. Furthermore, the association stated that it would make necessary and appropriate rectifications.
The U.S. Gymnastics Federation and the U.S. Olympic Committee share a common goal: to ensure the safety of gymnastics and other sports as much as possible, allowing athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and supportive environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers—a theory that was already widely circulated—but also provides details that fossils typically cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal has chestnut-brown feathers on top and light or carrot-colored feathers on the bottom.
This discovery also helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers in depth.
Dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed central shaft—known as the "rachis"—but they did possess other feather characteristics, such as barbs and barbules. Researchers infer that the evolution of the rachis may have occurred later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates they were not for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers believe that although it is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows mature plumage, not the feathers of a juvenile.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not downy fluff of a hatchling.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb explosion occurred at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, resulting in the death of two police officers and injuries to more than 20 people.

Most of the work completed was theoretical, but the purpose of writing the program is to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for may be caused by tidal forces between galactic dark matter and Milky Way dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
The theory posits that most of the dark matter around a galaxy exists in a kind of halo surrounding the galaxy, composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered this extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
He stated in an interview that the new variant is "very disturbing and concerning because its fatality rate is very high."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the bacteria in the hospital, and at least two of the patients are hospital healthcare workers.
Within a year, one infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the proportion of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis within the overall tuberculosis patient population appears to remain low; in South Africa, only 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 are infected at any given time.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters enter a booth and put a pre-printed paper slip bearing the name of their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verified the voter's identity, the voter placed the envelope into the ballot box and signed the voter registry.
French electoral law establishes fairly strict regulations for the election process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside the box at the start of voting and that no one other than eligible voters who have been counted in a timely manner places envelopes into the box.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every aspect of the election process on-site. In the evening, volunteers count the ballots under strict supervision and according to a specific procedure.

Uka's weapon malfunctioned while pointed at the fifth person's head. Schneider was in agonizing pain, blind in one eye, with a missing piece of his skull, his face reconstructed with titanium plates.
Schneider testified via video link from a US Air Force (USAF) base in his home country.
Besides the Wednesday match, Carpanedo also participated in two individual competitions in the tournament.
Her first event was obstacle skiing, and she finished the first round with a "Did Not Finish" (DNF). 36 out of 116 participants in the competition received the same result.
Her other competition was the giant slalom, where she finished tenth in the women's standing group with a total time of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place Austrian athlete Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place Hungarian athlete Gyongyi Dani.
In the women's sit-ski category, four skiers failed to finish the race, and in the Giant Slalom, 45 out of 117 athletes failed to make the leaderboard.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Additional Director General of Police D K Arya said, "We have arrested 5 people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants' names are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants all wore masks to cover their faces when they appeared in court.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured in the end.
However, the driver sustained a severe head injury.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed, and emergency rescuers extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was sent to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Afterwards, Adekoya was charged with the murder of her son and tried at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is being detained, awaiting indictment and trial; however, any eyewitness testimony could be negatively impacted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's legal system is different, and the court believes that publishing the photos could cause potential harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out: "If journalists publish information such as photos of suspects, there does indeed seem to be a risk."
The main department responsible for the prosecution, the Crown Prosecution Service, told reporters that it would not be making any further statements, at least until the indictment was filed.
It is revealed that the document will mention the border dispute, with Palestine hoping to base it on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Reportedly, other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel is demanding a ten-year military presence in the valley after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority is only agreeing to a five-year presence.
Forest rangers will closely monitor the shooters participating in the supplementary pest control trial, as the trial will be monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a collaboration between the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), the SSAA recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
Acting Director Mick O'flynn of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Protection and Heritage Management Division in New South Wales, Australia, stated that all four shooters selected to participate in the first shooting operation have received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth time in four years being selected for Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended the resignation of the former CEO as part of a push to move the country toward new elections.
The committee is Martelly's response to massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protests have been triggered by some elections failing to be held on schedule, and have sometimes escalated into violence.
Reports indicate approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions and overheating, resulting in 6 fires and 4 minor burn injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they have noted 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported another 34 overheating incidents to the ministry, although the company said these incidents were "not serious."
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry responded that Apple's delay in publishing the report was "extremely regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management said that no disaster losses have been reported domestically.
Moreover, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that no tsunami迹象 had been detected.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a tourist bus in the capital Manila, taking Hong Kong tourists on board as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza raised his M16 rifle and opened fire on the tourists.
Multiple hostages were rescued, but at least six hostages are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographer were released early.
The two photographers then replaced an old woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was then shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his career as a doctor.
He received training as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching prematurity in his spare time.
His research shows that hormone administration can accelerate the maturation of fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also mourned Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Empress, my first manager. Luna passed away on a double moon night. A night like that was as special as she was. She was a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels (aka "Goldust") commented: "Luna was as unpredictable as me...maybe even more so...I loved her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted before the 2010 federal election, and the number of respondents opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
34% of respondents agreed that they hoped Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia's last monarch.
The voting shows a polarized situation: 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his health status has been under question.
He has been unable to relieve the pain with medication because the competition prohibits participants from taking such drugs.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
In early February, several people verified this finding using different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, organic matter that could form proteins and sustain the existence of life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed since a comet collided with Earth a long time ago, especially how Earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, became governor at the beginning of this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political drivel and foolish behavior."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA says NextGen can allow aircraft to fly more direct routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of outdated ground-based radar technology, enabling air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional transportation options, the overground train doesn't stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks or park-and-ride facilities either.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the competition may be forced to proceed behind closed doors without team supporters.
On Thursday, a study published in the journal Science reported that a new species of bird has formed in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that this new species evolved in just two generations due to breeding between the local Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, and the introduced cactus finch, even though the process was thought to take longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be curled into minuscule forms.
It can be drawn into fine threads for twisting and braiding. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals, and because it is so thin, it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color of cabbage juice will change depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substances.
pH values are expressed by the quantity of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being measured.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then use clean, damp hands to knead them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, forming a shell-like substance, which feels quite interesting.
In both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every household had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in Minoan city houses on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of mixed-gender public bathhouses.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you will use satellites.
Upon receiving the phone call, the satellite in space reflected it back almost immediately.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts certain light rays and visibility.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket over 100 feet tall.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The wheel's greatest contribution to us is making our transportation more convenient.
Thanks to it, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized felines, which eat medium-sized prey, consuming everything from rabbits and antelope to deer.
Ultimately, numerous small cat species (including free-ranging pet cats) prey on far more abundant small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is a niche concept, with each cat responsible for a specific job, preventing them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the cat species, living in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions consists of one to three related adult males, and up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in a large family, females are usually closely related to each other.
The behavior of lion prides is very similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs. These animals behave surprisingly similarly to lions (but differently from other big cats), and these behaviors are highly lethal to their prey.
Tigers are all-around athletes; they can climb (though not very well), swim, and long jump, and their pulling power can reach five times that of a human strongman.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera). These four big cats are the only felines that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as deep as a lion's roar, but more like an angry, hoarse shout.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. If conditions permit, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of leopard cats' prey are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by using their sense of smell and sniffing out the scent trails of prey on the ground.
They have strong night vision, allowing them to see clearly in the dark, and they are also very stealthy. Leopard cats hunt by first blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from their original main population (for example, when they cross mountains and rivers, or when they arrive on a new island making it impossible to easily return), they usually find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a strong competitor, rather than those they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need to adapt to the environment just as they did before.
As time passed, the new populations began to adapt to the new environment, and they started to become increasingly dissimilar from other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will eventually look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which is the formation of new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a crucial link in the evolutionary process.
Plants can produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses, and we use plants to make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, fearing nothing but its own kind.
Its elongated lower jaw is lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, with another row on its upper jaw. This means anything that encounters it has no escape.
Its tongue may be forked, although we are not certain. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even eat humans.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus Rex are no match for it.
Although much of the Romans' food is familiar to us, they did have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women sat on chairs to eat, while the rich preferred to gather for banquets and recline while eating.
Foods introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later could not have been part of the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, regarding it as the god's dwelling place.
People offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has a courtyard open to the public, and an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Some unique towers are shaped like pyramids and are called ziggurats, which were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is God's special sanctuary.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing is not so important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
The women are cooking in the courtyard; the shops are actually open counters facing the street. They use stones to build houses.
Canaan has no large forests, so lumber is very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Nordic saga, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and sailed west, discovering land, which he then named Greenland.
But regardless of whether he discovered it or not, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although all belonging to "Scandinavia," there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not the case. Although there is something written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document and is upside down.
Although the author remains unknown, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) is said to have been stored rolled up when it was first written.
Therefore, it is likely that this symbol was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by "Vichy" Frenchmen. These Frenchmen reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, choosing not to resist the invaders but to cooperate with them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France in an offensive known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a group of people (a society) living together and working cooperatively.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis" (meaning "of a citizen"), and is related to the Latin words "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "city-state"), which also defines the scale of society in some way.
City-states were the precursors to nations. Civilizational cultures imply the intergenerational transmission of knowledge, the lingering and preservation of cultural footprints, and the fair dissemination of culture.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence, and are not regarded as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government (with Congress as its sole component) under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to tax, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it could only rely on state governments to enforce all laws, and the state governments often did not cooperate.
It also has no power to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
These clauses can only be amended with the unanimous consent of all states, and the states treat the central government with such disdain that their state representatives are frequently absent.
Both the Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, with the latter winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making it the world's seventh-largest island nation!
Due to Japan's numerous islands, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geological perspective.
Western understanding of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island "Ilha Formosa," meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began to alter the indigenous people's food production methods, and hired Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) army controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing Empire declared Taiwan a province.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: the Intihuatana stone, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
To help tourists better understand the original appearance of the architectural complex, most of the buildings on its periphery have been reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm format, which was the dominant film size towards the end of the film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is a bit confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) have the same or very similar aspect ratios.
The often-abused and ridiculed rule of thirds, while creating dynamism, remains a simple guiding method and can also keep images organized.
It indicates that the most effective position for the subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the already wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was subjected to close scrutiny.
Despite the differences in language and customs among the countries of Europe, Christianity has united them for over a thousand years.
From the king to the commoner, its pervasive power influences everyone.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary fund is specifically established for this purpose.
The centralized system of the church existed in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether they were adhering to the creed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
They cut off the supply of critical military and civilian resources. This strategy proved effective, although such a blockade violates universally accepted international law established by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters, preventing any ships from entering the entire area, and even posing a threat to neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and isolationist.
Having witnessed the devastation and brutality of World War I, nations were eager to avoid a repeat of the tragedy.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and took a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Each period in ancient China had its own characteristics; each period or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, periods of dynastic change have always been unstable eras marked by the division into smaller, independent states. The most famous of these is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years and occurred during the transition between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, feudal lords engaged in fierce warfare to vie for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Hundreds of thousands of people died fighting for the ultimate power of the opulent palaces of Xi'an.
There are also many social and political impacts, such as the use of units of measurement, the transition from autocracy to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation does not belong to a single ruler but to the people.
Furthermore, after the revolution, official positions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful individuals the opportunity to rise through the ranks.
The same goes for the military, where rank is no longer based on seniority but on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond worldly life. He used to frequently go to a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself, having not only withstood the test of time, but also bringing an extremely vivid image to Muhammad's spiritual intention.
The cave is located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even knowing it exists, it's not easy to find. Once inside the cave, you are completely cut off from the world.
Besides the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing else could be seen. Inside the cave, one could barely see or hear anything from the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the Egyptians from the third century BC, and it is one of many large pyramids built to pay tribute to deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Kings (also known as the "Giza Pyramid Complex") includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to commemorate Khufu's wife and family members.
The "overbow" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "underbow" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Upwards refers to pushing the bow from the top end, and downwards refers to drawing the bow from the bow root (that is, the part of the bow you hold).
Up-bowing typically produces a softer sound, while down-bowing produces a louder, more assertive sound.
Please feel free to make your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed notes have musical meaning, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), along with the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were driven from Versailles back to Paris by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris by carriage, where they were surrounded by a crowd who shouted and threatened the King and Queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to completely open the windows of the carriage.
In front of the horrified Queen, a rioter brandished the head of a Royal Guard, who had been killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of its expenses and the interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the high profits gained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people became a fundamental income source for US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background that led to the order's formation.
The period in which the event occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, conventionally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, including technological push, technological necessity, and a strict definition – that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and its manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism include these two general ideas: first, that the development of technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influence, and second, that technology, in turn, has intrinsic "impacts" on society that are not constrained by social conditions.
For example, someone might say that cars inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, building a national highway network for just a few cars was economically infeasible, so new production methods emerged to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A high volume of Volkswagen vehicles can also lead to a higher rate of road traffic accidents, which in turn will drive the invention of new medical technologies to repair the injuries of those hurt.
Romanticism has a strong tinge of cultural determinism, stemming from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Against the backdrop of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures associated with geography emerged. These customs and cultures, being harmoniously integrated with the place where society is situated, are far better than any arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center for luxury goods began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked from the 10th-11th centuries to the 14th century.
Initially, dresses were deeply influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow cultural exchange, Western fashion may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the biggest advances at the time was that after the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agricultural activity carried out to produce food only sufficient for the agriculturalist and their family's needs.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that utilizes native seeds preserved within the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in subsistence agriculture. This remains the case in many developing countries today.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal norms, fostering a sense of identity among them.
Subcultures can be distinctive based on differences in members' age, race, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that set a subculture apart may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of several factors.
Members of subcultures often symbolically use unique styles of behavior to indicate their membership, including fashion clothing, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use cases of a few unfortunate children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, grew up without being socialized with the help of adults.
Such children are called "feral children," meaning wild children. Some feral children are confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because their parents refuse to accept that the child has severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is said that some people were raised by animals; others live alone in the wild.
If a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, their behavior (within the limits of their physical capabilities) will be very similar to that animal, such as exhibiting fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding instruction is not a learning method, but a means of assisting people who are just learning to use new computer programs or starting new projects.
Scaffolding instruction can be conducted online or offline. In other words, teachers are a form of scaffolding, much like the Clippy assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is built into the software to question, prompt, and explain programs that students may find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment devoid of cultivation, care, and education, but unfortunately, it happens.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster care system should provide everything that the child's original family lacks in terms of essential needs.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The internet's distinct characteristics add extra dimensions to its uses and the ways it fulfills needs.
For example, "learning" and "communication" are considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
In studying audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as new motivational factors.
The use of video has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions (facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that one can judge whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage can still accurately judge whether a speaker is sincere.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior might be a skill shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: dominant and recessive.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes variation from the pool of expressed genetic variation.
Due to separation and recombination, variation moves back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
On the savanna, primates possess digestive systems similar to humans, and the available plant resources struggle to meet their amino acid requirements.
Furthermore, failure to do so will have serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based resources to obtain would be leaves and the protein in legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting this protein unless it is cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a large amount of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
In conclusion, we shouldn't be surprised if the way our ancestors solved the "protein problem" was no different from the methods used by chimpanzees on the savanna today.
Sleep fragmentation refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do, use a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without being completely startled awake.
If you find yourself snoozing your alarm when you're sleeping, try putting your alarm clock on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other chronobiology-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea – known to have a diuretic effect) before bed, forcing oneself to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace one possesses is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The less pressure, the more actively vitality manifests. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment, and the only obstacles to achieving it are our own tensions and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings but expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and methods of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra, and visualization.
The core practice of Tibetan meditation is Tsa Lung Trul Khor (energy yoga). By visualizing different deities, practitioners purify energy channels, activate chakras, and ultimately achieve enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy of all countries during World War II, which facilitated cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, with the end of the war, conflicts in systems, procedures, and culture led the two countries to part ways.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
This war lasted 40 years, with proxy armies fighting real battles on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense lines had been breached, and the only remaining hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize the army.
However, these plans were almost overnight discarded like worn-out shoes when, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and established positions in Belarus and Ukraine after the invasion of eastern Poland.
To date, shipping is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the mission of the navy is to ensure the nation maintains the ability to transport personnel and goods, while also disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their personnel and goods.
A prime modern example of this is the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II, where Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy, mainly composed of U-boats, attempted to intercept this convoy.
Had the Allies failed then, Germany would likely have conquered Britain just as it had conquered other European countries.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, consuming and using their milk, meat, wool, and hides.
Domestic goats are usually herded in groups on mountains or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders (mostly children or teenagers), who are similar to the more widely known shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
England had already built wagonways as early as the 16th century.
Although the Mara trolley was simply made of parallel planks, it allowed horses to run faster and pull more, especially on the somewhat rough roads of the time.
Railroad ties were introduced very early on to secure the rails. However, people gradually realized that placing iron plates on the rails would make them more stable and effective.
This became a common practice, but the iron sheets would cause the wooden carriage wheels to wear out more severely.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails appeared.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man), humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus tchadensis may have already been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, join environmental movements, and even become environmental activists, reducing future disasters to some extent.
In many cases, this is very similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we want more than just a temporary fix, then we should find the root cause of the problem and eradicate it completely.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly due to human scientific and technological progress, while overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of humans have exacerbated the problem.
The handwritten draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th and then sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, a few blocks away, to be printed.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed, in what is now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" edition.
On July 8th, John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the yard of Independence Hall.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, and Washington read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the earliest extant versions of the document. The handwritten manuscript has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and continue to live on today, which are what we call "birds."
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Nowadays, almost all computers in use are based on processing binary-coded information.
A binary number can only take one of two values, either 0 or 1, and such a number is called a binary digit, or a "bit" in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not manifest immediately, and symptoms like vomiting are very common, making immediate diagnosis impossible.
The strongest indicator of poisoning may be the presence of open containers at the scene containing medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label on the poison for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to formally refer to this type of insect.
This term originates from people's familiarity with bedbugs, an insect highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are both nidicolous insects, adapted to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that has become a leading neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may make adoption plans for their children.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. In practice, this method can guide most scientific research.
An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, however, experimentation is not the only method. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on issues in all scientific fields (including psychology) were accepted one by one.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West drifted away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers largely depend on the endogenous cycles generated by biological clocks and their existence.
Periodic rhythms are not simply a reaction to external periodic signals. These rhythms have been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues to cycle freely for a period of time, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the key pieces of evidence demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of bacteriophages, and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the protein of bacteriophages.
Mutations can have a wide range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be inherited by children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts tourists interested in natural areas, who come to see natural landscapes, including wildlife.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and ecosystem research.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from the small town to go to work, and the people they pass on the road work in the very place they are leaving.
In this dynamic traffic flow, everyone is connected to and supports the private car-based transportation system in some way.
Today, science shows that this massive carbon economy can no longer maintain the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human evolution and development for the past 2 million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses the transportation system. And almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses of a similar magnitude.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints? Why do they break down every day? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have a certain reasonable consistency, which can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship was established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful for the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly made it easier for them to escape enemies and more efficient at finding food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage: they can fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many others hold the opposite view; they believe that the solar system revolves around the Earth, and so does the sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. Its water discharge is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching up to 6 miles wide.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the world's total river discharge into the ocean.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. Its water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the immense scale and advanced building techniques of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world, as well as the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws, regulations, and official communications.
Italian is also the language commonly used by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these elements can be found in their natural form in nature and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (order doesn't matter): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also proposed a theory that they can transform into new substances that make up what we see.
Alloys are basically made by mixing two or more metals together. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals, and of course, elements such as silver and gold are also metals.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit within the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, as soon as the pencil came out, it became a favorite of many people.
Regrettably, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status of pencils has declined and their use has become less frequent.
People now write messages on computer screens and never have to touch a pencil sharpener again.
People can only guess what the fate of the keyboard will be when newer products emerge.
The working principle of a fission atomic bomb is as follows: it takes energy to bring an atomic nucleus and many protons and neutrons together.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Split the atom again, and then release some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are likely to split with little or no stimulation.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
The crust is thinner under the dark spots and thicker under the highlands.
Because the crust is thinner, the near side may have more dark areas, and lava can more easily rise to the surface.
The core of motivational content theories is identifying factors that are appealing or generate interest.
These theories suggest that as people mature to a certain point and enter adulthood, certain needs and/or desires become internalized.
These theoretical studies explore why people want to do what they do, and what aspects of their environment encourage or discourage them from doing certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start leading former colleagues, two behaviors tend to emerge. One scenario is that they try hard to maintain a "close relationship" with team members.
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions and also has difficulties with disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
In another extreme scenario, this person might become a completely different individual from before, feeling that he/she must change everything the team has done and take credit for the results.
After all, leaders bear the ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for their corresponding offline teams.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may schedule meetings around different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of truly "invisible teams" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"Invisible Team" refers to the management team to which each member reports. It sets standards for all members.
Why does it take an organization so long to build a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
Creativity and originality occur when all available resources are effectively utilized across an organization's functional departments.
Therefore, an organization, in the process of working together to overcome obstacles, often brings about new innovative processes to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and conduct organized learning.
"Angels" (2006) interprets the continuum approach as a way to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approaches of cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes studies more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for scientists' research.
We have long known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors can affect a person's behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and workings of the brain in ways never before possible.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for building simulation models, which helps us understand the brain's operational processes.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction element, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, studying the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and customer problems, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial features.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-world problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields, and some home computers and video game software applications already have built-in AI systems.
Field trips are an important component of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers are happy to take students to places that buses can't reach.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or appreciate fine art in the classroom.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a great way to review the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online as scrapbooks.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often use careless grammar and spelling when they start blogging, the presence of readers usually changes this.
Students are often the most critical readers, so bloggers are starting to work harder to improve their writing and avoid being criticized.
Furthermore, blogging also "forces students to be more insightful about the world around them." To satisfy the audience's interests, students are encouraged by this to become smarter and more interesting.
Blogging is a tool that can foster collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional classroom instruction.
"Appropriate use of blogs can make students better at analyzing and thinking critically; by actively responding to online materials, students can find their own position within the context of others' writing and be able to propose their own viewpoints on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, a charming city with a bilingual system, highlighted by a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while to the north are the Muskoka River and the untouched natural beauty across the river.
All of these things contribute to making Ontario the quintessential image of Canada for newcomers.
Further north, the vast area is sparsely populated, and some places are desolate wilderness where no people live.
A surprising population data comparison: the number of African Americans residing in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island to date and remains a separate continent for wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France, and they are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to this land, a doctrine that prevails in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Town sea route from Europe to India.
It borders the Sahel region to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Female: It is recommended that all female tourists say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also help (but don't wear one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviors they perceive as harassment; furthermore, being followed or having one's arm grabbed are not uncommon occurrences.
When rejecting a man, be firm and don't be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, be decisive in your refusal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, with the port once known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, before abandoning it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of Medina's old city, shops selling Moroccan traditional goods like tagines, pottery, leather goods, and hookahs, as well as various trinkets, are ubiquitous, but these shops are all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the easternmost part of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. The lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
While Goma is relatively safe, travel to anywhere outside of Goma should be investigated beforehand to understand if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province has subsided.
This city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can explore Goma by taking a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price for a short trip is 500 Congolese francs.
Also, because it is relatively remote, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for a faraway and exotic land.
Today, although Timbuktu's reputation has made it a tourist destination and it has an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
This is a significant stop for Henry Louis Gates in his PBS special, "Africa's Great Civilizations."
This city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it is more Arab in style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 distinct ecological zones, supporting a variety of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship attraction of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, this park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
There are many benefits to buying a Wild Card. With this card, you can enter some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with the Hong Kong region and is the focus for many tourists.
The many buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline resemble a glittering bar graph, standing out against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to appreciate the best views of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is where British colonists occupied, so if you're looking for evidence of this territory's colonial history, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian part of this forest is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps; they also contain remnants of vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, about one-third of which is water/marshland.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. It is estimated that the area is currently home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses run all day from the intercity bus station (across the river), but most departures, especially those to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Given that the shuttle buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
In most areas, you can find comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster minibuses.
For nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), shared taxis are a fast and comfortable option.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges, French Guiana.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high, and the bridge is 378 meters long with two 3.50-meter wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs checkpoint is also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní people are the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay, leading a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle while also engaging in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was once called the "Indian Province," a product of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción was built in 1537, Paraguay has consistently strived to preserve the city's many indigenous characteristics and features.
Argentina is known for having world-class polo teams and players.
The largest tournament of the year is held every December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here.
To learn about tournament news and how to purchase polo match tickets, please visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound, which is equivalent to the pound sterling.
You can exchange currency at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Pound Sterling is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars can often be used for payment within Stanley.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but US and British currency might be; please contact the homeowner in advance to confirm acceptable payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange it before you leave.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures often exceed 30°C.
Winter can feel colder than it looks: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but when wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons here: rainfall is relatively consistent throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are, after all, wild animals, and we should not feed or disturb them.
Park rangers advise: Keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, almost all large animals, such as bison, elk, moose, and bears, are capable of attacking humans.
Each year, dozens of tourists are injured for failing to keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
In addition, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking odorous food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
Apart from one British cruiser, all other ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful assembly in the town led to the death of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland spans two harbors, so there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (located within the North Harbour area) sit on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Here are mostly beaches, swimming is very safe, and most areas have shade from New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, right in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with vacationing families, and a wide variety of shops line the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One" beer. It doesn't have a complex flavor, but it's very drinkable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
You can buy many French wines here, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be more resistant to long-distance transportation.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're still concerned, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is still relatively unfamiliar. A small black coffee is an "espresso", cappuccinos have a high pile of cream (not foam), and tea is not served with milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The juice is expensive, but the quality is good.
The Great Barrier Reef attracts many tourists throughout the year, and injuries resulting from participation in any of the aforementioned activities are rare.
Nevertheless, it is still necessary to follow the advice of relevant departments, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear around the beaches and estuaries of the Town of 1770 between October and April each year. They can occasionally be found at other times as well.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily inhabit the ocean, but rather the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind, knowing they will have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
While travel agencies may help you book camping and other forms of accommodation, they usually partner with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast and airport transfers, and some even offer packages that include flights and hotel accommodations.
They can hold the booking for you if you need time to consider whether the price is right, or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to travel to the destination.
If any modifications or requests are needed, they should first be handled through the travel agent, rather than contacting the hotel directly.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider this an extremely important part of the music festival experience.
If you want to watch the performance up close, you need to arrive early and stake out a good spot near the stage.
Remember, while the music on the main stage may be over, other parts of the festival may continue playing music late into the night.
Some music festivals set up special camping areas for families with children.
If crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as navigating on ice can create terrifying noises for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include city sightseeing activities. Cruise passengers are visa-free (see Terms of Service for details).
Casinos typically try every possible means to make guests spend as much time and money as possible. They usually don't have windows or clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and staying in the casino.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high-latitude regions or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is very low, and you can't drive the same way as you would on smooth asphalt roads.
During a blizzard, the snowfall can accumulate quickly enough to trap you in a very short amount of time.
Snowfall, snow flurries, and water droplets or ice on car windows can also obstruct visibility.
On the other hand, ice and snow weather is very common in many countries, and transportation throughout the year is rarely interrupted.
Safari activities are perhaps the most attractive tourist activities in Africa and a highlight of many tourists' itineraries.
In its common usage, the word "safari" refers to traveling overland to view the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially on the savanna.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) tend to like getting close to cars, while standard equipment allows people to appreciate them better.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be intimidating sometimes, and you can see them more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "bushwalking", "trekking", or "rambling") mainly involves walking, usually lasting for several hours or continuing for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you may face a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most COVID-related cancellation policies had not been extended to July 2020—the originally scheduled time for the Olympics.
Ticket prices for most events are expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with an average ticket price of around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Even if the room doesn't have an iron and ironing board, many hotels offer lending services.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer (if you have one).
Be careful not to let the clothes get too hot (this can cause shrinkage and, in extreme cases, scorch the clothes).
There are many methods for purifying water, and some are more effective against specific pollutants.
In some areas, boiling for one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies; if you have concerns about this, you should consider buying sealed bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter dangerous animals that are not common in their hometown.
Pests can damage food, cause irritant reactions, and in more severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, transmit venom, or spread infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of killing humans through violence, are generally not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase goods without taxes at specific locations.
Travelers to countries/regions with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, and it's especially worthwhile to buy products like alcohol and tobacco in these places.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the most challenging driving conditions are found on the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, which frequently passes through numerous remote and isolated areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, you'll need to stay sharp: it's full of steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limit here is significantly lower than the sections of road before and after, with a typical limit of 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the speed limit is even more important than on other sections.
However, what's strange is that the cell service here is much stronger than many other routes along the way (such as the Pennsylvania Wilds).
German pastries are very good, and Bavarian pastries are even more diverse and colorful, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit desserts are very common. Apples can be used to make desserts year-round, and in the summer you can also eat cherries and plums.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes and strong coffee are often a perfect match.
If you're looking for a flavorful snack, you can try a jam-filled bun, a dessert that goes by different names in different regions, such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, and Krapfen.
Curry dishes are a dish based on herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
Curry dishes can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries, while in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is just a general term, encompassing a wide variety of local cuisines from across the country.
However, without further qualifiers, the term often refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now, Javanese cuisine can be found everywhere on the archipelago, including many dishes with simple seasoning methods, and the main seasonings favored by Javanese people include peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
Stirrups hang on either side of the saddle and are used to support the rider's feet.
They offer riders better stability but also pose a safety hazard because the rider's feet can get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him while running. To minimize this risk, some preventative measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders will wear riding boots with heels, and smooth and relatively narrow soles.
Secondly, some saddles—especially English saddles—are equipped with safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls backwards.
Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley, is known as the Yosemite of South America, offering a variety of granite walls and cliffs.
The view from the mountain peaks offers breathtaking and magnificent scenery. Climbers from all over the world are constantly pioneering new routes on its seemingly endless cliffs, which serve as climbing walls.
Alpine skiing encompasses both skiing and snowboarding, and it's a very popular sport where skis or a snowboard are attached to your feet to glide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a primary travel activity for many ski enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing has been around for a long time—cave paintings depicting skiers have been dated back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, alpine skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century; in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
This activity is related to alpine ski touring or mountaineering, but usually neither of those two activities are undertaken. Those two activities require steep terrain and stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine ski routes as similar hiking trails.
In good conditions, you can go further than walking—but only in rare circumstances can you achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on a smooth track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Typically, traveling across multiple countries means having to go through visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
However, in this regard, the Schengen Area is somewhat like a single country.
As long as you reside in this area, you can usually pass directly through the border without being subjected to passport control checks again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately to each Schengen member country, saving you time, money, and effort.
There is no universally accepted definition of which processed items are antiques. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, and the year restrictions in regions like North America may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, even though their age is much shorter compared to mass-produced counterparts.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people. The culture surrounding this industry is also important to many who make a living in other professions.
However, even from a traditional perspective, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, often using reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is a major source of income for Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is generally considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories can only provide a brief summary of the local situation.
Compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere, the advice provided here tends to be cursory, general, and oversimplified.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world. There are various types of severe weather, depending on the geographic location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Gales, hail, excessive rainfall, wildfires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones are all manifestations and effects of extreme weather.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather in their location, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to countries that may be considered war zones should receive professional training.
Searching the internet for "hostile environment awareness training courses" might help you find addresses of local companies that offer training.
This course typically covers all the issues discussed here, often delving deeper with practical experience.
Course training typically lasts 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, first aid training, and sometimes also firearms training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about survival in war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad must carry valid identification upon their return.
Whether or not to issue passports that do not specify gender (X), or whether or not to change documents to match a desired name and gender, varies from government to government.
The degree to which foreign governments recognize these documents varies widely.
In the era after September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints also became more intrusive.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery are forced to reveal their private information and cannot have their dignity protected when going through scanners.
Rip currents are powerful, narrow channels of fast-moving water flowing away from the beach and back into the ocean, typically occurring near sandbars or similar features.
The underwater topography creates backflows concentrated in a few deeper areas, where rapids flowing towards deeper water may form.
Most deaths are caused by swimming against the current and physical exhaustion; swimming against the current is unlikely to succeed.
Having escaped the rapid current, swimming back was not so difficult.
Strive to swim to a place where you won't be trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you've been discovered).
The impact of returning home is faster (the honeymoon period is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe than culture shock.
For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it can sometimes be difficult to readjust to their native culture.
After living abroad for a while and then returning home, you'll find that you've adapted to a new culture and lost some habits of your hometown culture.
When you first go abroad, people may be very patient and understanding with you because they know that travelers need time to adjust to a new country.
People might not realize that travelers also need patience and understanding on their return journey.
For children, the sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and before the show starts you can see them silently standing there.
Usually, you can always hear the voices of tourists and vendors here. The interplay of light and sound is like telling a touching story.
The backdrop features a Sphinx, which is also the narrator of the long story.
The scene is displayed on the pyramids, with different pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several countries claim sovereignty over the islands, which have a high concentration of bases; in 2020, sixteen bases were in active use on the islands.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, home to the settlement "Villa Las Estrellas".
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still-active volcanic caldera has been flooded, providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merge into a plateau before reforming into the Ellsworth Mountains, a range 360 km long, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or rather the Sentinel Range, is home to the Vinson Massif, the highest mountain range in Antarctica, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas with no mobile phone signal, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Generally speaking, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because calls can only be made outdoors where there is a clear satellite signal.
This service is frequently used in maritime applications, including yachts and expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide detailed information about connecting to this service.
For those planning how to spend their gap year, study abroad is becoming an increasingly popular option.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, who can take a year off before going to university without affecting their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year program abroad can substantially increase your chances of getting into better schools when you return home.
Typically, tuition fees are required to participate in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent sailing destination, renowned as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," and also contains thousands of islands within its lakes and coastal archipelago.
Among archipelagos and lakes, yachts are not a necessity.
The coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, but smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with roughly one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand have similar situations, but are unique in other aspects (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one to forty).
Most typical Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can have several full days to visit this historic city and then return to the ship to sleep at night.
A separate visa is not required if disembarking only for the purpose of a boat tour (regulation as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany as a highlight in their brochures. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and the price of the cruise does not include the cost of visiting the city.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, air travel can be a terrifying experience, especially for those who have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
This isn't something to be ashamed of; it's no different from the fear and aversion that many people have toward other things.
For some, understanding how airplanes work and the procedures of flying can be helpful in overcoming the fear caused by the unknown or uncontrollable situations.
Courier companies can earn high fees for fast delivery of goods. Often, time is of the essence for business documents, merchandise, or parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, there are problems.
If they use air transportation for their goods, on some routes, it may take several days to unload and clear customs.
The fastest way is to check it as baggage. According to airline regulations, unaccompanied baggage of no-show passengers is prohibited, which necessitates your presence.
The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to spend a lot of money to enjoy the privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, this doesn't come cheap: according to rough estimates, business class tickets can be 4 times the price of regular economy class, and first class tickets are a staggering 11 times as expensive!
Generally speaking, for a direct flight from A to B, there's really no need to look for discounted business class or first class tickets.
Airlines are well aware that some core passengers are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, and airlines will charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two regions of Moldova were re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It is the second largest port in Turkey, after Istanbul, and also a busy transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, surrounded by a vast gulf and mountains.
Scattered among the wide, tree-lined boulevards, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping malls are traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, yet the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the nearby island of Eysturoy. The village features a distinctive octagonal church.

The Scotturb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
You can also visit the Sanctuary of Fátima in the north, a world-renowned site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are actually visiting the site of a giant mass grave, a site of immeasurable significance to a large group of people in the world.
Yet many men and women survived here, and they are still alive today; while many more had relatives who were either murdered there or toiled to death, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please give this place the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not mark or graffiti on buildings to avoid damaging the site.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, and the vast majority understand it, while almost everyone understands Spanish.
However, most signs only use Catalan, as it is the legally designated first official language.
However, public transportation and other facilities also widely use Spanish.
The regular announcements on the subway are only in Catalan, but the automated system makes temporary announcements in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are notorious for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is still to try to behave and present yourself as a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will make participating in social activities much easier.
If you show a little basic politeness, the Parisians' rude behavior will quickly disappear without a trace.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with beech, spruce, and fir being the main tree species, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diverse microclimates, soils, and altitudes contribute to a rich variety of plant communities here, making this place world-renowned.
This region is also home to various animals and birds.
There you can see rare animals such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and grouse, as well as many more common species.
Women must wear skirts when visiting the monastery, and the skirts must be knee-length and the shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries offer wrap-around skirts for unprepared women, but if you bring your own, especially in a bright color, the monk at the entrance will give you a knowing smile.
Similarly, men must also wear long trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow them from the cloakroom at the entrance, but the dresses aren't washed after every use, so they might be a little uncomfortable to wear. They're all one-size-fits-all!
Mallorca's cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is primarily based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and exclusively uses olive oil.
Pa amb Oli is a simple dinner that is especially popular in summer: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any toppings you have on hand, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, except for the "Sie" that refers to you, should be capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method for distinguishing certain verbs and objects.
This can also make reading easier, although it complicates writing to some extent because you need to judge whether a verb or adjective is being used as a nominalized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because the pronunciation of most words is exactly the same as their spelling.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowels.
Additionally, it is necessary to ensure different pronunciations for "r" and "rr": "caro" means "dear," while "carro" means "cart" or "chariot."
Persian grammar is mostly relatively simple and follows regular patterns.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book can help you master more Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Undoubtedly, learning Portuguese will be easier if you speak a Romance language.
However, someone who knows a little Spanish might be quick to conclude that Portuguese is so close to Spanish that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, most pre-modern observatories have been eliminated, and are only preserved as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution was not as severe during their heyday as it is now, observatories were often built within cities or on campuses, making them easier to reach than modern observatories.
Most modern scientific research telescopes are giant facilities located in remote areas with excellent atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as "Hanami," has been a Japanese custom since the 8th century.
This concept originates from China, and the plum blossom is a flower widely loved by Chinese people.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the Emperor for himself and other members of the imperial nobility at the Imperial Palace.
Plants thrive best in their natural environment. Therefore, resist the temptation to pick them, even if it's "just one."
If you are visiting a meticulously arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also result in expulsion, with no room for negotiation.
Generally speaking, Singapore is a very safe place and easy to navigate. You can buy almost anything after you arrive.
However, due to being located in the "high tropics" a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to cope with both high temperatures (year-round) and intense sunlight (which is relatively infrequent when the weather is clear).
Several buses also headed north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Please confirm that the bus you intend to take will enter Hebron, and not just go to the nearby Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for a vacation.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to explore the interesting cities along the Danube River, or take a boat trip along the Canal du Midi.
They also clearly marked routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity, established to celebrate the birth of Christ.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
A tradition is to stay awake somewhere outdoors on Easter night to watch the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has its Christian theological explanation, but it was likely a ritual that existed before the birth of Christ to celebrate spring and pray for a good harvest.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil services on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregations typically flooding into the celebration as the midnight bells ring to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
Initially, the animals reached these islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of its remoteness from the mainland, mammals were unable to migrate there over long distances, making giant tortoises the primary herbivores of the Galapagos Islands.
After humans arrived in the Galápagos Islands, they introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, a period when the sun does not rise above the horizon for a certain time.
This provides an excellent opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark continuously for a whole day.
These regions are sparsely populated, generally free from light pollution, and you can enjoy the brilliant starry sky.
Compared to the work culture Westerners are accustomed to, the Japanese work culture has a more pronounced hierarchy and is more formal.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or titles.
A harmonious workplace atmosphere is crucial, emphasizing team effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees must obtain approval from their superiors for any decision they make and must unconditionally obey their superiors' instructions.
