This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a well-known theory already, but that fossils with details such as color and three-dimensional design could not generally be presented.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top with a light-colored or carrot-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – the researcher deduced that the rachis was likely a later development in evolution than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not downy feathers.
The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not chick down.

They discovered that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: it was discovered that the activity of every star in the system functions based on its brightness, its rotation, and nothing else.
The clarity and rotation are used together to determine a number of stars according to Rossby theory, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversal.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of that galaxy and the dark matter of our galaxy.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on Earth, causing tides, our galaxy also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in a similar way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter located around a galaxy remains around the galaxy in a sort of halo, and is made up of different small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a constant temperature, but it is consistent if they are large holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed paper with their chosen candidate's indication in an envelope.
After employees verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into a box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law codifies the process quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot box must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes enter that are not those of the voters who are counting and properly authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all parts of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following a specific procedure.

In her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani who finished ninth.
Four skiers in the women's group did not finish their races, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom were not classified in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Acting Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The defendants were named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver did sustain serious head injuries.
The street where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services were extracting the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was placed in James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterward, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Okedo, since that time, has been in the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh under accusation of killing his son.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial in court, but all eyewitness testimony may be tainted because his picture has been published in many places.
This is a common practice everywhere else in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have viewed publication of photos as potential prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems journalists are walking a dangerous path if they publish composite sketches of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is fully in charge of prosecution, indicated to journalists that it will not give any further comment at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the reading, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to base on the borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
Another topic that was covered included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
The forest ranger had to supervise the shooter in the supplementary case of pest control meticulously, as the case was being monitored in court and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Deputy Director of Conservation and Heritage at NWPS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the removal of the previous CEO as part of the package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPod malfunctions were reported, involving overheating, which caused a total of six fires and left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company declared "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there was no damage reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and for now, there are at least 6 confirmed deaths.
They released six hostages early, including children, elderly people, and the Filipino photographers.
Afterwards, the photographers took the place of an adult who had to go to the bathroom. They shot Mendoza dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that giving a hormone would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs in the mother's womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators discovered two flight recorder 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Her fellow fighters also came to honor Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the second night of the moon. Unique enough, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as strange as me... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign said that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this idea, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those asked believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, doubts arose about his health.
He couldn't take the necessary medications to treat his pain because they are prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25th.
Different people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water supply for Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since the time a comet struck Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "gossip and political nonsense".
It is speculated that he will try to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims can allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint an aircraft's position more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport running and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park and ride facilities will not be available at the site.
Fear of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was believed that this process took much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed in all sorts of ways. It can be hammered into a very small shape.
It can be pulled and stretched into a thin wire that can be bent and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made extremely thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted plates in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
It indicates the pH level by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance that was tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, damp hands, squeeze them together to form a ball.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outermost layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in each other's company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts our light and view.
A giant rocket taller than 100 feet is needed to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
He gave us trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Among them are more medium-sized feline animals that eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small feline animals (including domestic cats) that eat small prey in much larger quantities, such as insects, rats and mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special job that each cat has to do that means it doesn't compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social feline animal, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult males, together with up to thirty lionesses and cubs.
The females are usually family and close to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave much like wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large felines) in their behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a good athlete, a tiger can climb (not very well though), swim, jump very far, and pull with five times as much strength as a human.
Tigers are in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full voice, but more like a raspy, screaming phrase of words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, sniffing where they have been down in the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they move very stealthily as well. Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding in their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of living beings (a small population) finds itself separated from the larger population from which they came (such as if they pass over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island in a way that they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were previously in.
This new environment has different sources of support and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they start to resemble the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people inhale, and they take in carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the fiercest animal of its time, meaning it wasn't afraid of anything, with the exception of other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are filled with over 70 teeth, sharp as razor blades, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything it encountered.
We don't know for sure, but perhaps it had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, other types of mosasaurs, and perhaps it was even a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't handle it.
While most of their edibles might be familiar to us, Romans had their share of strange or exceptionally flavored foods to savor, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called 'dormouse'.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food sitting on stools, the rich men liked to hold their banquets together lying on their sides while they ate their food.
Ancient Roman food could not contain foods that entered Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the god's house.

Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of a pyramid, called 'ziggurats', were built to become part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yards, shops were simply open counters facing the street. Houses were built with stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and in his westward journey, he reached Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each nation was from 'Scandinavia', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it was not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence is written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (it measured 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it was probably put as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was not yet free.
The French "Vichy" were in power. There were people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were collaborating with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning civil, related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and that also in one way or another defines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture implies the passing of knowledge through different generations, a persistent cultural mark, and a fair distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government – with Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation agreement.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judicial power, it depended on state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to implement all its laws.
He also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles of Confederation required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states did not take the central government very seriously, with their representatives regularly absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most victorious team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, on a geographical level, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation of native wheat production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western part of Taiwan and the areas of the north coast and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Around 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was reconstructed, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
To this day it is still being produced, but more importantly, the digital camera format sensor inherited its image ratio.
The 35mm format is actually a little confusing, it's 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect of the proportion of this format (divided by twelve to get the easier proportion of a whole number) therefore says that it is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) are the same or almost the same as the aspect ratio approximately.
The rule of thirds, often abused and frequently ridiculed, is simply a guide to create dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
He says that the most effective spot for the main subject is an intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under critical investigation.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together despite differences in language and custom.
His pervasive power affected everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the major Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church serve specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had already been established in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and capital caused many people to question whether it aligned with the basic principles.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in various international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, posing a danger to even some neutral ships.
Due to the limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of many citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and cruelties of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that was in power had a different dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce fighting took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, vacancies were open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve.
The same applied to the military, because instead of basing positions in the army on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people or people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He would frequently visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, having survived the ages, provides a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Situated on the summit of one of the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find it even if you knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
You could see nothing but the clear sky, the beautiful sky above, and the many mountains surrounding it. Little of this world could be seen or heard within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the only Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and members of his family.
The "up arrow" looks like a V and the "down arrow" looks like an nit or a square without its bottom side.
Up means that you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you have to start at the grip (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up bow generally creates a softer sound, while a down bow is harder and stronger.
Feel free to write in your own notes, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
Frightened, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and expressing threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their wide carriage.
At one point a member of the crowd swung the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The costs of the American imperialist war for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to finance a major part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking companies.
Naturally, the profits derived from the long exploitation of the Philippine people will form the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is generally known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that, to a large extent, has bypassed cultural or political influence; and that technology, in turn, has inherent "effects" on societies, more so than socially conditioned ones.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily leads to road development.
However, a road network throughout the entire country is not economically feasible for just a few cars, meaning new production methods must be developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to more car accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair bodies that have suffered damage.
Romanticism had a strong element of determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture related to this geography arose, and these, in harmony with the position of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury epicenter began around 400 A.D. and continued until 1100 A.D.
His status declined during the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk fabrics and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was during this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital took place from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style became very popular in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western fashion lags behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time was a result of the crusades, with many people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture for the production of enough food to meet the sufficient needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native seeds saved from the ecosystem combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar mindsets who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, place, and/or the gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often display their membership through a distinctive and symbolic way of using style, which includes fashions, customs, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to make use of the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, setbacks, or intentional abuse, were not able to be socialized by adults during their development.
We call these kinds of children "wild" or savage. Some wild children were locked up at home by people (usually their own parents); in some of these cases, this child abandonment was due to the parents' rejection because of a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Troubled children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others were supposedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the woods on their own.
When they were raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit forms of behavior (within physical limitations) almost completely like those of the particular beasts that raised them, such as their fear or indifference to human beings.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of support but the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is too.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software and has the goal of questioning, motivating, and explaining the procedures that might present a challenge for the student to act on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that doesn't provide food, doesn't give love, and isn't educational, but it does happen.
We notice that the foster family system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, people who care for the children with love, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Foster families must provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage focus and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivational aspects for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" are also aspects of new motivation that Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified when they investigated audience reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has brought important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that can last a couple of milliseconds.
Particularly, it is claimed that you can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, indicates how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless adequately understand sincerity.
He even suggests that abilities such as interpreting human behavior may be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination move variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
Furthermore, failing to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resource would have been the proteins available in leaves and beans, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide high-quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Taking everything into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep within a short time thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm in your sleep, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room, that forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another option based on biorhythms involves drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, known to stimulate urination) before going to bed, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positively the life force presents itself. Every person has the potential to find peace and absolute satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many Yoga techniques from India.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love that contains everything.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is Deity Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the illumination of consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the conflict of systems, processes, and culture led to the end of cooperation between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and thus the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in real battles, by armies of representatives, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and their only hope was to withdraw and reorganize together with the Romanian fortification.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the regions east of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport products is one of the most efficient ways to move large quantities of people and products across the ocean.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and products, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and products.
One of the most recent and remarkable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats began to be domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and leather.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in numbers that roamed around on hills or grassy areas, often cared for by goat herders who were frequently children or adolescents, comparable to the more widely known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Horse-drawn trams were built from the 16th century in England.
Although the horse-drawn trams barely consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly worse streets of the day.
Rails with cross connections were introduced fairly quickly to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails could be more efficient if they had an iron tip on the upper part.
This became a common practice, but the iron was causing more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails were introduced.
The first known transportation was walking; people started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (humans standing upright).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright regularly.
In the fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, specializations were found that allowed them to walk on two legs, although Sahelanthropus may have been able to walk on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly with the environment, we can unite with the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to a certain degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't only want a temporary solution, then we must look for the root of the problems, and we must deactivate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and that problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten and signed copy was sent by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson to the printing press of John Dunlap just a couple of blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made of what is now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first time the document was read publicly was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6th, one was sent to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" that are still known to exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many modern paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them look like a dinosaur.
They have scaled feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, meaning 0 or 1, and using computer terminology these numbers are known as binary digits - or bits.
Internal poisoning will not be evident immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from the old knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both the Assassin bug and the bed bug stay close to where they are born, adapting to life in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), positioning it as the leading neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or the interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, scientific investigations are guided not only by experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, but also by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek dwindled, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
For most living beings, including bacteria, insects, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been documented that are not simply reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that, even when there are no external signals, will continue to operate for a period in free-running cycles.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages (small viruses that infect bacteria), or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including plants and animals living freely in nature.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to work, while others whose work destination is the place they just left pass them by.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is connected to, and supports, a car-based family transportation system in one way or another.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has expelled the biosphere from one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do the transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are the transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you cannot predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically more or less.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects are the first animals that flew in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies faster, find food, and reproduce more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings behind their bodies.
This gives them a wider range to hide in smaller places from their natural enemies.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are cicadas and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people thought the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the world doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest in the world. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with some places being six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City's population is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language that most of those who work for the government use every day, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People knew about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of these can be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively easy to obtain with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
"Alloy" is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is a matter of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out, then.
Unfortunately, according to newer writing methods that seemed to appear, the pencil was degraded to a lesser status and use.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens, without ever having to come near a typewriter.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to compose a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
The style of climbing a heavy cart up a mountain. By splitting the nucleus again, some of that energy is then released.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no push.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria (dark-colored rocks on the moon) and thicker under the more mountainous parts.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for magma to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they mature and become adults.
These theories look at what motivates certain people to desire the things they do, and which things in their environment will cause them to do or refrain from doing certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can arise when managers start leading their former peers. One extreme of the spectrum involves trying to remain "one of them".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, executing disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable for damages.
At the other extreme, the person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they need to change everything the team has been doing and do it their way.
Ultimately, the leader is the one who is finally responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in division between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, since their team can meet according to the different time zones that their local management team might not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One objective for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively through the functional departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can manifest.
As a result, an organization's process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead them to a new process of innovation to serve the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum procedure as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. For this reason, it reduces the area of investigation and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between cerebral pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning, and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnoses and client questions, as well as recognize handwriting, voice, and faces.
Things like that have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Currently, the AI system is used frequently in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military service, and also various home computers and video game software applications have been built.
Excursions are a big part of any lesson locale. Often a teacher wants to take their students to places where a train or bus isn't an option.
Technology offers the solution of virtual excursions. The students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, they remodel the website every year, but they keep older versions online to serve as albums.
"Blogs" can also help improve a student's writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with grammar and spelling errors, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audiences, the blogger is starting to make an effort to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Besides this, "blogging" "obliges students to have more knowledge of the world around them." The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
"Blogging" is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writing and also delineate their own perspectives on particular problems (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and boasts a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario stand out as, what people from abroad consider, typically Canadian.
The larger areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited forests.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the EU than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the other islands, and it's practically a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and this took great form in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sable and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they may consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural difference or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
The Berber fishermen founded the modern city of Casablanca in the 10th century AD, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, like "tajine", ceramics, leather goods, "hookah" and a whole range of "geegaws", but all of it is for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the fighting situation in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest treks to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short distance.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special program Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city is in stark contrast compared to the rest of the country's cities, because it has a more Arab style than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is a daily conservation fee and an entrance fee for the park.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a "Wild Card," which provides entry to either a selection of South African parks or to all the South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The Hong Kong skyline of buildings has been likened to a shimmering bar graph made evident by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head in the opposite direction towards the Kowloon coast.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonizers took as their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only mangrove swamps — they contain some of the last remaining strongholds of the mighty forests that once covered the "Gangetic" area.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered in water/swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those going in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because the inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts have the service of small buses of Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters high. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but its opening to traffic did not take place until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní tribe was the most significant indigenous group that lived in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the West Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous natives.
The Spaniards initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain many aspects of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which has a fixed value equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the islands outside of the center, credit cards will probably not be accepted; however, British and American currency may be accepted; check in advance with establishment owners which form of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are normal.
Winter can be disappointingly chilly: temperatures occasionally drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities' rules, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Regardless of how tame they may seem, bison, elk, moose, deer, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid cooking strong-smelling foods and maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is divided into two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches and safe for swimming, and most have shady spots provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburban area of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a wide variety of shops along the beach. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There is a lot of French wine, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia would be better for traveling.
The tap water is perfectly fine to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're feeling worried.
For Australians, the concept of a 'flat white' coffee with milk is foreign. A 'short black' is an 'espresso', cappuccino comes with a peak filled with cream (not foam), and they serve tea without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many reef excursions take place throughout the year, and injuries caused by any of these on the reef are very few.
However, take advice from authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety notices.
Box jellyfish are present near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally they may be present outside of these seasons.
There are sharks present, however they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not normally live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Making reservations in advance eliminates the traveler's worry about whether they will have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agencies frequently have arrangements with specific hotels, however you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combinations of flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or if you need to arrange other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, any changes or requests must go through the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of visitors to music festivals decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have ended, there are other sections of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the Baltic Sea in the northern part during winter, check the location of the cabin, because passing through ice causes a horrible noise for those more traumatized.
Cruise trips to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money that their guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have food, special drinks, and offer entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them at the place.
Some of the sites offer free alcoholic beverages. But drunkenness hinders sound judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain roads should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low, and you can't drive like you drive on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall that you can get stranded in very little time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic almost always continues to move throughout the year without interruption.
Safaris are probably what attracts the most tourism to Africa and are the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, in popular usage, refers to a trip on land to see the tremendous African nature, particularly on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars, and standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and panthers are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or going "footing") consists of walking, for a couple of hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics; it previously hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since last March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, the date the Olympics were rescheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't feel like ironing your clothes, you can use a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in a worse case cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not normally considered pests.
Buying tax-free products is an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excises in certain places.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont contains the most challenging driving conditions of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated and remote wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural terrain, stay calm: perpendicular ascents, narrow roads, and sharp turns are dominant.
Speed limit signs are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Remarkably, however, cell phone service is stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g., in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their neighbors to the south, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apples baked in pie throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance during summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cake often goes particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but still rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions or in the northern parts of India and Pakistan, yogurt is generally used in curry; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a very wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the nation.
However, if it is used without further specification, the term tends to refer to the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely available throughout the archipelago today, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a series of simply seasoned dishes, with the dominant flavors being the Javanese favorites of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrup is a foot support for the rider that hangs on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have some safety concerns due to the possibility of a rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, the rider must wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider who is falling.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and huge boulders.
The mountaintops include impressive views from the highest points. Climbing enthusiasts from all over the world are constantly creating new routes among the infinite potential of the walls.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving sliding down a snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings show skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
Skiing downhill as a sport goes back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational ski club.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called backcountry ski, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but does not usually involve alpine skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering, the latter of which are done on steeper terrain and require stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good condition you will be able to cover distances slightly greater than walking – but you will only very rarely find the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on already prepared routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to apply for visas and undergo passport control multiple times.
The Schengen area, however, functions like one country in this aspect.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas from the other Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and documents.
There isn't a universal definition describing which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antique.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Niche products can be defined as antique, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important part of Sámi life, and the culture related to the business is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, though, not all Sami participated in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting, and similarly, reindeer herding more as pack animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to seek advice from other governments besides your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The viewpoints presented are often rushed, general, and highly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the common term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can happen everywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which depend on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, heavy rain, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of inclement weather affecting their area, as this may affect travel plans.
Any person planning a visit to a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for 'Hostile environment course' will probably give you the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, generally with practical experience.
A course will typically be 2-5 days and will involve role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Passengers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to correspond with the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents also varies just as widely.
Searches at security checkpoints became much more intensive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through the scanner with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow of water returning from waves that have broken on the beach, often near a reef or something similar.
Because of the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in a couple of deeper sections, and a strong current towards deeper water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to focus on a path that you won't go down again in the current or, depending on your abilities and if they've taken notice of you, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock affects you more quickly than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), it lasts longer, and it can be more severe.
Travelers who have adjusted to a new culture easily sometimes have difficulty readjusting to their culture of origin.
When returning home after living abroad, you adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your own culture.
When you initially went abroad, people were probably understanding and showed patience with you, knowing that a traveler in a new country has to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Most of the time you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is just like a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx serves as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and light shines on the different pyramids.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations, and have the most bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the Peninsula. The largest one is King George Island with the colony of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region in the south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of this Peninsula connect with the mesas, then they come together again to form the 360 kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, with the summit Mount Vinson at 4892 meters.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a cellular phone, because you need to be outside with a direct line of sight to the satellite in order to make a phone call.
Ship navigation frequently uses this service, including recreational boats, and also expeditions that need remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular for people who have just finished school, giving them a year to go abroad before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year course abroad can truly increase your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your country.
Typically, there will be a fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing. The "land of a thousand lakes" also consists of thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos on the coast.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and lagoons.
Although the archipelagos on the coast and the larger lagoons are indeed large enough to offer a different experience for any yacht, smaller boat, or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national pastime of Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This figure is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in itself something unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figures are one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two full days while returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only disembark the ship using the ship's own excursion, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises mention Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fear and personal aversion to other things that many people have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help conquer the fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for smaller companies there was a problem.
If they had sent things by air cargo, on some routes it could have taken many days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't let them send baggage without a passenger, so this is where your part begins.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on a direct flight from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the Transnistria Republic, which proclaimed itself in eastern Moldova, has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The major religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Formerly the ancient city of Smyrna, today it is a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, built around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are juxtaposed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble dove sculptures on some of the tombs.
It's worth it to stroll around for half an hour in the fascinating town.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which gained fame for strangers after a fervent account of its splendors pointed out by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels to Sintra regularly, and it stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the grand Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Santuario), a place world-famous for the apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass burial site, and also a site of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived that time, and many more who had loved ones who were killed or forced to work until they died there, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect that it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of them prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because the law establishes it as the primary official language.
Yet Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements are made in the Metro only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Paris residents have a reputation for being self-centered, insolent, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is still to behave excellently, to behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make your stay considerably easier.
The Parisian's abrupt exterior will quickly evaporate if you show some basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests with beech and fir trees, and a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its scale of microclimates, different soil types, and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Uncommon fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, buzzard, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie (wood grouse) can be found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders as well.
Most of the monasteries offer coverings for women who do not come prepared, but if you have brought your own, especially one with a bright color, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same vein, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow these from the assortment at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so it is possible that you will not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, one size fits all!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular meal, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato and any available food such as cheese, salted fish, etc.
All nouns, along with the word "Sie" for "you" (formal), always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
Undoubtedly, it makes reading easier, although writing is a bit complicated due to the need to know whether to use a verb or adjective in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c, i, and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar introduction will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that if you speak a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese seems so similar that there's no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated nowadays and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution was not the kind of problem it is today when they were important, they are often located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the primrose was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally equipped garden, if you collect "specimens" you'll be thrown out, no questions asked.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But as it is situated in the tropical zone just a few degrees north of the equator you have to deal with both heat (always) and harsh sun (when the sky is clear, less common).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you plan to take goes into Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement called Kiryat Arba.
Small lakes can be a good theme to base a vacation around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube, or sail on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes that are popular for walking or cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays for Christianity, and it is celebrated as the day of Jesus' birth.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have also adopted many of the traditions surrounding the holiday.
There is a tradition to spend Easter Sunday night awake in an exposed place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Many traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil Mass early Saturday morning during the Easter weekend, where congregations often begin the celebration at 12 midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands got here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, and so the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic area in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark for approximately 24 hours a day.
Since not many people live in these areas, and light pollution is therefore usually not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Scrubs are worn as standard professional attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or job title.
Workplace harmony is crucial, emphasizing teamwork over praising individual achievement.
Employees often need to get approval from their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without question.
