Ring also reached a settlement agreement with its competitor, the security company ADT Corporation.
Although one experimental vaccine appears to reduce mortality from Ebola, no drugs have proven capable of curing existing infections to date.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies later showed less benefit than was hoped for in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used for comparison, i.e., the researchers used the vaccine as a baseline and compared it to the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the unlimited need of the Olympic family to work towards a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes, members, and their sports are better served by continuing with real change within the federation, rather than leaving a vacuum.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how abuse, of the scale described with such courage by those who suffered at the hands of Larry Nassar, could have gone unseen for so long, and welcomes all changes that are necessary and appropriate.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal — to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can realize their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides information that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional shape.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored underneath.
The discovery also demonstrates how bird feathers have evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers have a poorly developed rachis but possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – scientists concluded that the rachis likely formed later in the evolutionary process.
The feather composition suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, not downy plumage.
Researchers concluded that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not downy fluff.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning. Two police officers were killed and more than twenty others were injured.

Their conclusion was that the sun operates according to the same fundamental principles as other stars: All stellar activity in the system turned out to be determined by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly of a theoretical nature, but the program was built to simulate observations of the Sagittarius A* (Sagittarius A star) region.
The effect the team was looking for stemmed from a tidal force between the dark matter of the nebula and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
The Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy, just like the moon pulls on the Earth and causes tides.
The scientists concluded that dark matter affected other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory describes how most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around it as a kind of halo and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered an extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis bacterium (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said he believed the new variant was "very difficult to deal with and extremely dangerous due to a high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the plague at the hospital, believes Dr. Moll, and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect about 10 to 15 people if they come into close contact with them.
The percentage of XDR-TB among the entire group of tuberculosis patients, however, still appears to be very low, or 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 patients infected during a specific period in South Africa.

The body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53 years old, was found covered with blood-soaked carpets.
The police said the body appeared to have been there for about a day.
The first cases of the disease were reported during this period, at the end of July.
The disease is carried by pigs and then transmitted to humans by mosquitoes.
The epidemic has prompted Indian authorities to implement such measures, for example, the distribution of pig catchers in severely affected locations, the distribution of thousands of mosquito nets, and the spraying of insecticides.
The authorities have also promised several million vials of meningitis vaccine. This will help healthcare institutions prepare for the coming year.
Plans for vaccine distribution in areas historically most affected this year were delayed due to lack of funding and low prioritization compared to other diseases.

They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it's consistent with these being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the US Geological Survey (USGS), a team in astrogeology and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Elections in France have generally not been very technical: voters go aside into a voting booth, mark the appropriate candidate on a printed sheet, and then put it in an envelope.
Once election officials have confirmed the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law documents the process in considerable detail.
Since 1998, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except from legitimate voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe the entire process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In the other competition, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind Claudia Loesch of Austria, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes behind Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four female skiers in the women's sitting category did not finish, and 45 out of a total of 117 competitors in the giant slalom did not qualify.
The police in Madhya Pradesh recovered a stolen computer and mobile phone.
The Senior Superintendent of Police, D K Arya, said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Assistant Commissioner of Police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, reported that the accused had appeared in court with his face covered.
Despite the fact that three people were inside when the car was driven into the house, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was then brought before the Edinburgh District Court charged with murdering her son.
She is being held in custody awaiting formal charges and trial. However, the testimony of those who were at the scene may be tainted because her picture has been shown in many places.
This is common practice elsewhere in Britain, but that's not how justice works within Scotland. Courts view the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, points out that "journalists seem to be treading a dangerous path in publishing images etc. of suspected individuals."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, has told reporters that nothing more will be released at least until a formal charge is made.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants to base on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that the military remain in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, but the Palestinian authorities, on the other hand, only want the military to be in the area for five years.
Marksmen in the pest control test were supposed to be under close supervision by park rangers, who monitored the test and assessed its effectiveness.
Collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) led to the recruitment of skilled volunteers into the association's hunting program.
The four rangers selected to participate in the shooting operation received detailed safety and training instructions, according to Mick O'Flynn, acting executive director of conservation and cultural heritage at the NPWS.
Martelly swore in nine members of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended that the CEP resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The constitutionally appointed committee was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the authorities that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, started because elections were not held; specific elections were supposed to take place in 2011.
Around 60 cases have been reported of defective iPod devices that overheated and led to a total of six fires, in which four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents to the company, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management agency said that no domestic damage had been reported.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former police officer in the Philippines took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their tour bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued, and it has been confirmed that at least 6 people have died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly citizens, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He specialized in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
His research revealed that hormone administration accelerated lung growth during the fetal stage of the child.
Xinhua announced that government investigators had found two "black boxes"/flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also honored Luna's memory.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first agent. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said: "Luna was as crazy as me... maybe even crazier... love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
It was reported that Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain ended.
34% of those who answered the poll share the opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last royal head of state of Australia.
In the most decisive options of the poll, 29 percent of participants wanted Australia to be turned into a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent felt that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness has been called into question.
He hasn't been able to take the medication that's supposed to relieve the pain because it's banned at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several parties confirmed the discovery with different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have carried water to Earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and be a source of life.
Scientists harbor hope of gaining an understanding of how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, but comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said the rumor was "political drivel and foolishness."
It is believed that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of liters of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be provided, and trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and drop-off facilities are unavailable at the venue.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised questions about whether the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published last Thursday in the journal Science discussed the evolution of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, whereas previously it was thought that the process would take much longer due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza difficilis septentrionalis, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in any way. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided together. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
The material can be thinned considerably and applied to other metals. The material can be thinned so much that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called pH chemistry. You can create an indicator using juice from red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the substance is.
Acidity is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry ingredients together and then shape them with clean, wet hands into a ball.
Moisture on the hands will affect the outer layers, which feels a bit strange and forms a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with water in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Ruins of sewage systems have been found in the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were mixed together.
When someone thousands of kilometers away is called, a satellite is used.
The satellite receives the call and immediately bounces it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and our view.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall must be used to get a satellite or space telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the bicycle has done for us is to provide us with much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, automobiles, and other transportation of various kinds.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Then there are many small felines (including cats as pets) that eat considerably more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific task each cat is responsible for that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social species of cats and live in large groups called prides.
Groups consist of 1-3 adult males along with up to 30 females and young.
The females are generally closely related to each other, as they are a large family composed of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs. They are animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and also very deadly towards their prey.
The tiger's versatile physique allows it to climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump far, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is in the same genus (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather more like a sentence with growling, shouted words.
Leopards readily eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all the animals that leopards hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that leopards track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent and by sniffing where they have walked on the ground.
They have night vision and see very well in the dark, and their movements are stealthy. Leopard cats hunt their prey by blending into their environment and then making a swift attack on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to another island making it difficult to return), the environment often proves to be different from what they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors. Therefore, the new inhabitants need different qualities or adaptability to be strong competitors compared to what was before.
The original inhabitants haven't changed at all. They still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new inhabitants begin to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other inhabitants.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have become so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
This is called speciation, which simply means that a new species is formed. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants create their own food by using the sun and photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes out of plants and make our clothes out of plants. Most of our food is plants. Animals could not live without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time. It feared no one, except other mosasaurs.
The long jaw contained more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra row of teeth in the roof of the mouth, so nothing that got in its way escaped.
It is not certain, but she may have been two-faced. She ate turtles, large fish, and, like other mosasaur lizards, she may have practiced cannibalism.
She also attacked anything that came into the water, even the largest dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for her.
Although we would have recognized most of their food, the Romans also had some unusual feast food, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate sitting in chairs, while the rich men held banquets together and sprawled out while they consumed their food.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
As an example, there was no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not considered very important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden, and shops were just open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, and therefore wood was extremely expensive.
The settlement of Greenland was sparse. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and that when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, tribes of Eskimos lived there at that time.
Although the countries are all Scandinavian, there are many differences between the nations, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
You might think a treasure map is drawn on the back of the American Declaration of Independence if you watched the movie National Treasure.
However, this is not true. Something is written on the back of the statement, but it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is clear that early in its life this large parchment document (75 x 62 cm) was rolled up for storage.
It is likely that the note was added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated Northern France, but Southern France was not yet free.
It was governed by "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invading armies instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an attack into Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the U.S. Army and Free French forces managed to liberate Southern France and then headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a very large group of people who live and work collectively in a society.
The word civilization is taken from the Latin word civilis, which means civic or relating to citizens, which is connected to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also somehow defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. Civilization implies knowledge passed down through generations, a long-term cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Smaller communities often disappear without leaving behind significant historical clues, and such folk cultures are not recognized as proper national cultures.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government – with the Continental Congress as its sole component – under the first constitution.
Congress lacked sufficient authority to impose taxes, and because there was no federal executive or judiciary, it relied on the authorities in each individual state, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
It also had no authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles stipulated unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states showed such disregard for the union that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national team, has the second-best record in the world among national teams, and Italy became world champion in football in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Icelanders compete in international games and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to the archipelago, Japan is often referred to, geographically speaking, as an "island arc."
The origins of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established trading posts in southwestern Taiwan and altered the rice production traditions of the indigenous people, hiring workers from China to work on the company's rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the military forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was made a province of the Qing dynasty.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki and ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu boasts three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the area have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they were originally like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and that restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured to this day, and what's more, the image sensors of digital cameras are based on its aspect ratio.
The 35 mm format is actually quite confusing; it's 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds horizontally and vertically intersect (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, began to be viewed with more critical eyes.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had bound European countries together despite different languages and customs.
Her power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main tenets of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist primarily for that reason.
The church's central authority had been in power in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and wealth led to doubts among many as to whether these doctrines were being fulfilled.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain placed Germany under naval blockade.
The policy proved successful and halted vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally recognized international laws affirmed by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain deployed naval mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering large sea areas, which put even neutral ships in great danger.
Germany anticipated similar reactions to unrestricted submarine warfare, as reactions to this tactic had been limited before.
In the 1920s, a policy of peace and isolationism was the prevailing attitude of most Icelanders and nations.
After the horror and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to prevent such events from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China used a unique method of representing different periods, with each period in China's history or each dynasty distinguished as a separate empire.
The periods between the empires were unstable and characterized by disputes within the provinces. The best-known period is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, or midway between the Han and Jin empires.
During these periods, fierce battles took place between the various nobles who fought for the crown.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in battles for the highest seat in the great hall of Xi'an.
Many social and political influences are present, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocratic to democratic governance, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the nation and not to a single head of state.
After the revolution, jobs were available for male applicants, and the most ambitious and capable achieved the greatest success.
The same applies to the army because instead of army classification being based on class, it was now based on running speed.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a great interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave, later known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, provides a clear picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
The cave is on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
Actually, he's not at all easy to find, even if you know about him. Once you enter the cave, complete isolation takes over.
There is nothing to see but a clear and beautiful sky, and many mountains surround the area. From inside the cave, it is difficult to see or hear much of that world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
On the Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, one can find numerous pyramids (the Great Pyramid of Giza being the largest of them), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign for "upbow" looks like a V, and the sign for "downbow" is like a staple or a square with the bottom missing.
Up means to start at the top and push the bow, while down means to start at the frog (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Generally, a softer sound is heard when the bow is stroked upwards, but a more powerful and brighter sound when the bow is stroked downwards.
Feel free to add your own markings as you wish, but keep in mind that the printed articulation markings have musical value, so they should generally be taken into consideration.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced by a group of agitated market women to return to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a horse-drawn carriage and were surrounded by a mob that screamed and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the carriage windows completely open.
One from the mob brandished the severed head of one of the king's guards, who was killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves had to pay the war expenses of American imperialism due to territorial conquests in their country.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government in the United States to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government, which were rolled through investment banks on Wall Street.
The benefits of American imperialism originated in the super-profits caused by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the order's formation.
The time in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended with the Reformation around 1500.
Technical legal positivism is a concept that encompasses various ideas, ranging from technological pressure or technical obligations to a strong feeling that the fate of mankind is determined by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technologies themselves follows a path that is largely unconstrained by cultural and political influences, and that technology similarly has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile inevitably leads to road construction.
However, a nationwide road system is not financially viable for very few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher frequency of road accidents, which leads to new methods in healthcare being invented to patch people up.
Romanticism played a significant role in the cultural historicism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to the Romantic movement, the land shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture emerged that were connected to the land and in harmony with society, proving to be much better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is famous for being the fashion capital in modern times, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital when feudalism reigned in Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began in 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its position declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which had a higher value than what the markets in Byzantium could offer.
It was at this point that the title of capital of fashion moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period from the 10th-11th century to the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, stylistic trends in the West may lag behind by about 25 to 30 years due to the slow pace of communication.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest steps that came about because of the Crusades was that people started fastening clothing together with buttons.
Subsistence farming is agriculture for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming often revolves around a simple and organic system where seeds originating from the ecosystem are used, along with crop rotation or other rather simple methods to maximize the harvest.
Throughout history, most farmers have practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite as like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, demeanor, and slang.
One of the most traditional methods of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to rely on a few unfortunate cases of children who experience neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse. Children who do not enjoy social shaping by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child's neglect stemmed from parental rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is said that others have been raised by animals. It is said that some have lived in the wild of their own accord.
When a child is raised entirely by animals other than humans, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is as close as possible to the behavior of the animal that cares for it, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning might be easier and more engaging, learning communities take it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method. Rather, it should be viewed as a tool that provides individuals with support to participate in innovative learning experiences, for example when learning to use a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can exist in both virtual and real worlds, i.e., a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but the same also applies to the little Clippy paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual learning supports are built into the software and are designed to critique, prompt, and explain methods that may have been too difficult for the student to solve alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even due to compulsory care orders.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and developing, but they do.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster homes should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they were taken from.
The internet combines elements of both media and personal communication.
The Internet's unique characteristics created an additional dimension regarding efficiency and a satisfactory approach.
For example, "knowledge acquisition" and "social interaction" are pointed out as important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for only a few milliseconds.
The theory has been put forward that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by interpreting the slightest facial expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in the paper "The President's Speech," pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such an ability to interpret human behavior is something that animals like dogs also possess.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variability back and forth between two sets with each generation.
Out on the grassy plains, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to satisfy their amino acid requirements with the available plants.
If this has not been done in addition, it will have serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources that were easiest to access were proteins from leaves and legumes. Primates like us, however, have difficulty digesting such things unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also contains high-quality protein and essential amino acids.
When all is said and done, it shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees on the tropical grasslands still do today.
Sleep procrastination is the process of intentionally delaying going to sleep or waking up during your usual sleep time, then going back to sleep shortly after (10–60 minutes).
It can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, put it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options related to the circadian rhythm include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, known as diuretics) before sleep, forcing a person to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force that is present. All individuals have the potential to find complete peace and happiness.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has also been influenced by Mahayana's teachings on love, as well as a number of methods from Indian yoga.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of higher truth) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, and visualization.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is yoga connected to deities. Cleansing of energy channels occurs by visualizing various gods, the energy centers are activated, and the wisdom of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, disputes arose because their systems, methodologies, and cultures did not mesh well.
Before two years had passed since the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
This was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense line had already been broken, and the only hope lay in retreating and reorganizing at the Romanian border.
However, these plans fell through as soon as over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army launched an attack, forming the battle lines of Belarus and Ukraine after the army invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
It is most efficient to use ships to transport large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across the oceans.
The function of a navy has always been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable examples of this was the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The Americans tried to transport manpower and materials across the Atlantic to aid the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mostly used submarines, was trying to stop these shipments.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans would probably have managed to conquer Britain, as they did elsewhere in Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and ethnic groups began storing such things to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often tended by goat herders, who were more often than not children or teenagers, similar to the better-known shepherds. These methods are still used today.
Wagonways were laid in England as early as the 16th century.
Roads for horse-drawn carts were only laid with adjacent boards of timber, but horses could still pull the carts at greater speed and haul heavier loads than on the rougher roads of that time.
Crossbeams were used relatively early to keep the rails in place. But gradually it became clear that the utilization of the rails would be better if they had iron on top.
This was quite common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The first known transportation went well. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not always walk upright.
Bipedal characteristics are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have begun walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
It is possible to be more friendly towards the environment, become a participant in the environmental movement, and even be an activist to reduce the misery of the future to some extent.
This is like treating the symptoms in many cases. If we don't want a temporary solution, though, then we should look for the root of the problem and neutralize it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the progress of mankind in science and technology, but growing problems exist due to overpopulation and the immoderate lifestyles of mankind.
On July 4th, as soon as Congress had approved the Constitution, President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary of Congress Charles Thomson signed its handwritten draft and sent it to John Dunlap's printing shop nearby.
That night, somewhere between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are called "Dunlap broadsides".
John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th. He had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The oldest known copies of the document are the 25 Dunlap broadsides. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group has branched off. That animal group is called birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in the behavior of birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
Their feet are covered in scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they use both hind legs to walk, just like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary digit can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and such digits are referred to as binary digits, or bits in computer language.
Internal poisoning does not always manifest immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are very common, and therefore a diagnosis may not occur right away.
The best signs of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container with medications or toxic household substances.
Check if the markings contain instructions for first aid regarding this particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term originates from ancient knowledge about bedbugs. They are insects that have adapted to parasitize humans.
Both ticks and bedbugs are nest parasites, wanting to build a nest in the host.
Within the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), and MS is the leading neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in the best interest of either them or the child that they raise the child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the child's parents relinquish their rights so that other parents can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using a scientific approach. This method essentially guides most scientific research.
This is not the only goal because experiments, or tests to disprove one or more potential hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations are also guiding principles of scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers emphasized classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science were generally accepted, including those regarding psychology.
As knowledge of Greek dwindled, the West lost touch with the philosophical and scientific roots of Greek culture.
Many rhythmic patterns in physiology and behavior rely heavily on internal cycles and their production by biological clocks.
A regular rhythm, which is not simply a reaction to external regular cues, has been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillations that maintain a regular rhythm even without external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to splice their own DNA together with a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that labeled either the virus's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the virus's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells alone can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism appeals to people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying nature, including animal and plant life.
Examples of local pastimes include hunting, angling, photography, bird watching, and visiting ornamental gardens to learn something new about the ecosystem.
An example of this is to travel, take photographs, and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive to work from small suburban towns and meet others who are leaving their workplaces.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this immense carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developing countries, there are rarely as many complaints about water quality or bridges that are collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are the engineers simply incompetent? Or is there some fundamental flaw to blame?
Traffic flow is the study of the journeys of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations, and their influence on each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within normal limits. Consequently, there is a certain consistency in traffic flows that can be roughly represented by mathematical calculations.
To better describe traffic flow, relationships have been defined between three main traffic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist with the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. They used their ability to fly to escape enemies easily and to search for food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them more diverse small places to hide from predators.
Right now, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right, even though many believed the opposite, i.e., that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and even other planets).
It seems to make sense, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water volume than the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world. At its widest, it is six miles across.
A total of 20 percent of all water that flows from the Earth's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
The construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but on the other hand, pyramids as large and technically advanced as the pyramids of Giza were never built again.
The Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and has the smallest population.
Italian is used for legislation and official communication in Vatican City.
Italian is also a daily language for most of those who work in the state. Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of the Vatican are Catholic.
Since antiquity, there has been knowledge of elements such as gold, silver, and copper. All of these can be found in nature in their natural form. It is quite simple to extract these materials using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle claimed that all matter was made of one or more elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances that form what we see.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that many elements can be found in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are classified as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is all made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many when it appeared.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been demoted in status, and its use has decreased.
People now write messages on computer screens and never need to reach for a sharpener.
One can only let the mind wander about what the keyboard will be like when something new comes on the market.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. If the core is split again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus and therefore have a tendency to break apart with little or no friction.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
There can be more maria (seas) where the crust is thinner. It was easier for magma to rise to the surface.
Incentive theories focus on figuring out what motivates people or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt in adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about specific people that makes them want the things they want, and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Among the two most popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when agents start working for former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum, they try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This kind of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing sanctions, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
The tail end reveals a person who is not recognizable and feels that everything the group has done up until now must be changed, and the work made their own.
When all is said and done, the leader is responsible for the team's progress and failures.
This behavior often leads to a gap forming between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same quality standards as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members are often liaisons for the real-world group closest to them.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may need to meet across different time zones, which their managers in each location may not understand.
The existence of the true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique aspect of virtual teams.
"The Invisible Team" is the management team that each member reports to. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One reason to implement ideas about a learning organization is innovation.
When all available resources have been exhausted across all departments of a company, creativity and ingenuity may begin to surface.
As a result, a company's collaboration to overcome an obstacle can lead to new avenues in innovation to serve the interests of its customers.
In order for a company to become progressive, its management needs to create a culture for innovation, as well as information dissemination and knowledge acquisition within the company.
Angel (2006) reports that companies can use the Continuum approach to significantly increase their productivity.
Neurobiological information provides concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This therefore narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior encourages scientific research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental function.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and examine the composition and function of the brain like never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Artificial intelligence has strong ties to science fiction, but in reality, AI is a very important branch within computer science and deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require cognitive behavior.
Examples of this include controlling, planning, and task sequencing, the ability to answer customer analyses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines where the emphasis is on creating solutions to real-world problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but it has been built into many applications in home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of all teaching. Often, a teacher is more than willing to take students to places that buses cannot reach.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students can examine artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
A joint field trip is also a good way to contemplate a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year that covers their trip to the state capital. Each year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online for support.
Blogs can also contribute to improved writing skills in students. Initially, student blogs are often full of poor grammar and spelling, but the existence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the audience that is most critical, the blogger starts by trying to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
When students blog, "they have to familiarize themselves better with the outside world." The demand to address the interests of readers encourages students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a way to foster collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Responsible use of blogging "can encourage students' critical thinking; students can use online material to both take a stance on what others are writing and to express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada. It is home to many art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural landscapes of Muskoka and beyond.
All these points and more show what aspects people from outside the city consider to be particularly Canadian about Ontario.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
A surprising population comparison: There are more black people of African descent living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or linked to France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs came and also brought Islam to the islands, and it became very popular in Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, European influence began to be felt and colonialism began, with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovering the route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that women who travel claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (just not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that different cultures may manifest in what they consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you reject men and unafraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not do not justify this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategically important port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and jewelry, but all of this is made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets in lava flow, especially the central part.
Although Goma is relatively safe, careful consideration should be given to all travel outside of Goma in order to understand the state of the conflict that is still raging in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as one of the cheapest treks to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical price (within the area) is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
In addition to difficult access, "Timbuktu" has begun to be used as a metaphor for unusual, exotic places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation still attracts tourists and there is an airport in the town.
In 1990, the site was placed on the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat posed by encroaching desert sands.
This was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' "Africa's Great Civilizations" on PBS.
The city is in complete contrast to other cities domestically because it bears more of an Arabic influence than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and its southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The national park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecosystems that support diverse wildlife.
The national park is among South Africa's top tourist destinations and is a true gem among South African national parks (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, it is under constant protection and an entrance fee is required.
It can also be useful to buy a so-called "Wild Card" which grants access to a number of national parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and that is where most tourists visit.
The row of buildings that creates Hong Kong's skyline has sometimes been likened to a glittering bar graph. It emerges from the sea in Victoria Harbour.
The best view of Hong Kong is from the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
A large majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British settlers claimed as their own, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest belt on the coast in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland into the countryside of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Sundarbans National Park is the forest area located within the territory of India.
However, the forests are not just swamp forests; they conceal some of the last stands of the mighty primeval forests that once covered the entire Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/marsh.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the transport center (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase tickets several days in advance.
Small Japanese buses run to most neighborhoods. They are comfortable and safe.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017. It is also expected that the Brazilian customs posts will have been completed by then.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group living in the territory that is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who sustained themselves through hunting and gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, or the "Great Province of the Indies," was founded when Spanish settlers encountered groups of natives.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is well-known for its polo team and top-ranked polo players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo grounds.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be watched here at other times of the year.
For match news and where to buy tickets to polo games, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), and its value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted in most places on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and American currency might be. Check with the owners in advance what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the warm temperate zone. In the summer, it is common for the temperature to be above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "rainy" or "dry" season: precipitation is similar throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild, and you must not feed them or disturb them.
According to national park authorities, a distance of at least 100 meters should be maintained from bears and wolves, and a distance of 25 meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how peaceful they look, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack people.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so they should be given plenty of space.
In addition, you must keep in mind that scent attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with strong odors and make sure to keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British battlecruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
In the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches there because Auckland lies between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore coastline (in the North Harbour area) borders the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, safe for swimming, and shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the beach. Swimming is safe.
The most popular beer at the place is "Number One", it's not a complex beer but good and refreshing. The other beer from the place is called "Manta".
Many French wines are available for purchase, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might withstand the travel better.
It is perfectly safe to drink the tap water here, but bottled water is easily accessible if you are concerned about the tap water.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A "short black" is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with a heap of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but very good.
Many trips are taken to the reef all year round, and injuries due to any of these activities on the reef rarely occur.
However, heed the advisory warnings, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety precautions.
Common seals are found near coasts and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They are occasionally found outside of this time.
Sharks exist. They rarely attack people though. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the open ocean, but their main habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, the traveler can relax knowing that they have secured accommodation when they arrive in the area.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer package tours with breakfast, airport transfers, and even flights and hotels in the same package.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain some documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
Please contact the travel agency first regarding changes and other requests before contacting the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of guests attending music festivals choose to camp on site, and most of the guests consider it a necessary part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages is finished, music may still be playing in other areas of the festival late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
Before taking a ferry across the Northern Baltic Sea during the winter, it's best to check the location of your cabin, as the noise of sailing through ice can be deafening for sensitive people.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms and conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. Most often, windows and clocks are nowhere to be found, and it can be difficult to find the exit.
There are usually special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and keep them on the premises.
Some places offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. Intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
It is likely that anyone driving at high altitudes above sea level or over mountain passes will encounter heavy snow, sleet, and cold on their journey.
On ice and snow-covered roads, friction is low, and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In a blizzard, it can snow so much that you get stuck in an instant.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow, or icing on car windows.
Icy and snowy conditions, on the other hand, are commonplace in many countries, and traffic mostly flows smoothly throughout the year.
A safari is arguably the main attraction for tourists in Africa and the highlight of the trip for many visitors.
The term safari is generally used to refer to overland travel to view the magnificent African wildlife, particularly on the savanna.
Some animals, for example elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and the standard equipment makes it easy to observe them closely.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or going "on foot") involves a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Certain events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Since the Summer Olympics were held in Tokyo in 1964, it will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Games twice.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of March, most cancellation policies related to the coronavirus will not extend into July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to begin.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Wet clothes dry faster when ironed. In many hotels, you can borrow an iron and ironing board, even when you are not staying in a room.
Try using a hairdryer, if one is available, if you don't have an iron or if you don't want to walk around in ironed socks.
Be careful that the clothes don't get too hot (which can cause them to shrink or even scorch).
There are many ways to purify water. Some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil water for one minute, but in other places, the water must be boiled longer.
Filters vary in quality, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Tourists may face animal diseases that they are not familiar with from their home countries.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can cause harm or death to people, are generally not classified as plagues.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Those who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of road between Point Marion and Fairmont has some of the worst driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway and often runs through remote, sparsely populated areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: such roads are characterized by steep hills, narrow paths, and sharp turns.
Speed limits posted are noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent sections - typically 56-64 km/h - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
However, it's interesting that cell service is considerably stronger here than on other long stretches of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, especially in Bavaria. It is rich and varied, not unlike that of its southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, and apples are baked all year round. Cherries and plums are then added during the summertime.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to try a small but tasty pastry, you should try the pastry that is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen in the local language.
Curry is a dish based primarily on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry is either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the hinterlands of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is frequently used in curries, while coconut milk is generally used in Southern India and other regions along the subcontinent's coastline.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, and therefore the term Indonesian food covers a vast selection of regional dishes from all over the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term applies to cuisine that can be traced back to the central and eastern parts of Java.
Javanese dishes are now served widely throughout the archipelago. A diverse selection of simple and flavorful dishes are offered, where Javanese flavors reign supreme, that is, peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can be a safety concern due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but one of their feet is stuck in the stirrup, the horse can drag them along if it runs away. Several safety precautions can be taken to reduce the risk of this happening.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow, sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars which cause the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if pulled backwards, for example, if the rider falls.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring a selection of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain peaks offer magnificent views. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among its endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snowy landscapes on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Ski trips are very popular with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski freaks," and vacations are planned around the sport of skiing at specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers can be found from as early as 5000 BC.
Burn as a pastime dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or just ski mountaineering.
This is a related skiing sport but generally does not include alpine skiing or mountaineering, as the latter sports take place on steep slopes and require the use of much stiffer skis and ski boots.
Think of the ski trail like a hiking trail.
When conditions are good, you can cover a significantly longer distance than if you were walking. However, you very rarely reach the same speed as on cross-country skis without carrying a heavy backpack in ski tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small in size but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, one would have to go through visa applications and passport control many times when traveling between many countries.
In this respect, the Schengen area essentially functions as one country.
If you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state separately, thus saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no absolute definition of which manufactured items are antiquities. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiquities.
The definition has geographical deviations, as age restrictions may be lower in some places, such as North America, compared to Europe.
Handcrafted goods could be defined as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many in other professions.
Despite long-standing traditions, not all Sami practiced reindeer herding on a large scale, but rather lived on fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, with reindeer primarily used as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami homeland.
The use of the term "Gypsy" is widespread, especially among those who are not Roma, but is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misunderstandings about what Roma people are.
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you are traveling to, it may affect your health or cancellation insurance.
It would also be good to seek advice from other governments, but their advice is based on their own citizens.
For example, the situation might be different for U.S. citizens in the Middle East than for Europeans and Arabs.
Assessments are solely brief summaries of the political situation in a specific country.
The opinions that are often expressed are often superficial, universal, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a collective term for dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it that depend on geography, landscape, and atmosphere.
High winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfires are examples and consequences of severe weather conditions, just like thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, and dust storms.
Tourists are strongly advised to monitor the risk of bad weather in the area, as it may affect their travel plans.
All those who intend to visit a country classified as a conflict zone must undergo special professional training.
Searching online for "Hostile environment course" will likely give you the address of a company nearby.
Usually, all the material categories described here are covered in the course, and usually with practical training.
The course usually lasts for 2-5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid training, and in some cases, weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about life in uninhabited areas, but there are not so many publications about war-torn areas.
Tourists planning gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they have valid identification documents for their return home.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or documents that allow the desired name and gender varies.
The degree to which governments in other countries are willing to accept these documents as valid varies just as much.
Screening at security checkpoints has also become much more rigorous since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to be able to go through the scanners and maintain their privacy and dignity intact.
Undertow is the backwash from waves breaking on the shore, often on a reef or similar formation.
Due to the topography of the seabed, backflow accumulates in some deeper areas, and a rapid current of deep-sea water can form there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which may not be possible.
Once you get out of the current, it's no problem to swim back.
Try to take shelter or, depending on your abilities and whether you have been spotted, wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock occurs sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon period is shorter), it lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Tourists who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When returning home after living abroad, one has adapted to a new culture and lost some former habits.
When people travel abroad for the first time, others are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that tourists in a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for tourists when they return home.
The Pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in darkness and silence before the show begins.
Usually, there's a constant noise from tourists and salespeople. The story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is in the background and a kind of narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by multiple nations and have the most research stations in Antarctica, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where an underwater caldera belonging to an active volcano provides a spectacular and natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula that borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here on the plateau, then reappear to create the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains. They are divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, which peaks with Mount Vinson at 4892 m high.
In remote locations with no mobile phone service, a satellite phone may be the only option.
Generally speaking, a satellite phone doesn't replace a mobile phone because you need to be outdoors and in line of sight with the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used by the maritime industry, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require telecommunications data and voice.
The party providing telephone service should be able to provide more detailed information on how to connect to that service.
A popular option among people planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn about new things.
This is particularly popular with students and makes it easier for them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, you gain more opportunities for further education in your home country if you go on a student exchange abroad for a year.
Usually there is a tuition fee to register for such courses.
Finland is a great place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and archipelagos off the coastline.
There's absolutely no need to sail around the archipelago and the still lakes on a yacht.
The archipelagos and largest lakes are large enough for yachts, smaller boats, or even kayaks, and offer diverse experiences.
Boating is a popular pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven to eight people.
This is the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise completely unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most popular cruises around the Baltic Sea include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city during the day and then return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore to take excursions organized by the cruise line, you do not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin in Germany in their brochures. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea, and a visit to the city is therefore not included in the price of the cruise.
People of all ages and different backgrounds can be afraid on airplanes, especially if they have never flown before or experienced trauma.
This is nothing to be ashamed of: there's no difference between this and the personal fear and loathing of other things that many individuals have.
For some, a little understanding of how airplanes work and what happens during a flight might help overcome fear based on the unknown or not being in control of the situation.
Shipping companies are well paid for quick delivery. Time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but a problem existed for other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent goods by air freight, it took many days on some routes to unload and clear customs.
The only way to speed things up was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules don't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, but that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a thick wad of cash for the privilege (even better, have your company do it for you).
It can't be said that this is cheap: You can generally expect to pay up to four times the price of a regular business class ticket, and eleven times the price of a first-class ticket!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts on seats in business class or first class on a direct flight from A to B.
Airlines realize that a certain demographic is willing to pay a high price for the privilege of traveling quickly and in great comfort.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic. The country has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, these conflicts led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria) in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established, despite political negotiations having stalled.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and is a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping malls with traditional red tiles, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, though the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

It's worth taking half an hour to stroll around this interesting village.
Just north of there and not far away is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, made famous by Lord Byron with his dazzling account of the town's beauty.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the northern part, it is also worth visiting the shrine of Mary, Mother of God, where Mary, Mother of God, has often appeared, as is world-renowned.
Remember that this is essentially a visit to a mass grave, as well as a place that has almost unequivocal significance for a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived the ordeal here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please show the respect and seriousness that the place deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the area with markings or scratch graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, a large part of the population understands it, and almost everyone understands Spanish.
However, most street signs are still only in Catalan because the language is legally established as the region's primary language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other infrastructure.
Regular announcements on the subway are only made in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in numerous languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to enjoy your stay in Paris is to be thrifty and act "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It makes life much easier.
The aloofness of Parisians quickly disappears if you demonstrate common courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mainly with beech, spruce, and pine trees, and a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a tremendously wide selection of plants there due to the diversity in microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to diverse animal and bird species.
There you can find very rare wildlife such as the European brown bear, wolves, eagles, owls, salmon, wildcats, and grouse, along with many more common species.
During visits to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer shawls for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it's in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers to cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance. These garments are not washed after each user. Therefore, you might feel unwell in these robes. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used everywhere.
A simple and popular dinner, especially during the summertime, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and other toppings that are on hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns are capitalized, as well as the word Sie, which means you, even in the middle of sentences.
This is a useful function for distinguishing between verbs and objects.
This simplifies reading but complicates writing because you have to figure out whether a verb or adverb is being used as a noun.
It's easy to pronounce words in Italian because most of them are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.
Make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: Caro means dear, but Carro means chariot.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
If you familiarize yourself with the basics of grammar, you can learn a lot about Persian grammar and gain a greater understanding of idioms.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who have learned a little Spanish may initially think that Portuguese is similar enough that there's no need to learn it separately.
Older astronomical observatories are generally outdated today but serve a purpose as museums or educational centers.
Since light pollution in their early days was not the same problem as it is today, they are usually in cities or on university campuses, where they are easier to access than those that have been built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are located at enormous facilities in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Viewing blossoming cherry trees, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea originates in China, where the plum blossom was the chosen flower.
In Japan, the emperor held the first parties to celebrate the cherry blossom season only for himself and other nobles at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment. Therefore, you must resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
If you visit a botanical garden and take a "cutting," you will be ejected from the garden without further ado.
Singapore is generally a safe city and easy to get around. You can buy almost anything your heart desires upon arrival.
But because of its location in the "tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, one has to deal with the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (when it is clear, which is less often).
Some buses also run north to Hebron, where you can find the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check if the bus you are thinking of taking goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement area of Kiryat Arba.
Navigable waterways are an interesting option for summer vacation.
For example, to visit castles in the Loire Valley, visit the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip down the Erie Canal.
They also mark popular cycling and hiking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Atheists in Christian countries, as well as non-Christians worldwide, have adopted many traditions surrounding the holidays.
It is traditional to stay awake on Easter night at some outdoor location to see the sunrise.
Of course, theological explanations can be found for these customs, but this could very well be a spring and fertility rite in Christianity.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend. Congregations often begin the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals originally came to the islands swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the distance from the mainland, mammals could not cross over, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos Islands.
Ever since humans landed in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel around the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you get the chance to experience the polar night, i.e., when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore usually not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy stargazing.
The culture in Japanese workplaces is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Suits are traditional business attire, and colleagues use last names or job titles with each other.
Consensus in the workplace is key; emphasis should be placed on the performance of groups rather than praising the achievements of individuals.
Employees often have to get their manager's approval for all decisions, and they are expected to obey their instructions without question.
