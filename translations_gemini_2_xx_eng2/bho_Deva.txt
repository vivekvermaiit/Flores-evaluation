This not only confirmed that some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory already well known), but also provided information not typically obtained from fossil studies, such as color and 3D shape.
Scientists say that the animal's wings were chestnut brown on top and appeared pale or carotene-colored underneath.
This investigation also revealed how feathers evolved in birds.
No rachis, the developed shaft in dinosaur wings, has been observed, but other information suggesting wings—barbs and barbules—were present. Researchers believe that the development of the rachis, like other organs, likely occurred in a later stage.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they weren't used for flight, but rather for regulating body temperature or just for display. Researchers say that even though it's the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample appears to be the feathers of an adult dinosaur, not a baby dinosaur.
Researchers believe that while it may be the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen appears to be the plumage of a mature dinosaur, not a chicken-like downy feather.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in a region called KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.
In an interview, he said that this new type is "very disturbing and dangerous because it can cause many people to die."
The doctor seems to think that some patients may have contracted the infection in the hospital, and at least two of them are healthcare workers employed there.
In just one year, one infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 people they come into contact with.
However, the percentage of people with XDR-TB among tuberculosis patients in South Africa still seems low. Out of a total of 330,000 infected people, 6,000 have this disease.

The government has also promised to distribute several hundred thousand encephalitis vaccines, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.
The distribution of vaccines has been slightly delayed this year in the areas that have witnessed the most devastation for the past several years. This delay is due to a lack of funds and less attention being paid to this disease compared to other diseases.

In France, the voting process is traditionally a bit behind in terms of technology: voters seclude themselves in a booth and, from pre-printed ballots with candidates' photos, select the ballot of their preferred candidate and place it in an envelope.
After the officers identify the voter, they deposit their envelope into the ballot box and sign the voting roll.
However, the French electoral rules translate signals of strict action into language.
Since 1988, it has been necessary to have transparent ballot boxes, so that voters and inspectors can see that there are no envelopes already in the ballot box, and that it contains only the envelopes that authorized voters have placed in it, and that have been counted.
Candidates can send their representatives to observe every stage of the process. Volunteers will jointly count the votes under strict supervision and according to a specific procedure.

We only want to say this much to you all: treat us the same way we treat you.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill into law that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
This bill would have required violent video games sold in the state of California to have a sticker label that reads "18" and would have penalized the sale of these video games to a minor with a fine of $1000 per offense.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, this morning issued a statement announcing that Hyun and Price will both be prosecuted.
Huen has resigned and MP Ed Davey will be joining the cabinet in his place. It is expected that MP Norman Lamb will become Minister of Trade in Davey's place.
Huw Edwards and Price are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
Among the deceased were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cadback. Cadback was the driver.
Edgar Venzuela sustained injuries to his hand and jaw, while Christopher Schneider had to undergo surgery to repair his face.
He aimed the weapon at the fifth man's head, but it missed. Schneider's pain isn't going away, he can't see out of one eye, a part of his skull is missing, and his face has been rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider testified via videolink from a USAF base in his country.
After the event on Wednesday, she participated in two individual races in the Carpenedo Championship.
Her first run was slalom, the first run of which she couldn't complete. Out of 116 competitors, 36 people had the same result in this run.
Her second run was in the giant slalom, where she secured 10th position in the women's sitting group with a total run time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place winner Claudia Loesch of Austria and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place winner Zsófia Konkoly of Hungary.
In the women's sitting group, four skiers were unable to finish their race, and out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom, 45 were not ranked in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said, "We have arrested the five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered the woman's mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhoot Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandrashekhar Solanki said that the accused were presented in court with their faces covered.
Actually, when the car crashed into the house, there were three people inside, but no one was injured.
But the driver had a lot of injuries on his head.
The road where the car crash happened was blocked for some time until the emergency services personnel extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Before that, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekooya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of her child's murder.
She is in custody for questioning and investigation, but her photo has been so widely circulated that any visual evidence could be compromised.
This is a common occurrence in the UK, but Scotland's justice system works differently, and its courts might see photographs as potentially biased due to their printed form.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University writes, "If journalists publish photos of any suspect, it means they are walking a dangerous path."
The Crown Office, which has overall charge of the prosecution, indicated to journalists that no comment will be made at least while the charges are pending.
According to reports, the document will discuss the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
According to what was said, the other subject that has been put forward includes the issue of a sacred future Jerusalem state and the Jordan Valley for both countries.
After signing the agreement, Israel is demanding that the troops currently in the valley remain for another ten years, while the PA (Palestinian Authority) is only willing to allow the troops to stay for five years.
In the supplementary pest control trial, the rangers had to carefully monitor the target shooters, because the trial was being monitored and its effectiveness was being assessed.
NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. have partnered to recruit volunteers for the Sporting Shooters Association's deer management program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, park Conservation and Heritage Action Inspector with NPWS, the four marksmen chosen for the initial shooting were instructed to be properly secured and trained.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
As part of the measures being taken to lead the country towards new elections, the Presidential Commission last month recommended the removal of the former Chairman of the CEP from his position.
This commission was Martelly's response to the protests that erupted against the government in October.
This sometimes violent protest was started because elections haven't been held since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods overheating and malfunctioning have come to light, of which six caught fire and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says it is aware of 27 accidents related to those pieces of equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded to the delay in the Apple report by calling it "truly unfortunate."
An earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office, there are no reports of damage from the earthquake in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center says that there is no sign of a tsunami occurring.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists and took them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza started shooting at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
How many hostages have been released, and six people have died so far.
Prior to this, six hostages were released, including a child, an elderly person, and a Filipino photographer.
A photographer took the place of a woman among the hostages because the woman needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was later shot.
He followed in his father's footsteps and built his future in the field of medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he started researching premature labor in his free time.
Their research revealed that administering a specific hormone can accelerate lung maturation in fetuses.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. It's as unique as she was. She was a spirited woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was weird like us... maybe even more than me... I loved her and I'll miss her very much... I hope she's in a good place."
In a poll conducted before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of the 1,400 participants who opposed Australia becoming a republic was 8 percent higher than in 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, while campaigning in the 2010 federal election, claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Of the people who participated in the poll, 34 percent expressed their opinion that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At the time of the poll, a survey revealed that 29 percent of people believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The person who won a gold medal in the Olympics was supposed to swim in the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays, but due to their illness, doubts have arisen about whether their health is good or not.
He couldn't take the medicine he wanted for his chest pain because it was banned in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
In early February, many people used different hardware and software to verify its correctness, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets brought water along with organic matter to Earth that could form proteins and be conducive to life.
Scientists are hoping to understand how planets form, and particularly, they want to know how Earth formed after comets collided with it.
Cuomo, 53, began his term at the start of this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political drivel and nonsense."
It is believed that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions by flying airplanes on shorter routes.
This uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground-radar-based technology, to provide air traffic controllers with greater accuracy in guiding aircraft and providing pilots with precise information.
No additional transportation will be provided in Wembley, and no overground trains will stop. Furthermore, there will be no car parking or park-and-ride facilities.
The fear of lack of transportation increases the hope that the team's supporters will be forced to watch the game behind closed doors without them.
A study published in a science journal on Thursday reveals that a new species of bird is evolving in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have revealed that the new species evolved in just two generations, but this process takes longer due to breeding between a local Darwin's finch, the Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, the Geospiza conirostris.
Gold is useful in all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into very small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or made into a sheet and bent.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used for decoration in illuminated manuscripts.
That is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator from red cabbage juice to identify it.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic a substance is.
pH levels indicate the amount of hydrogen ions in a tested chemical (H in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton because it is a hydrogen atom that has lost its electron (since a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Take two handfuls of dry churan powder, mix them together, then press firmly with clean, wet hands to form a ball.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel very strange and form a kind of shell.
In almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, there were flush toilets connected to an excellent drainage system for removing dirty water.
Evidence of wastewater disposal systems has been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and the houses of Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that were for both men and women.
When you talk to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
In space, satellites pick up your call and send it back down almost instantly.
A satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images we receive.
To launch satellites or telescopes into space, a very large rocket, taller than 100 feet, is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us was make it incredibly easy and fast to move from one place to another, whether it was people or goods.
It gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them live cat species of medium size, who prey on animals ranging from rabbits to deer and stag.
There are also several small cat species (including domestic cats) that prey on various types of small insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is their niche concept, meaning a specific task that every player has and that prevents them from competing with each other.
Of the cat family, lions are the most social and live in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Being from a large family with many sisters and daughters, these lionesses often maintained a very close bond.
A pride of lions is very similar to a pack of wolves or dogs. It's quite surprising that the behavior of wolves or dogs is like that of lions (but not like other big cats), and all of them are equally dangerous in the same way when it comes to their prey.
A muscular tiger can climb trees (but not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times more strength than a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, jaguar, and leopard. Only these four cats can roar.
As a lion roars with its throat wide open, a tiger's roar isn't like that, but it feels like someone is yelling irritably.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can catch them, they will catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds. Almost every animal that an ocelot hunts is smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the ocelot hunts by tracking its prey on the ground, sniffing it out and pursuing it until it can catch it.
They can see perfectly clearly even in the dark of night, and they can move around stealthily. Ocelots blend into their surroundings to hunt and pounce on their prey.
When a small group (small population) of living things becomes separated from the main group it came from (such as when it wanders and ends up near a mountain or river, or reaches a new island, and it becomes difficult to return to its own group), then it finds itself in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, with different kinds of resources and different types of competition, the new population will have to adapt in a new way so that they can become stronger competitors compared to previous needs.
The existing population doesn't change at all; they still need to be molded in the same way they were before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it looks less and less like other populations.
Slowly, after thousands of years, or even hundreds of thousands of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable phenomenon and a very important part of the evolutionary process.
Trees and plants produce oxygen, which allows people to breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that we exhale.
Plants make their food from sunlight, which is called photosynthesis. They also give us shade.
We make our houses and clothes from trees. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals cannot survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, which is why it feared no one, except for other Mosasaurs.
It had razor-sharp teeth, like blades, numbering 70 in its long jaw, and the same number of teeth were also in the upper part of its mouth. Meaning, after entering its mouth, the prey had no chance of survival.
We don't know for sure, but perhaps its tongue was forked. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have also been cannibalistic.
This creature wouldn't spare any animal that enters the water, even if it was a large dinosaur, and the T. Rex would have no match against it.
We probably recognize many of the things Romans ate, but their feasts also included somewhat different and unique foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women would sit on chairs and eat, when wealthy people held feasts, they would lie on their sides and eat.
The cuisine of ancient Rome would not have included things that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The people of Babylon first built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People used to bring sacrifices for God, and the priests would fulfill God's needs through rituals and festivals.
Every temple had a courtyard and inside there was a sacred place where only the priest could go.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers were built as part of temples. These towers were called Ziggurats.
The top of this tower was a sacred place for God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses held no significance.
The Hebrew family spent most of their life in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; a table would be set up in the street, and it would feel like an open shop. Stone was used for building houses.
There weren't any large forests on that land, so wood was very expensive there.
Greenland was settled a little by accident. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for committing murder, and when he sailed further west, he found Greenland and named it.
However, the Eskimo tribe was already living there before his discovery.
While the whole region could be called 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there was a treasure map hidden behind the Declaration of Independence.
Actually, that's not true. There is something written on the back of that document, but it's not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written behind the Declaration of Independence. This was written upside down at the very bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that it was folded to hold a large (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) leather document.
Therefore, it can be assumed that this writing was applied only as a sticker.
D-Day landing and the subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the south was still not free.
This area was under the rule of "Vichy" France. These were the people who had made a peace agreement with Germany in 1940 and, instead of fighting the invaders, were working with them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied countries attacked southern France. This was named "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the United States and Free France together liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a culture with which a large group of people is associated, who live together, work together, and form a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means citizen. It is related to the Latin "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state. It also indicates the shape of society in a way.
City-states led to the development of countries. Culture associated with a civilization means that knowledge is passed down from one generation to another, culture continues from one generation to the next, and it spreads.
Small cultures disappear without leaving any historical evidence and fail to establish their identity as a civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states united for the first time to form a weak central government, in which the Congress was the sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state officials to enforce its rules, and they rarely cooperated.
It also did not have any authority to override tax laws and duties between states.
Before making the changes to the article, the consensus of all the states was needed, and the central government took all the states so lightly that their representatives were mostly absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was also the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, where people from Italy participate in international sports and Olympic events.
Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world.
Being an archipelago near Japan, it is often referred to as an "island group" or "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan's beginnings occurred in the 15th century when European sailors, passing through there, named it Ilha Formosa, which means "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change the primitive methods of grain cultivation. They started employing Chinese laborers in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty army (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 it was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu mainly has three structures, namely Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and Room of the Three Windows.
Around the edges of the complex, many buildings have been reconstructed to give visitors an idea of what it looked like when it was first built.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been rebuilt and restored, and this work is still ongoing.
For example, the most common format in the world for taking pictures of still objects is 35mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still made today, but it is certain that its aspect ratio is now found in the image sensors of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually misleading, because its width is 36mm and its height is 24mm.
In this format, the aspect ratio (obtained by dividing by 12 to get an integer) is expressed as 3:2.
Generally, several formats (for example, the APS family formats) are similar to this aspect ratio, or equal to it.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and made fun of, is a simple guideline for creating dimension in an image without distorting its shape.
According to this, the best place for the main subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds horizontally and vertically intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very rich and powerful, began to have its wealth and activities investigated.
For thousands of years, Christianity kept the kingdoms of Europe united in a single thread, despite differences in language and customs.
The effect of this pervasive power fell on everyone, whether they were kings or subjects.
A tenet of Christianity is also that money should be used to help people going through crises and to eradicate poverty. It is specifically for this reason that money is collected by the church.
The central authority of the Church in Rome has been present for thousands of years. This concentration of power and money raises many questions about whether the principles upon which it was founded are being fulfilled.
Immediately after the war began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
While this blockade broke with international law conventions and understandings generally accepted for the past two centuries, this strategy of preventing essential supplies from reaching the military and the general public was successful.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering the entire area of the sea, which also became a danger to ships that were not involved in the war.
Because this strategy had very little response, Germany hoped for a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the attitude of most citizens and countries was towards pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, all countries expressed a desire to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to America to work for the Edison Company, located in New York City.
He arrived in America with four scents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation that Charles Batchelor (his manager in a previous job) had written to recommend him to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different periods of time. This involved portraying each era or dynasty that ruled China as a separate and distinct kingdom.
And between every two dynasties, there was an unstable period when the kingdom was divided. In such times, the most well-known era was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In this era, there was a fierce battle for the throne among many wealthy politicians.
This era of the Three Kingdoms in ancient Chinese history was the bloodiest. Thousands of people were killed during this time to sit on the largest and highest throne of the Xian Palace.
It had several social and political impacts, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republic, the change to nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to any one king.
Besides this, after the revolution, employment became available to all male applicants, which opened avenues for success for people who desired to advance and achieve success.
The situation in the army was similar, because promotions in the army started being based on merit rather than ranking by class.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this worldly life. To contemplate and reflect, he would often go to a cave known as "Hira" (Diamond) on the mountain of "Noor" (Light).
This cave, spared by the passage of time, offers a very vivid and detailed image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
This cave, located on a mountain peak in the northern Mecca hills, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, even knowing it's a cave, it's not easy to find. Once a person enters the cave, they become completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. After entering the cave, very little of the outside world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the people of Egypt three centuries before Christ, is one of the many pyramids built in honor of the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Necropolis or Giza Plateau, located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), as well as smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
"Up bow signs" are like a V and "down bow signs" are like a staple, or like a square whose bottom part appears to be missing.
Up means you should start from above and push the bow, and down means you should start from the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Up bow often produces a softer sound, while down bow is stronger and more assertive.
Don't hesitate to make your mark with a pencil, but remember that the symbols printed on it are there for a reason in music, so pay attention to them.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market, having terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, forcibly sent them from Versailles to Paris.
The car they were returning to Paris in was surrounded by a crowd, and this crowd was chanting threatening slogans against the king and queen.
The crowd was forcing the king and queen to keep the car windows open.
Once, a man from the crowd waved the severed head of a royal guard in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses incurred in the imperialist America's victory over the Philippines were borne by the people of the Philippines.
A large portion of their expenses had to be given as taxes to the colonial American government, and interest was levied on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
However, American imperialism benefited the most from the long-term exploitation of the people of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, it's first necessary to understand why this order was created.
The era in which all these events occurred is generally called the High Middle Ages, and this was during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD) in European history.
The period before the High Middle Ages is called the Early Middle Ages, and the period after is called the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500 AD.
Technical determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas, ranging from technological advancement or technological necessity to a serious mindset that assumes human life is governed by a logic driven by scientific laws, and that technology permeates every aspect of life.
Those who understand technological determinism well generally put forward two ideas: that technological development forges its own path, rising above cultural or political influences, and also that technology, in turn, leaves its "impact" on the society that internalizes it, rather than on a society conditioned by its social conditions.
For example, someone might say that the need to develop roads arises because of cars.
However, the road network spread throughout the country is not only economically necessary for a few cars, which is why new methods of car manufacturing are being developed to reduce the cost of buying and maintaining a car.
When a very large number of people buy cars, the number of accidents on the roads could also increase. Because of this, the need for the development of new technology is felt, so that the cost of repairing damaged cars can be reduced.
Naturalism contains an element of cultural determinism derived from writers like Goethe, Schlegel, and others of refinement.
In the context of environmental determinism, geography shaped people according to its nature, and over time, customs and cultures associated with that geography were born. These new customs and cultures, arising from the specific characteristics of the place, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws on society.
Just as Paris is currently known as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was considered a hub of luxury and comfort, and this status lasted from around 400 BCE to about 1100 BCE.
Its influence roughly began to decline in the twelfth century because the Crusaders were sending back the precious gifts they brought, such as silk cloth and spices. The reason behind this was that their price was so high that it was not possible to sell them in the Byzantine market.
This was the time when Paris began to take the place of Constantinople, which was known as the fashion capital.
Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, these fabrics were greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, communication mediums were slow at that time, so Western styles lagged behind the East by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. One of the major events of that time was that, due to religious wars, people started using buttons to fasten their clothes tightly.
Subsistence farming is a type of agriculture in which farmers grow crops solely to feed their families.
Subsistence farming is common and mostly organic farming, where seeds of crops grown in that very place are used. To obtain maximum yield, crop rotation or other simple methods are employed.
Historically, many farmers were involved in subsistence farming, and such farming still occurs in several developing countries.
A subculture is a group of people with similar ideas who are overlooked based on societal norms. Subculture gives them an identity.
The age, caste, class, location, and gender of subculture members can vary.
The characteristics that can differentiate a subculture can be language, interests, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of these and other factors.
Members of a subculture display their membership in a distinct and symbolic way. These symbols can take the form of fashion, style, or manner of speaking.
The most common way to understand the importance of socialization is to learn about some unfortunate children who, as they grew up, were mistreated by adults, or were not given attention, or were not socialized.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are restrained or tied up by people (often their parents); in some cases, these children are abandoned by their parents because their intellectual and physical development has not progressed properly.
The orphaned children had already endured much abuse and trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have raised animals, while others are believed to live alone in the jungle.
When a feral child is completely raised by non-humans (animals), that child's behavior is almost entirely (within physical limitations) like those animals, especially the animals that cared for them, such as being afraid of or indifferent to humans.
Project-based learning is easy and more fun, but scaffolding is a step ahead of that too.
Scaffolding is not just a way of learning, but it also helps people who want to learn something new, like a computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher can be scaffolding, just as a small paperclip man in Microsoft Office can be scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolding is the internal workings of software that aims to ask questions, provide hints, and explain the methods that a student would have difficulty understanding alone.
These children are sent to care centers due to several reasons, such as neglect, mistreatment, and even abuse.
No child should grow up in an environment where there is no nutrition, care, and education, but children are growing up in such environments.
We consider the daycare center a safe place for such children.
Our childcare system should be one that is loving, caring, provides stable educational arrangements, and reliable health facilities.
The care center should provide all the necessary things that the children had before coming here.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
Due to the distinctly unique characteristics of the internet, a different perspective emerges regarding its use and personal satisfaction.
For example, "education" and "socialization" are considered very important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
When Aimie and McCord (1998) investigated audience reactions to websites, they found that "personal connection" and "attempts to further relationships" were also a new kind of motivation for the Internet.
Video recording has enabled many useful discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions and facial movements that occur on the face for brief moments.
Specifically, if someone can accurately understand the subtle micro-expressions that appear on a person's face, they can tell whether or not that person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, "The President's Speech," explained that people who cannot understand spoken words due to brain damage can still discern the truth of something.
He went so far as to say that even pet dogs possess the ability to understand human behavior.
A research conducted in the 20th century revealed that genetic variation is of two types: hidden and exposed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and natural selection removes it from the pool of available variation.
Segregation and recombination cause the difference between the two pools to fluctuate back and forth in each generation.
In the savanna, the amino acid requirements of primates with a human-like digestive system are difficult to meet from the local vegetation.
The consequences of not fulfilling this need are serious: stunted growth, malnutrition, and premature death.
The leaves and pods of the most easily available plants can provide protein, but primates like us cannot digest them raw either.
However, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) can be easily digested without any problems and also provides a higher quantity of essential amino acid-rich protein.
After considering all of this, there's no surprise that our ancestors also fulfilled their "protein needs" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Waking up in the middle of sleep and falling back asleep after a short while (10-60 minutes) is a normal process.
This task can be easily done with the help of a low-volume alarm clock. The clock will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you have a habit of snoozing your alarm clock in your sleep, then the clock can be placed in the opposite corner of the room. This will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm technique involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which are considered diuretics) before bed, which will cause you to have to get up to urinate in the middle of your sleep.
The amount of peace a person has within is inversely proportional to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less stress there is, the more positive thinking there will be in life. Everyone can keep themselves completely calm and satisfied.
Every person can achieve Nirvana. It's just that inner stress and negative thinking make attaining Nirvana difficult.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Lord Buddha, which expanded through the Mahayana branch's path of love and Indian Yoga Shastra.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. They include Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the principle of love for all.
In Kundalini yoga, yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and philosophy are used to awaken the Kundalini energy (the energy of knowledge).
In the practice of Tibetan meditation, divine yoga is of primary importance. Through visualizing different deities, energy is purified, chakras are awakened, and wisdom consciousness is awakened.
In the Second World War, Germany was an enemy of both the USSR and the United States, which led to an alliance between them. After the war ended, the countries separated due to clashes in systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the war ended, old friends had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
This went on for the next 40 years, and this war was actually fought between different proxy armies in fields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had been shattered, leaving only the hope of retreating and regrouping along the Romanian front.
However, in a single night, all these plans were ruined when, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and several other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union invaded the eastern regions of Poland, penetrating the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts.
The best way to transport goods and people across the ocean is by ship.
The traditional job of the navy was to ensure that the people and goods of the country were transported properly from one place to another and to disrupt the enemy country's ability to do the same.
A recent prime example of this was the WWII campaign in the North Atlantic. The United States was trying to transport people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, Germany was trying to stop this traffic by using U-boats.
If the Allied forces had lost, Germany would have likely conquered Britain because the rest of Europe was already under its control.
It seems that goat domestication first began around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They started keeping old culture and tribal people for easy access to their milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Goats that are raised are often kept in herds and roam on hills or grazing lands. They are mostly herded by young children or slightly older children, who are known today as shepherds. This method of raising animals is still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
Earlier, wagons simply had wooden planks facing each other, but horses could pull them faster on rough roads and carry more weight.
The use of crossties to hold the rails in place started a long time ago. But, gradually, it was realized that the track would be much better if there was an iron strip on top.
This has become a common occurrence, but the iron wheels wore down the wooden wheels of the wagon more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rail was introduced.
Walking was the earliest form of transportation. Humans started walking upright from the beginning of Homo erectus (meaning humans walking upright on two feet) 2 million years ago.
Before them, Australopithecus couldn't walk upright in this way.
Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago show evidence of bipedal specialization, but Sahelanthropus, dating back 7 million years, may have already been capable of walking on two legs.
We can start living in a way that causes the least amount of damage to the environment, we can participate in the environmental movement, and to some extent, we can also be activists to reduce future suffering.
In a way, it's like treating the symptoms in many cases. But, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It has become absolutely clear that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advancements of mankind, and the problems have further increased due to the large population and the extraordinary lifestyles of mankind.
On July 4th, after Congress adopted it, a handwritten draft was signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, and sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, a few blocks away, for printing.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies of it were produced, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
On July 8th, John Nixon read it aloud to everyone for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington around July 6th, which he read aloud to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on July 10th.
The Dunlop Broadside has 25 copies still existing, which are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider it a dinosaur because it has wings and can fly.
But even now, there is much in birds that resembles dinosaurs.
They have clawed and pawed feet, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded as binary numbers.
In a binary number, there can only be one value out of two, 0 or 1, and to use computer terminology, these are called binary digits or bits.
The poison inside won't be detected immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are very common and won't immediately reveal its presence.
The best way to identify a potential spread of poison inside is an open container of medicine or any poisonous household chemical.
Refer to the label affixed to the container for specific first-aid instructions for any particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense to refer to specific groups of insects.
This word is derived from the bed-bug word that was used in common parlance in ancient times. This bug is also adept at thriving and growing on the human body.
Assassin-bugs and bed-bugs, both insects are called nidicolous because they remain permanently where they are born (on the host's body).
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research suggests that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that having a child is not in their or the child's best interest.
This couple can decide to give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to see how the world works in a scientific way. Most scientific research is actually guided by this very method.
It's not just used for that; experimentation and experiments are tests that eliminate one or more potential hypotheses. It directs scientific research by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on old and high-quality books, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West's connection to Greek philosophy and science ended.
The body's physiology encompasses numerous rhythms and behaviors that often depend in a very specific manner on internal cycles generated by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that don't just depend on external periodic signals have been noted for most living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is an oscillator that maintains itself and completes its cycle by running on its own time, even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was a key piece of evidence suggesting that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they used radioactive phosphorus to label DNA in one phase, and radioactive sulfur to label protein in another phase.
Depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cell is a germ-line cell or not, mutations can have many different kinds of effects.
Only mutations occurring in germ-line cells are passed on to children, mutations elsewhere either cause the cell to die or lead to cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy seeing plants and animals in the wild.
Examples of activities that can be done in that place include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying the ecosystem.
An example is seeing an orangutan in Borneo, taking its picture, and learning about it.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to their workplaces, passing by those whose workplaces are there where they have just come from.
Everyone in the mobile transport sector is connected in some way or another and supports a personalized, car-based transport system.
Science indicates that due to the large carbon economy, the biosphere, which has contributed to human development for the last two million years, has shifted from its stable state.
Every person participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality issues or bridge collapses in this manner.
Why does the transport system give room for such complaints, why does it fail on a daily basis? Are the transport engineers completely incompetent? Or is there some other fundamental reason for this?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy.
But fortunately, the driver behaves within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, there is some reasonable stability in the traffic stream and it can be roughly represented mathematically.
To effectively illustrate traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three key elements: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This collaboration will help in the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings back against their bodies.
It expands into small places for them to hide from hunters.
Nowadays, there's only one insect that can't fold its wings back, and that's the dragonfly and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This seems right, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving. What do you say, does it move?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes becoming up to six miles wide.
The Amazon River accounts for twenty percent of all water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the work of building pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical construction.
The people of the New Kingdom in ancient Egypt were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were already a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official correspondence.
Italian is also an everyday language that is used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in their native form in nature and can be easily mined from the ground with the help of primitive tools.
A philosopher named Aristotle gave the theory that everything is made of one or a mixture of more than one of four elements. These four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
These are the four states of matter (in this order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they could transform into entirely new substances and take forms that we can observe.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals too, like silver and gold.
Such alloys may also exist that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of some kind of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is so small that billions of them could fit inside the full stop at the end of this sentence.
Similarly, when the pencil was first made, people liked it very much.
It's a matter of regret that as new and new methods of writing are emerging, the status and use of the pencil is decreasing.
People now write messages on computer screens, which reduces the use of pencils.
It's something to think about what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
Nuclear bombs work on the principle that energy is required to hold multiple protons and neutrons together in a nucleus.
Like pushing a heavy vehicle uphill. The nucleus is broken apart again and some energy is extracted from it.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they break apart easily or without any pressure.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thin under Maria and thick under the Highlands.
The area nearby could experience more eruptions because the crust is thin. It's easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on discovering what people like or what they are interested in.
This theory explains that people have certain desires and/or needs that become part of their personality as they become adults.
This theory considers why people desire things and what in their environment causes them to do or not do something.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two popular content theories.
Generally, when managers get the opportunity to lead their former peers, two types of behavior can be observed. One of these could be being seen as "one of the team".
Managers like this often struggle with making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
In another type of behavior, the person who becomes the manager turns into a completely different person. He feels that he needs to change everything the team does and that he needs to have his control over everything.
Because the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This kind of behavior often creates a rift between leaders and the rest of the team members.
The quality of work of virtual teams is measured using the same standards as the evaluation of traditional teams, but there are some slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact for their physical teams.
Compared to members of traditional teams, they often have more freedom because their team can meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization choose such a time-consuming approach to building a learning institution? One goal of implementing the organizational learning concept is new transformation.
When an organization effectively utilizes all the resources present in its working departments, it can facilitate the flow of creativity and simplicity.
For example, when organizations work together to overcome obstacles, a new approach is developed to meet customer needs.
For any organization to function innovatively, it's essential that its leaders foster a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a way through which organizations can function more effectively.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical investigation of cognition, thereby narrowing the scope of exploration and making it more precise.
Understanding the relationship between the pathology of the brain and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that damage to the brain, injury, trauma, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technology has provided an opportunity to observe and examine the brain's structure and its functioning in ways that were never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for creating simulation models that help in understanding how the brain works.
While AI has many different meanings in science fiction, AI is an important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and the adaptation of intelligence.
AI research is done to create machines that can autonomously perform tasks requiring intelligence.
Such as, controlling, planning and creating programs, handwriting, voice, and facial recognition along with the ability to understand the cause of consumer problems and respond to them.
This has become a separate subject altogether, which emphasizes providing solutions to problems that occur in real life.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in software for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often, a teacher likes to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual field trips. Students can sit in their classrooms and view museum artifacts, aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing virtual field trips is also a great way to consider and share experiences on future trips with the class.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state's capital, and while the website is redone every year, the old versions are kept online like a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. However, students sometimes write incorrect grammar and spelling in their blogs at the beginning, but the presence of readers generally changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging together "provides students with more information about the world around them." It inspires students to write blogs that are good and interesting to readers, increasing reader interest (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond traditional classroom education.
The proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to content found on the internet, students can define their own position in relation to the writing of others, and simultaneously outline their own opinion on specific issues (O'Reilly, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's alluring, bilingual capital, home to numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south, the beauty of nature extends from Niagara Falls to Muskoka and beyond to the north.
This and many other reasons make Ontario the best place in Canada for outsiders.
In its north, a vast area has a very low population, and some parts are almost completely uninhabited jungle.
This comparison, which surprises many, is this: The number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is still the largest and a continent in its own right.
Most of the small islands are independent nations or associated with France, and they are all known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and they extensively occupied Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, this area is bordered by the coast, and in the south and west, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman, regardless of her actual marital status, should say that she is married.
Wearing rings can also be very helpful (not just the ones that look very expensive).
Women should understand that due to cultural differences, what they consider harassment may be a normal thing, such as being followed, or having their hand held, etc.
Show no hesitation in rejecting men and stand firm on your word without any fear (Whether the culture is different or not, this is in no way right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, abandoning it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt this city as Dar al-Beida, and Spanish traders, who established a trading base there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least favorite places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of trinkets, but it's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located to the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Goma ship was destroyed due to the Nyiragongo volcano. This volcano turned the roads of the nearby city and the city's main area into rubble.
It's generally safe to move around in Goma city, but if you want to travel outside of it, first do some research about the surrounding areas and understand that there is a conflict situation in the North Kivu province.
This city is a base camp for climbing Mount Nyiragongo volcano and other smaller mountains in Africa for mountain gorilla trekking as well.
In Goma, you can take boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around. For short distances, you will typically have to spend ~500 Congolese Francs in local currency.
With its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for a foreign, faraway land.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, but due to its reputation, it is a center of attraction for tourists. It also has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
During Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World," it was one of the major stops.
This city is the complete opposite of all other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic character than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park is spread over 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a flagship within the South African National Parks (SANParks).
All South African National Parks have daily conservation and entry fees.
A Wild Card can be beneficial for someone who wants access to any of South Africa's many South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region, and many tourists consider it a major focus for visiting this place.
Hong Kong's skyline of towering buildings has been compared to a magnificent bar chart, made all the more striking by the presence of Victoria Harbour's water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that was adopted by the British colonialists, and so if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending up to 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area of the forest that falls within India is called Sundarban National Park.
This forest is not just a mangrove swamp; it also contains some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by water/swampy areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that the area is now home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
All buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and those heading towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Most of the buses operating in the district are usually full, so it's better to book your tickets a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese coaster buses are running; they are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers have a height of 83 meters. It is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical drop below the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge was supposed to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint was expected to be abolished.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous group living in eastern Paraguay today, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice agriculture to subsist.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous peoples and other groups like the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born from the conflicts between Spanish men and indigenous groups.
The Spanish colonial period started, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for being one of the best polo teams and having some of the best players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place at the Las Canitas polo field.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
Visit the Asociación Argentina de Polo for tournament news and information on where to get tickets.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at a 1:1 ratio.
This island has only one bank where currency can be exchanged. This bank is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West Store.
British pounds are almost universally accepted on the island, as are major credit cards, and United States dollars are often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, but British and US currency may be taken; check with owners beforehand to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
Exchanging Falkland currency outside the islands is nearly impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity can make it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
Here, there aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, one should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other animals.
It doesn't matter how saintly they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and all sorts of large animals can attack us.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so keep your distance from them.
Please be mindful that carrying fragrant food items attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying them and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1950 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
Except for one British cruiser, all the ships sank. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the freedom struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of Paramount Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to the merging of two harbors. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beach located on the northern shore (in the North Harbour district) lies in the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Here, almost all the beaches are sandy, making swimming safe, and most beaches offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
Located on the Waitemata Harbour, amidst Tamaki Drive, lies the bustling suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Occasionally, this beach gets very crowded with families, with a line of really nice shops set up along the shore. Swimming here is considered very safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'; it's not a complex beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
There are several French wines here, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might be better.
The local tap water is completely safe, but if you're worried, bottled water is readily available.
Australians aren't familiar with 'flat white' coffee. A short black is called an 'espresso', a cappuccino cup comes filled to the top with cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but very delicious.
Reefs are visited somewhat year-round, and it is rare for a reef to be damaged by it for any reason.
Even so, consult with officials, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near the sea coasts and river mouths from October to April in the north since 1770; however, they can sometimes be found outside of this time as well.
Sharks are also found, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their primary habitat is north of Rockhampton, in river estuaries.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing that when they reach their destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agents often have good deals on specific hotels, but with the help of your travel agent, you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, flights, and hotel stays.
If you need time to think about the offer, or if you need to gather some more documents for where you are going, the agents can put your booking on hold.
Although any modifications or requests should ideally be made through the travel agent first, and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of people attending music festivals decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to Ukiriya, then you have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the main part of the music program is over, there might be some parts of the celebration where music continues to play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, because passing through the ice is quite a terrifying noise that affects most people.
The St. Petersburg cruise itinerary includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos commonly make many attempts to increase the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exiting can be difficult.
To keep guests in a good mood and accommodate them on their premises, they usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment options.
Alcohol is served in some places. However, alcohol impairs judgment, and good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or through mountain passes should be aware of snow and freezing temperatures.
Friction is reduced on icy or snowy roads, and you can't drive like you do on clear asphalt roads where you might skid.
A blizzard can dump a lot of snow in a very short time, which can trap you.
The visibility decreases due to snowfall, fog, and ice accumulating on the window panes.
On the other hand, in most countries, icy conditions are normal, and traffic flows smoothly throughout the year.
In Africa, safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction and the most popular for many tourists.
The word "safari" is most popular for underground travel specifically on the savanna to see African animals.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, come to the edge of the forest and can be easily seen with standard equipment.
Lions, tigers, and leopards are sometimes a bit shy, and you can see them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") involves a long walk, which can last for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.

If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, this could be a difficult situation for you.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies are not extended beyond the end of March until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event ticket prices will be between 2,500 and 130,000 yuan, with exclusive tickets priced around 7,000 yuan.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards upon request, even if they are not already in the room.
If a clothes iron is not available, or you don't like wearing socks without ironing them, then you can use a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful that the iron doesn't get too hot (because of this, the clothes can shrink or even burn sometimes).
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are very effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a short time is enough, but in some places, it takes several more minutes.

Travelers may encounter insects or animals that they are not used to seeing in their home region.
Insects and pests can spoil food, and they can cause itching in the body, as well as serious problems like allergies, poisoning, or infections.

The Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions, often passing through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you're not used to driving on this country's roads, be aware of your limitations: steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are very common.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections - typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to it is very important.
It is noteworthy that mobile phone service is more effective here compared to many sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and diverse, similar to the southern neighbor, Austria.

Stirrups are for supporting the rider's feet and hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide more stability to the rider, but safety concerns may arise due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting caught in them.
When a rider is thrown from a horse, and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they will be dragged along as the horse runs. A lot of safety precautions need to be taken to reduce this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear shoes that are very smooth and have very narrow soles.
In another instance, some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety bar that releases the leather-covered stirrup when the rider falls and the saddle is pulled backwards.
Cochamo Valley – This is a major climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring large granite walls and crags.

Downhill snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered areas with skis or with a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major traveling activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," and many people plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – because cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport began as early as the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia in 1861 by Norwegians. As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related to alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering but doesn't incorporate them, because alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering is done in deep terrain and requires very stiff skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as a hiking route.
If the conditions are good, you'll be able to cover a bit more distance than walking - but only very little, without a heavy backpack, will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but it has many independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling to many countries would mean having to go through the visa application and passport control process many times.
Actually, the Schengen Zone acted somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you reside in this area, you won't need to go through passport control checkpoints again to cross the border.
Like this, with a Schengen visa, you won't need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member country, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique piece. Some tax agencies define an item older than 100 years as an antique piece.
The definition of an antique piece varies in different places; for example, the age limit for an antique piece may be lower in North America compared to Europe.
In some cases, a handicraft product can be defined as an antique piece, even if the age of that item is less than that of other similar items.
Deer farming is an important source of livelihood among the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for many people in other businesses.

If you are traveling to a country that becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may wish to seek advice from other sources besides the government, but keep in mind that their advice may be tailored for their own citizens.
As an example, an American citizen in the Middle East might face a different situation compared to one in Europe or the Arab world.
An advisory is only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The ideas presented are often cursory, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.

Pre-operative transgender people should not be expected to go through scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are powerful, narrow channels of water flowing away from the beach, often breaking through the lines of incoming waves or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a strong current can form in the deep water.
Most deaths result from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible, leading to exhaustion.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than normal.
Try to swim to a place where you won't get caught in the current again, or, depending on your skill level and whether anyone has noticed you, you might want to wait for the rescue team.
Re-entry shock hits faster than culture shock (the enjoyable time here ends quickly), the effect of this shock on the mind lasts longer and can be dangerous.
A traveler who quickly embraces new cultures may find it very difficult to readjust to their own culture upon returning home.
After living abroad for a long time and returning home, you have adopted the new culture and forgotten the habits and customs of your own country and home culture.
When you went abroad, perhaps people showed a lot of patience and understanding, because they knew that a traveler needs time to live in and adjust to a new country.
It's possible that people may not realize that patience and understanding of the situation are also necessary for travelers returning home.

The island is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
The rest include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooding of an active volcanic caldera still creates a spectacular natural harbor.
It is located to the south of the Ellsworth Land Peninsula, which is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into plateaus, then re-emerge to form the 360 km Ellsworth mountain range, separated by the Minnesota Glacier.

Finland is a great place for boating. This "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands scattered across archipelagos amidst a multitude of lakes.
Having a boat at the archipelago and the lake isn't necessary for you.
Scattered archipelagos and the largest lakes located on the seacoast are great for yachts, yet the pleasure of exploring with a smaller boat or kayak is completely different.
In Finland, a favorite pastime is boating, where each boat typically carries seven or eight people.
It is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).

Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany. As you can see from a map of Berlin, it's not located near the sea and travel to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before and have not experienced any traumatic events.
This is not something to be ashamed of; it's no different from other things like personal fears and dislikes that many people have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help dispel the fear of the unknown or of things that are out of their control.
Courier companies are well-paid to deliver goods quickly. Often, time is of the essence with business documents, commercial goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Some routes have their own aircraft for large companies, but it has been a problem for small firms and other routes.
If they send the goods by air freight, it could take a few days to clear customs and duties on some routes.
The only way to get it quickly is to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules do not allow you to send baggage without you going wherever you are going.
The best way to travel in first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money to enjoy its amenities (or, better yet, do it at your company's expense).
However, it's not cheap: one thing is certain, you'll have to be prepared to pay four times more for business class and eleven times more for a first-class seat compared to a regular economy fare!
The point is that if you want to fly directly from A to B in business or first class, forget about getting any discounts.
Airline companies know that some air passengers don't hesitate to spend money like water for a comfortable journey and convenience, and that's why airlines charge a lot of money.
