And also, Ring gave money to a security company, ADT Corporation, which wanted to take him to court.
A drug that is being tested has reduced the number of people dying from Ebola. Up until now, no drug has clearly demonstrated that it can cure the disease.
A treatment that uses antibodies, called ZMapp, initially showed promise in curing the disease, but later studies found that it was not as effective at preventing death as originally thought.
When they conducted a test called PALM, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared how well other treatments worked against it.

This shows that some dinosaurs really did have feathers, an idea that many people hold, but this gives information that fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the color of this animal's fur is 'chestnut-brown' on top and 'pale' or 'carotenoid-colored' on the underside.
This research also provides some insights into how bird feathers develop.
Because the feathers on dinosaurs did not have a well-developed shaft, which is called a 'rachis', but they had two other things in their feathers—'barbs' and 'barbules'—the researchers concluded that the 'rachis' developed later than these dinosaur feathers.
The structure of these bird feathers shows that their function is not just for flying but also for regulating body temperature and for displaying their color to others. The researchers who led this discovery believe that even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, this sample shows the feathers of an adult dinosaur and not the feathers of a baby dinosaur.
The researchers involved in this study believe that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, it shows that feathers on adult dinosaurs were not as dense as the feathers on juvenile dinosaurs.
A bomb in a car exploded at the main police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They discovered that the Sun shares the same fundamental characteristics as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system, which they identified as 'luminosity' and 'rotation', causes them to rotate, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to find the Rossby number of a star, and this is related to plasma flow.
If the Rossby number is small, the star's magnetic reversal will not be very active.

The 802.11n standard operates on two frequencies, 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz.
This allows it to work backwards with 802.11a and 802.11g, which can happen if the base station has dual radios.
The speeds of 802.11n are faster than previous frequencies, and the theoretical maximum throughput is 600Mbit/s.

This work was done to develop some ideas, but they wrote this program to show the things they saw in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The thing that this team is working to find is the forces of attraction between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way galaxy that are creating it.
Just like the moon has a force that pulls the earth towards it, causing the tides, the Milky Way also has a force that pulls the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy towards it.
Scientists haven't been able to agree on whether 'dark matter' interacts with other 'dark matter' in the same way that all 'matter' does.
This scientific idea suggests that a lot of dark matter in a galaxy surrounds the galaxy like a halo, and this halo contains many small particles.

The government has promised to provide several million vials of encephalitis vaccine, which will prepare health agencies to work in the new year.
Plans to provide these vaccines to areas with a history of many pig populations getting sick this year did not happen because there was not enough money, and it was not considered a priority when compared to other diseases.

In France, the act of voting doesn't involve technology: voters go to a table, put a pre-printed ballot showing their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After the officers have checked the voter's name and place of origin, the voter will put the envelope into the ballot box and sign their name on the list of people who have come to vote for their candidate.
French election law states that the code used in the candidate selection process must be made public.
From 1988 until now, all ballot boxes must be in a clear and open space where voters and scrutineers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting, and that no other envelopes are added to the envelopes already counted, and that everything comes from those authorized to vote.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the afternoon, volunteers count the votes, and there are people who follow procedures to supervise their work.

Some roads were damaged, there is no train service in the areas affected by the earthquake, and Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture remains closed.
A bomb exploded outside the Governor-General's office.
Three more bombs exploded near government buildings within two hours.
Some reports say that the number of people who died is eight, and reports from offices say that 30 people were injured; however, the actual number is not yet known.
Cyanuric acid and melamine were found in urine samples from pets that died after consuming the contaminated pet food.
These two compounds react together to create crystals that can block the kidneys from functioning properly, the university researchers said.
The researchers observed that these crystals formed in the urine of cats when they were exposed to melamine and cyanuric acid.
The composition of this crystal is the same as that of samples found in the urine of animals that ate this food, as determined by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
I don't know if you realize this or not, but a lot of cargo coming from Central America enters the country 'duty-free'.
However, eighty percent of our cargo is subject to tariffs in Central American countries.
I can't understand this clearly; it's not right.
I want to tell the people to treat us the same way we treated you.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill into law that prohibits people from selling, renting, or gaming (violent games) to children.
This bill states that violent video games sold in California must be marked with a decal reading "18", and anyone who violates this law will be fined $1000 for each violation.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, made an announcement this morning stating that Huhne and Pryce will be prosecuted.
Huhne resigned and Ed Davey MP will take his place in the Cabinet. Norman Lamb MP will take over the job of Business Minister that Davey will leave.
The time for Huhne and Pryce to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court is February 16.
The deceased are Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was driving the car.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his upper arm and jawbone, and Kristoffer Schneider will need reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned during the fight when he pointed it at the fifth man's head. Schneider felt pain, one side of his face was paralyzed, and parts of his skull and face were made of titanium.
Schneider gave a testimony in a video at a USAF center in his country.
Following the race held on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed individually in two other races at these Championships.
His first race was in Slalom, where he got a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 out of 116 participants got the same result in that race.
In her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the 'women's sitting group' with a run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place finisher Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 behind the ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four women skiers in the women's sitting group did not finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 athletes skiing in the Giant Slalom did not receive a rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the laptop and mobile phone that were stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and took her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the people who caused this problem are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that these men covered their faces when they appeared in court.
Even though three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver of the car suffered serious head injuries.
The road where this crash happened was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was in James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
And then they sent him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court and was charged with the murder of her son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but an eyewitness's evidence won't change anything because his story has already been published in the news.
This happens all over the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have viewed the publication of the photos as something that expresses the opinion of some people and is not true.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said that "journalists can put themselves in danger if they publish photos and things like that of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, has told journalists that there will be no further comment until indictment.
The information that was made public discussed the border disputes, where Palestine wanted the borders that existed before the 1967 Mideast War.
Other topics discussed in the report include the status of Jerusalem as a holy site for both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the valley for ten years after signing the agreement, while the PA agrees to end military usage for only five years.
The shooters involved in this supplementary pest control test are rangers who are being watched, because this test is being monitored and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
Acting Director of Parks, Conservation and Heritage, Mick O'Flynn, and NPWS stated that these four shooters selected to conduct the first shooting operation have received good safety briefings and training.
Martelly swore in nine members of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the former Electoral Commissioner resign as part of the country moving towards new elections.
This commission was something Martelly did because of the anti-regime protests that were happening everywhere and started in October.
These protests sometimes lead to anger and fighting, and they are happening because there haven't been elections, some of which were supposed to happen in 2011.
Approximately 60 reports have surfaced regarding iPods malfunctioning due to overheating, resulting in six fires that caused minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan says it is aware of 27 accidents caused by this device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more cases of overheating, which the company described as "not significant."
The ministry expressed its opinion, calling Apple's practice of not providing timely reports "very unfavorable."
This earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office says that there has been no damage within the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there are no signs showing that a tsunami will occur.
A Filipino man who used to work as a police officer held hostage tourists from Hong Kong when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
They recovered some of the people he was holding, but six of those people died.
Six of the people he was holding hostage, including children and the elderly, were released first, along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of a large woman because she wanted to go to the toilet. They shot Mendoza with a gun, and he died.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and took up work in the field of medicine.
She received training to become an obstetrician and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labour during his own time.
His research showed that if they give a hormone, this can make the fetal lung of the baby grow faster.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators found the two 'black boxes' that record information inside the plane.
Other wrestling communities have expressed their condolences for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna is the number one Queen of Extreme. She was my number one manager. Luna left us on a night of two moons. This is strange and just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna used to do all sorts of things like me... maybe she surpassed me... loved her and miss her... I believe she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people who gave their opinions before the 2010 election, the proportion of those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent compared to the 2008 figure.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II finishes her reign.
Thirty-four percent of the people in this poll have the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last queen of Australia.
At the extremes of this poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic quickly, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
This man who won the gold medal is supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints about fitness, they don't know if he will play.
He was unable to get the drugs he needed to reduce his pain because the Games had banned those drugs.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number on January 25th.
Some groups have been using various hardware and software since the beginning of February to check if this is correct, and they announced it on Tuesday.
It seems that comets brought some of the materials that created Earth's water along with other organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand clearly how planets form, especially how Earth formed, back when comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, started his job as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He spoke about empty words, saying "political rhetoric is the practice of foolish people."
They thought that he wanted to run again for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save many millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions into the air.
He uses satellite-based technology instead of ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft properly and provide good information to pilots.
There will be no other transport available on the ground and trains that normally run above ground will stop at Wembley, and the park-and-ride facility will not be open.
The fear of not having transportation makes it seem like this game will be played in a place where supporters can't go.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science provides information about a new species of bird found in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported on a new species that emerged within two generations, but they believe this process, which usually takes much longer, occurred because of breeding between the medium ground finch (Darwin finch) of that area, Geospiza fortis, and the large cactus finch from another area, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into various shapes. And they can roll it and create very tiny shapes.
They can pull it and make it become a small wire, which they can twist and tie. They can hit it with a hammer or roll it and produce sheets.
They can grind it into a powder, making it very fine, and then apply (stick) it to other metals. Sometimes they grind it into a very fine powder and use it to decorate pictures that are painted by hand and in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is what they call the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical is.
The hydrogen marker (the H in pH), specifically the 'ion' within the chemical being tested, will indicate the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze them and make a ball.
The water on your hand will react with the outer layers of your skin, which will feel strange and create a kind of cell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet that used water in almost every house, and they were connected to a unique sewage system.
Remains of these sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Rome, toilets were part of public bathhouses where men and women would gather together.
When you call people who are thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
This satellite in space received the call and sent it back down very quickly.
This satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view of things.
They use a giant rocket, longer than 100 feet, to put a telescope in space.
This wheel has changed the world in many ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is given us easier transportation that moves faster.
He gave us trains, cars, and many other transportation machines.
Below them are mid-sized cats that hunt mid-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
In fact, there are many small cats (including those we keep as pets) that eat small prey such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret to how they manage to thrive is this thing they call 'niche', a special job each cat does and doesn't compete with others for.
Lions are cats that like to live with other cats, and they live together in large groups called prides.
Prides usually consist of about three adult males, along with around four adult females and their young.
The women all come from one family, like a large family of sisters and their daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, these animals being similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and they also pose a significant threat to the animals they prey on.
A good athlete, a tiger can climb (though it's not a very good climber), swim, jump to great heights, and pull things with a strength that is five times more than a man's strength.
Tigers belong to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but it's almost like a sentence of a man gasping for breath as he angrily shouts.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots find are smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find other animals to eat (try to eat) by smelling where they have been; they pick up their scent from the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with 'night vision', and also, they move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their food by hiding with things in the environment and jumping on the animal they want to catch.
When a small group of animals (a small number) leaves a large population from which they came (if they move up a mountain or to a small stream, or if they move to a new island and find it difficult to return) they will find themselves in a different environment that is not the same as before.
This new environment has diverse resources and diverse competition, so this new population will need different ways to become stronger than they were before.
This other population hasn't changed, but they need to make the same changes to their environment as before.
After some time, this new population began to change and learn to live in their new environment, and they started to look slightly different from the other population.
As time goes on, and after some thousands or millions of years, these two populations will look completely different such that one would not say they are the same 'species'.
We call this process 'speciation,' which means the creation of new species. Speciation is something we cannot avoid and is an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that we humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that we humans exhale (that is, when the air we breathe in comes out).
Plants make their own food in the sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our houses and make our clothes. Many of the foods we eat are plants. If there were no plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasauruses were the top predators of that time, no other animal could eat them, so they weren't afraid of anything. They were only afraid of other mosasauruses.
Its mouth has more than 70 teeth that are as sharp as razors, along with another set of teeth that are on the roof of its mouth. This means that anything it catches will not be able to escape.
We cannot be sure, but it probably had forked tongues. It ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and probably ate people too.
It eats everything that goes into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex wouldn't be a match for it.
While we know about many of the foods they ate, the Romans had foods that we don't know about or that they used during grand feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rat called dormouse.
Another strange thing is that while poor people eat their simple meals sitting on chairs, rich people like to have big feasts where they lie on their sides and eat.
The people of ancient Rome did not have foods from America or Asia that are now common in Europe hundreds of years later.
One example is that they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the people from ancient Rome had ever tasted a turkey.
The people of Babylon built a primary temple for each of their gods, which they treated as the god's dwelling place.
The people will bring offerings to the gods, and the priests will try to fulfill the needs of the gods during ceremonies and major religious festivals.
Each temple had an outside courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers shaped like pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
On top of this tower are some special places belonging to this god.
In hot places like the Middle East, housing is not important.
Many things in the lives of Hebrew families happened outside the house.
The women usually cook food outside next to the house; the stores are tables that are open and face the road. They use stones to build the houses.
There weren't many large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Not many people live in Greenland. According to old Norwegian stories, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland because he killed a man, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
But even though he discovered the place, there were already Eskimos living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that they wrote a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence paper.
However, that's not true. Even though there's something written on the back of a document, it's not a treasure map.
These words were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence paper "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". This writing is at the bottom of the document, and it's upside down.
Because no one knows who wrote these passages, it is understood that when it was new, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it looks like this piece of text they wrote later will be able to serve as a 'label'.
The D-Day landings and other battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
This area was controlled by the "Vichy" French. These were the French people who made 'peace' with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the people who came to occupy their country, and they didn't fight against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, in a battle they called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French soldiers liberated southern France and began advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, and it's a society.
The word 'civilization' comes from the Latin word 'civilis', which means 'civil', and is related to the Latin words 'civis', meaning 'citizen', and 'civitas', meaning city or 'city-state', and this also refers to the size of a 'society'.
City-states are entities that can form a country. Within a civilizational culture, people pass on their knowledge to generations, a kind of cultural footprint that remains and a way of imparting knowledge to others.
Often, small cultures disappear quickly and leave no evidence of their history, so scholars do not see them as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government—where Congress was only one component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy and collect taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it had to rely on state authorities, who often did not cooperate with it, to enforce its acts.
And also, he does not have the authority to change the tax law and tariffs between the states.
The articles need all the states to agree before they can make changes, and the states took over the central government, so the representatives they appointed didn't stay.
The national football team of Italy, along with the national football team of Germany, are two of the best teams in the world, and they were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The sports that many people know are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are well-known by many people in the Northern regions, and Italians participate in them in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has 7,000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, people often call Japan, geographically speaking, an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors passed by it and recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a center in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated a shift in grain production as they employed Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, soldiers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied and seized the 'western' and 'northern' coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three major structures, called Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings located around this structure were rebuilt to help tourists understand what the structure looked like in the past.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been rebuilt and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the 'still image photography' format that many people are familiar with is 35mm, which was the primary size of 'film' after the time of 'analog film'.
They made it themselves today, but more importantly, it's about the aspect ratio which the digital camera image sensor format captures and uses.
The 35mm format can be confusing because it has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (they divide it by twelve to get a simplified whole-number ratio) and they say that ratio is 3:2.
Many of the formats that people use (for example, the APS family of formats) are the same or very similar to this 'aspect ratio'.
The "rule of thirds," which many people misunderstand and joke about, is a simple guideline that helps create good photos and bring some order to an image.
He said that the best place for a subject to be during a photo shoot is where the lines visually dividing the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally, intersect (see example).
During that time, the Catholic Church had a lot of money and power, so they examined it very closely.
For over a thousand years, this Christian religion has united the countries of Europe, despite their individual languages and customs.
His great power brought change to all people, from the king down to the common people with no name or status.
One of the core beliefs of Christians is that they should use their money and possessions wisely to help others who are suffering or in need of money and food. They believe that church funds are for this purpose.
Rome had been at the forefront of looking after the work of the church for thousands of years, and a lot of power and money was located in Rome. This caused many people to doubt whether it was fulfilling this belief, or not.
Shortly after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
Their plan worked well, they stopped the important supplies from reaching the military and the people, even though this blockade violated international law established under agreements from two centuries ago.
Britain laid mines in international waters to stop ships from entering a large section of the ocean, which also endangered ships from other countries that were not involved in the war.
Because there was no response to this tactic, Germany thought the same thing would happen to its submarines.
In the 1920s, there was a widespread trend of citizens and countries seeking peace, unity, and independence.
Having witnessed the pain, suffering, and madness of war that arose from World War I, countries desired to avoid such a thing happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different time periods; each stage of China or each family that held power was a dynasty.
Also, in between dynasties there were periods where provinces were independent. One of these periods that many people know about is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times, great conflicts arose among many of the families who had status and power, fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a period of war in ancient Chinese history where many thousands of people died fighting for the top position in the 'grand palace' in Xi'an.
There are many things happening in society and politics, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, and the rise of nationalism and the belief that a country belongs to its people and not just a single ruler.
And also, after the Revolution, opportunities opened up for everyone, allowing people with dreams and who work hard to do the good work they want to do.
This is similar to the military, because now they don't get rank based on their family's class, but they will get rank based on their behavior and what they are capable of doing.
The French Revolution inspired many working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was interested in things that were greater than the things of this life. He would go to a stone cave called "Hira'" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) to stay and contemplate.
This stone hole, which still exists, provides a clear picture of Muhammad's beliefs.
He stayed on one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, this stone cave was hidden from all parts of the earth.
Truly, it's not easy to find him or know if he's alive. When you're inside that stone cave, you're completely isolated from everything else.
You can't see anything else but the clear, beautiful sky above, surrounded by many mountains. You can't see or hear anything of this earth when you're inside this stone hole.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built in the third century BCE by the Egyptians, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramid structures ever built to honor a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest of all is the 'great pyramid'), some smaller tombs, some temples, and the 'Great Sphinx'.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow mark" looks like a V and the "down bow mark" looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
"Up" means you start at the tip of the bow and push it, and "down" means you start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a softer sound, and a down-bow is a sound that is stronger and has more force.
You can make your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the bowing marks that are already printed there are there for a reason, so you must respect them.
On the 6th of October 1789, the market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris while they were staying in Versailles.
Inside a carriage, they fled back to Paris as large crowds of angry people surrounded them, shouting and making all sorts of threatening remarks against the King and Queen.
The large angry crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the windows of their carriage open.
Once, a man in the large crowd raised and displayed the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the Queen, and she was terribly frightened.
The money for the war that the U.S. started when it wanted to control and take the Philippines, the Filipino people themselves paid for it.
They forced them to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to provide money for expenditures and interest on bonds that they used under the name of the government of the Philippines within the banks of Wall Street.
It is true that the great profits that arise when they exploit or destroy the Filipino people will create the profits for the U.S. to dominate other parts of the world.
To properly understand the Templars, we must properly understand the background story that led them to create this group.
This period of time when these things happened is known as the High Middle Ages in European history, during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
Before the High Middle Ages, there was the Early Middle Ages, and after it, there was the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
'Technological determinism' is a concept with various interpretations practiced by people, ranging from 'technology push' or 'technological imperative' to the idea that human behavior on Earth is about following the laws of science and creating technologies that adhere to these scientific laws.
Many understandings of 'technological determinism' have two key ideas within them: one is that technological development follows a path that culture and politics cannot change, and the other is that technology causes "change" in communities because of inherent behaviors and attitudes, not that technology creates them.
For example, we can say that cars create the need for people to build roads.
However, a road that goes to every part of the country would waste money because there are only a few cars, so new ways of making cars are emerging to lower the price of cars.
When many people have cars, many accidents can happen on the roads, and this will cause people to develop new techniques in healthcare to treat injuries to the body.
Romanticism had a significant element of 'cultural determinism' within it, an idea that came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, a person's place of origin shapes their character, and over time, the customs and culture associated with that place emerge, better reflecting the identity of the people than laws imposed from elsewhere.
In this way, Paris became the leading place for various clothing styles in the world today, but Constantinople was the leading city for clothing styles during the Middle Ages in Europe.
Many people know about it because it was the origin of a good lifestyle and it began around 400 A.D. and ended around 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, its value decreased because the Crusaders had returned and they brought gifts such as silks and spices. The value of these things was higher than the value of things that were in the Byzantine markets.
During that time, the title 'Fashion Capital' was taken from the city of Constantinople and given to the city of Paris.
Gothic style became prominent during the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Originally, this dress followed the style of Byzantine Eastern culture.
However, because communication takes time, Western styles lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own styles. One of the major developments that arose during this time, partly due to the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that people do to produce food for their family's needs.
Subsistence agriculture is a system that doesn't use many resources, doesn't use chemicals, uses seeds obtained from crops that grow in the region, and they combine these practices with crop rotation or other simple techniques to make food grow abundantly.
In the past, many farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this practice still exists in many undeveloped countries.
Subcultures bring together people who share similar ideas and feel that societal standards don't belong to them, and when they come together, they create their own identity.
Subcultures can vary due to age, place of origin, social status, location, and gender.
The things that make subcultures different can include language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, location, or a combination of these things.
Members of a subculture can show their membership by using a particular style, such as the clothes they wear, their attitude, and the way they talk.
One method that many people use to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use stories of children who were poorly socialized because their parents were not attentive to them, bad things happened in their lives, or they were abused while growing up.
These kinds of children are what people call "feral" or wild children. Some feral children are kept at home by certain people (often their own parents); sometimes the parents don't pay attention to the child because the child has something wrong with their head or body.
Feral children are those who have experienced significant trauma or hardship in the past, leading them to run away or be neglected by their parents.
Other "feral" children are those who people say were raised by animals in the bush; some are those who people say lived alone in the bush.
When animals raise these children, these feral children show behaviors (that they are able to do) that are similar to the behavior of the animal that raised them, such as fear or not knowing what to do when they are with other people.
Never mind, project-based learning makes the learning process easier and stimulates interest, scaffolding does even more.
Scaffolding is not just a method of learning something, but it is a support that helps individual students who are learning something new, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can exist on a computer or physically in a classroom; another way to say it is that a teacher is a scaffold, but the "paperclip man" in Microsoft Office is also a scaffold.
Scaffolds in computers are within software and their purpose is to ask questions, advise on what to do, and explain ways to do things that are difficult for students to do on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and forcing children to do things to earn money.
No child should be in an environment that is not good for them, does not care for them, and does not educate them, yet they find themselves in such environments.
We see the Foster Care System as a safe place for these children.
Our Foster Care System is supposed to provide safe places for children to live, families who can love and care for them, and good health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything that they didn't have in the home they were taken from.
The internet combines personal communication with mass communication.
These internet practices provide new knowledge about how we can use the internet and have fun.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are important motivations that make people want to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
"'Personal involvement' and 'continuing relationship' were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new factors that motivate us to use the internet when they studied people's behavior on websites."
The use of video recording has allowed experts to discover important things regarding the meaning of 'micro-expressions', facial movements that occur within milliseconds.
Furthermore, they say that we can find out if a man or woman is lying by correctly identifying their 'micro-expressions'.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech," showed how people might not be able to fully understand the meaning of speech because they have some brain damage, but they can clearly understand if someone is being truthful.
He also said that this kind of understanding of human behavior, animals also have it, like the dogs we keep as pets.
Research from the twentieth century showed that there are two pools of genetic variation: one that is hidden and one that is obvious.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination cause this variation to fluctuate between two pools within each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to obtain sufficient amino acids from the plants available there.
And more so, if they are unable to do these big things from happening: 'growth depression', 'malnutrition', and the biggest one is death.
This plant that grows in this area has protein in its leaves and beans, but it is hard for the stomachs of primates like us to break down, so they must cook it first.
Another thing is that animal-based foods (like ants, termites, and eggs) are easy to eat, and they also provide a high amount of protein that contains all the amino acids the body needs.
When we consider everything, we shouldn't be surprised if their ancestors solved their "protein problems" in a similar way to how "chimps" on the "savanna" do today.
Sleep interruption is the practice of waking up in the middle of sleep and going back to sleep a short time later (10–60 minutes).
This is something you can do when you use a 'quiet alarm clock' to wake you up gently and not startle you awake.
If you find yourself hitting the snooze button on your alarm clock, you can put it on the other side of the room, this will make you get out of bed to go turn it off.
Another 'biorhythm-based' option is to drink plenty of water (like water or tea, a 'diuretic') before you sleep, this will force you to wake up and go to the toilet.
The feeling of peace resides within a person who has connection, but it is the opposite of the burden that resides within a person's body and spirit.
When problems are small, there will be more positive force in life. Everyone has the strength to find true peace and happiness.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this idea is our own suffering and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism follows the teachings of the Buddha, but it has expanded them with the "Mahayana path of love" and also with many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Within its core philosophy, Tibetan Buddhism is actually very simple. It contains Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, this Kundalini energy ('enlightenment energy') awakens within 'yoga postures', breathing exercises, 'mantras' and 'visualizations'.
The primary element within Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy pathways are purified, chakras are activated, and mental enlightenment arises.
Germany was an enemy of many groups in World War 2, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. When the war ended, a divide emerged between the systems, processes, and cultures, and this prevented the countries from working together.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This war will last for 40 years and the fighting will be very real, involving armies representing countries, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses collapsed, and the only thing to do was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were ruined that night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created a front in Belarus and a front in Ukraine after they entered and seized the eastern regions of Poland, and this action violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements that existed between the two countries and also between many other countries.
Using ships to transport goods is the primary way to move large quantities of cargo or people across the sea.
The job of the navy is to ensure that your country is able to move cargo and people, and also to stop enemies from moving their cargo and people.
A good example that happened recently was the North Atlantic campaign in WWII. The Americans were trying to move cargo and men across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, was trying to stop this from happening.
If the Allies hadn't done what they did, Germany probably would have overpowered and taken Britain, like it did to all of Europe.
People started keeping goats around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to make it easier to get their milk, grass (likely meaning pasture/grazing), meat, and hides.
The goats that people care for are often put into groups that roam small mountains or other areas to find food, often watched by goatherds, who are usually children or young men who are referred to as shepherds. These methods of caring for goats are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
Even though 'wagonways' were planks placed on either side of the road, they allowed horses to pull loads faster and haul bigger cargoes on smoother surfaces than regular roads of the time.
They used crossties first to hold the tracks in place. Later, they realized that the tracks would be better if they had a piece of iron on top of them.
This is a common practice, but it causes wear on the wheel flanges of wagons.
Later, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. In 1767, they made the first 'full-iron rails'.
The first form of transportation was walking; people started walking on two legs two million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means 'upright man') appeared.
The early hominids, the Australopithecus, did not walk on two legs all the time.
Bipedalism has been found in fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, but Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in harmony with the environment, we can join an environmental movement, and we can become activists to reduce the potential for future problems.
Often this is the same as 'symptomatic treatment'. However, if we don't want a short answer, then we must find the root cause of the problem, and we must stop them.
It is easy to see that the world has changed greatly because of new scientific knowledge and technology, and the problems are growing because of the large population and people's lifestyles of having all sorts of big things.
After Congress received the document on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlop's nearby printing shop.
Around the middle of the night, they would make something like 150 to 200 copies, and these were called "Dunlap broadsides".
The first time this document was read to the public was when John Nixon read it outside Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy appeared in London on August 10th.
25 Dunlop photocopies are still available, and they are very old copies of this document. The original handwritten document is damaged.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they are like dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that look similar to dinosaurs still.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today store and process information using binary code.
A binary number can have two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or 'bits' in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning might not become obvious quickly. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are major signs when it's difficult to make a diagnosis quickly.
The clearest sign that 'internal poisoning' has occurred is an open container of medicine or a household 'toxic chemical'.
Check the label for first aid instructions on the poison.
The term 'bug' is used by entomologists to refer to that group of insects.
This phrase gets its meaning from bed-bugs, those insects that are parasites on people.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they stay in the place where they were born or on something that provides them with food.
Across various parts of the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A married couple might decide that it is not good for them, or not good for their child, if they have a baby.
These types of couples can decide to put their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights as parents so that another couple can care for the child.
The goal of science is to find out how the world works by using the scientific method. This method guides much of scientific research.
It's not just about being yourself, 'experimentation', and an 'experiment' is a 'test' that is used to eliminate one or more of the ideas that have been developed; questioning and conducting studies also guide 'scientific research'.
Scholars of nature and philosophy study classical texts, such as the Bible in Latin.
The things they agreed upon were Aristotle's ideas on science, along with psychology.
As the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West lost the Greek ideas about science and philosophy.
Many scientists have observed that the rhythms that occur in the bodies and behaviors of animals and humans follow external cycles and the body's biological clock.
These 'periodic rhythms', which don't just arise from external factors, have been studied and observed in many living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are things that maintain themselves and generate electrical currents, and they continue to run even when the external factors that cause them to run are not present.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the things that showed that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments where they labeled the DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus or they labeled the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a variety of things, and they occur because of the type of mutation, the important function of that piece of genetic material, and whether these cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations that occur in germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in seeing natural areas and enjoy observing the landscapes, along with the plants and animals of that area.
Examples of on-site activities include fishing, taking photos, bird watching, and touring the parks to study information about the ecosystem.
One example is to travel, take photos, and learn about orangutans when you go to Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural town when they get into their cars to go to their workplaces, passing other people whose workplaces are in the town they are leaving.
Inside this transport shuttle, everyone is connected, and they support a transport system that private cars create.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy is pushing the biosphere away from a stable state that supported humanity for the past two million years.
Everyone lives in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you wouldn't hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate these kinds of complaints, and why don't they work well every day? Are the transportation engineers not doing their jobs properly? Or is there something bigger happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and how they interact with each other.
However, the study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior is something that cannot be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
However, drivers tend to behave in a consistent manner, so traffic has some consistent patterns, and experts can demonstrate this with mathematical figures.
To improve traffic flow, relationships must be established between three key factors: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to live in the air. Their ability to fly helps them escape their enemies and find food and mates very easily.
Many insects can fold their wings close to their bodies, and this is a good thing.
This allows them to have many small places to hide from animals that want to eat them.
Today, the insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people think he is right, but many people believe the opposite; they believe that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, along with the Sun (and other stars too).
This seems right, because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river on Earth. It carries water with a volume eight times greater than the second largest river.
Also, the Amazon is the largest river in the world by discharge, and its average width is six miles.
20 percent of the water that comes from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small streams.
Although the practice of pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and skill of those who built the pyramids of Giza.
The Egyptians of the New Kingdom thought that these buildings of their ancestors were truly strange, at a time when these pyramids were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. This is the smallest country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and for official communication.
The Italian vernacular was also used daily by people working within the state, and Latin was used for church ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People knew about major chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper in ancient times because they found them in the environment in their 'native form' and they were easy to find with ancient tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the idea that everything is made up of one or more of the four elements mixed together. These elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (and follows the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. It also says that they change and create new things to make the things we see.
Alloys are things that contain two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. There are other metals too, like silver and gold.
You can have alloys that contain small traces of non-metal elements like carbon in them.
Everything in the Universe is made up of 'matter'. All 'matter' is made up of tiny things called 'atoms'.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, and trillions of them would fit into a full stop at the end of a sentence.
Therefore, the pencil has been a good friend to many people since it came into existence.
However, when new ways of writing emerged, the pencil took a back seat and wasn't used as much.
Now people write notices on computer screens, and they don't come close to a pencil sharpener anymore.
We can think about what will happen to keyboards when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works by following the principle of taking energy and creating a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like you're pushing something very heavy up a small hill. The process of "splitting a nucleus" also releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they break apart easily, whether you touch them or not.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
Its crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner in the coastal areas and thicker in the highlands.
It looks like there will be more 'maria' on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It's easier for lava to come to the surface.
Content theories attempt to identify what things motivate people.
These theories state that people have certain needs and desires that are present within them as they grow up.
These theories look at what internal factors within people make them like the things they do, and what environmental factors will cause them to do something or not do something.
The two 'content theories' that many people know are the Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
If we analyze everything, two approaches become clear when managers start to lead their peers. On the one hand, they want to remain "one of the boys (or girls) in the group."
This kind of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, discipline employees who break the rules, review employee performance, delegate tasks, and tell employees directly when they are wrong.
On the other hand, a manager comes in and becomes someone the team isn't familiar with, and who feels they have to change everything the team is doing and do everything according to their own will.
Ultimately, it's the leader's job whether the team performs well or not.
This behavior causes problems between leaders and teams.
Teams that work together on computers can have the same standards for doing good work as teams that work together in the office, but there are some small differences.
Teams that collaborate on computers work like individuals who coordinate groups working in the office.
Teams that work in the office have more autonomy compared to teams that collaborate across time zones, something local managers often fail to grasp.
A truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique phenomenon found within teams that collaborate using computers.
This "invisible team" is a management team where each member of the team reports to it. This "invisible team" sets the standards for each member to follow.
Why would an organization want to do work that takes a lot of time? This is about creating a learning organization. One of the main reasons for implementing 'organizational learning' within an organization is 'innovation'.
When the departments of an organization make good use of all resources, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Because of this, an organization's process of working together to overcome a difficult situation can lead to new and different processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can adopt new and innovative ways of doing things, leaders must create a culture of innovation and also foster a culture of knowledge sharing and collaborative learning.
Angel (2006) clearly stated that the Continuum approach is a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, making the research area more focused and precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
They have known for a long time that various kinds of damage to the brain, like traumas, lesions, and tumors, can change behavior and cause changes in thinking.
These new technologies that have emerged are helping us to see and investigate the structures and processes of the brain that we haven't seen before.
This gives us new information and material to create simulation models that can help us better understand the processes that occur within our minds.
Although AI might make people think of science fiction, AI has become an important area within computer science, working in the areas of reasoning, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves making machines perform tasks that are typically repetitive and require the knowledge of a worker to make decisions.
Examples include controlling things, planning and scheduling things, knowledge of answering customer questions, and recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
These kinds of things each have their own area of study, and they look at ways to provide answers to everyday problems.
Now they are using this AI system in the areas of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and they have used it to build some home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of the classroom. Teachers often like to take their students to places they can't just hop on a bus and go to.
Technology provides answers with 'field trips' that happen on the computer. Students can look at 'museum artifacts', see an 'aquarium', or view beautiful 'art' while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a "field trip" on the computer is also a good way to plan a trip and share what happened with the class later.
For example, each year the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, and each year the website gets a new style, but the old versions remain online like a scrapbook.
Blogs can help students to write well. Often students start their blogs with poor grammar and spelling, and when there is an audience reading them, they will change and write better.
Because students tend to complain a lot if something is not right, the student who writes the blog will start writing well to avoid criticism that he doesn't write well.
"Also, blogging 'forces' students to learn more about the things that are happening in the community they live in." This need to satisfy the needs of the people who read their blogs makes the students more knowledgeable and become 'interesting' (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that helps people collaborate and encourages them to extend their learning beyond what they typically learn in a single day at school.
Using blogs in a good and correct way can allow students to analyze things and know what is not right and how to correct it; when they work with materials on the Internet, students can know where they stand when they analyze things that others have written, and they can also give their opinions on things that are happening (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada where people use two languages, and it has art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Far to the south is Niagara Falls and to the north is Muskoka, a beautiful place with other nice places as well.
Outsiders say that all of this, and more, shows Ontario as a place that truly reflects the colours of Canada.
Large areas far in the north are sparsely populated, and some places are uninhabited.
One surprising fact about population size: There are more African Americans in the US than there are total citizens of Canada.
Eastern African Islanders are those who live in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is very big, and it's like its own continent when you look at it from a wildlife perspective.
Many of the small islands are independent countries, or are part of France, and function as luxury beach resorts.
And also, the Arabs brought Islam to these places, and it became the major religion in Comoros and Mayotte.
The culture and ideas of Europeans and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Route during his journey from Europe to India.
The northern part of the region is surrounded by the Sahel, and partially to the west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It's better that women who go to that area say they are married, even if they are not really married.
It's good to wear a ring (but don't wear a ring that looks expensive).
Women need to be aware that different cultural practices can cause what they perceive as harassment to occur, and that people might follow you, hold your hand, and things like that.
You must be strong and say no to people, don't be afraid to stand firm and speak up (that custom/behavior is a local custom, it's not right for them to do that!).
The city of Casablanca today was founded in the 10th century BCE by Berber fishermen, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as an important port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but they abandoned the place after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultans rebuilt this city as Daru l-Badya, and Spanish traders called it Casablanca when they established their trading posts there.
In all of Casablanca, it is one of the worst places to shop.
In the old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various trinkets, but all these things are for tourists to buy.
Goma is a city that tourists like to visit in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the eastern part, close to the country of Rwanda.
In 2002, the hot lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma and covered many of the city's roads, with the damage being particularly severe in the city center.
Even though Goma is relatively safe, tourists who visit places outside of Goma must find out and be well informed about what kind of conflict is happening in the North Kivu province.
This city is a place to stay while climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and tracking Mountain Gorillas. The price of these gorilla tracking tours is more reasonable than elsewhere in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The local price for these is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Another thing is that "Timbuktu" is hard to get to, and they use the name as a figure of speech for things that are different, located in a faraway place.
Today, Timbuktu is a town that doesn't have much, even though it has a good reputation that attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of 'world heritage sites' that are in danger, because of the damage occurring to its rock paintings in the desert.
It was a place where the PBS program Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World made a major stop and examined it.
This city is different from all other cities in the country because it looks more like an Arab place and not like an African place.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
This park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecozones, each of which supports diverse wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions that draws tourists to South Africa and is considered an important asset within the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are conservation and entry fees for each day in the parks.
It is good for someone to buy a Wild Card, which gives permission to enter all the parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gave Hong Kong its name and is a popular tourist destination.
The buildings that fill Hong Kong's skyline have been described as resembling a shimmering bar chart, with the shimmer being produced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The majority of developments on Hong Kong Island are concentrated along the northern coastline on reclaimed land.
This is the place where the British colonizers took possession, so if you want to see remnants of the colonizers from the past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, about 80 km (50 mi) deep from the Bangladeshi and Indian coastlines.
They announced that the Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This part of the forest is located within the territory of India, which is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangroves and swamps — they contain some of the last great forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of about 3,850 km², and one-third of it is covered by water/swamp.
In 1966, the Sundarbans was established as a sanctuary for animals, and it was estimated that there were 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses usually leave the inter-district bus station (which is located on the other side of the river) during the day, many of which are for those going east, and the Jakar/Bumthang buses leave the station between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because inter-district buses are usually full, it's a good idea to buy a ticket a few days before the departure date.
Many districts have a lot of Japanese Coaster buses running in them, and you'll have a comfortable ride.
Sharing taxis with other passengers is a good way to travel comfortably and quickly to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It is located on the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers start at a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't open to vehicles until March 2017.
This bridge was scheduled to open in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints were completed.
The Guarani are an important indigenous people who live in what is now Eastern Paraguay, and they hunt and trap animals, and also grow crops in gardens.
The Chaco region is home to other Indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunt, fish, and gather food they find in the forest.
In 16th century Paraguay, which was called "The Giant Province of the Indies," came into being when the Spanish came to dominate the indigenous people.
The Spanish started to control this area around the 3rd century.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has allowed many of the customs and cultures of indigenous groups to remain.
Argentina is known worldwide for having one of the best polo teams and polo players.
The major tournaments of the year take place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and games that people can watch are also held here about four times a year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), and its value is the same as one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on this island, and it's located in Stanley on the other side of the FIC West store.
You can use British pounds everywhere on the island, as well as Stanley credit cards, and you can also use United States dollars.
On the outer islands, they cannot use credit cards, although they can get British and United States currency; check with the shop owners to find out what methods of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so you should exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it experiences summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and then it changes again.
Montevideo is in the "subtropics"; in the summer months, its temperature often exceeds +30°C.
During winter, it can get extremely cold: the temperature doesn't usually drop below freezing, but the wind and moisture in the air combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There is no real "rainy season" or "dry season": the rainfall stays roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, they are still wild animals and people should not feed or disturb them.
Park authorities say that people must stay 100 yards/meters or more away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
Even though they may look calm, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can fight.
Every year, many visitors get injured because they don't stay far enough away. These animals are big, wild, and can become hostile, so give them their space.
Also, be careful of smells that attract bears and other animals, so do not carry or cook food with strong smells and keep the campsite clean.

If you don't know how to drive on roads outside the city, you must prepare yourself: there are places that slope downwards or upwards, there are narrow roads where there isn't space to run, and sharp corners.
Speed limits are generally lower than on other sections—often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and adhering to them carefully is more important than making exceptions.
We don't know why the mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other parts of this route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria, they have a great taste and variety, similar to those of the southern people, the Austrians.

Stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability to the rider, but they can create safety issues because the rider's leg might get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse, but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them while it runs away. To reduce the chances of this happening, riders must take steps to prevent it.
Firstly, many riders wear riding boots that have a heel and a smooth, long sole.
Another thing, some saddles, these are English saddles, they have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to fall down from the saddle if a rider falls backward.

Skiing is a recreational activity that people enjoy doing, and those who are called "ski bums" often plan their holidays around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of 'skiing' is very old – there are paintings in caves showing people skiing as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport goes back to around the 17th century or earlier, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
'Backpacking by ski': This activity is also known as 'backcountry skiing', 'ski touring', or 'ski hiking'.
It's similar, but they don't usually combine it with alpine style ski touring or mountaineering; that latter one is usually done on steeper terrain that requires sharper skis and boots.
Think of a "skiing route" as being the same as a "hiking route".
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover much larger distances if you ski rather than walk – but occasionally you'll experience the speed of cross-country skiing when you're not carrying a heavy pack in these ski areas.
Europe is a small continent, but it has many independent countries. Often, travelling to many countries there means you'll have to go through more visa applications and passport control than you would otherwise.
The Schengen zone is different; sometimes, it's like its own country.
If you are within this zone, you can cross the border and you will not have to go through the passport control checkpoint again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for visas for each individual Schengen member country, and this saves time, money and paperwork.
There's no universally agreed-upon definition of what "antique" means. Some tax agencies say that anything over 100 years old is an antique.

Handicrafts are called antiques, even though they are not as old as mass-produced factory items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important occupation for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this occupation is also important for other groups who have different jobs within their communities.

People who want to change their gender should not think that they will go under the scanner and their privacy will be hidden.
Rip currents are currents of seawater that break on the shore and flow back out to sea, often through a rip or something like that.
Because of the underwater topography, the returning water gathers in the deep areas, and a fast current going to those deep areas can form.
Many deaths occur because people find it difficult to try to swim back against the current, and this is hard to do.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back won't be difficult.
Try to swim to a place where the current isn't pulling you back, follow your swimming markers, and if there are people who see you, you can consider waiting for them to rescue you.
"Re-entry shock" happens faster than "culture shock" (it doesn't have a "honeymoon phase"), and it can last longer and can become more intense than "culture shock."
Travelers who find it difficult to adapt to a new culture also find it difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you live in another country and return to your home, you change your behavior to follow the new culture and you lose some of the customs of your own culture.

The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819, and multiple countries have claimed them and they have many research stations, sixteen of which were still active in 2020.
This group of islands is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island where people live in Villa Las Estrellas.
The others are Livingston Island, and Deception, a flooded volcanic caldera that is still active, give a similar view of this basis.
Ellsworth Land is a region located to the south of the Peninsula, and the Bellingshausen Sea surrounds it.
The mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula meet the high ground, then it opens up again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which the Minnesota Glacier divides into two.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, and Mount Vinson which is 4892 m high.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, you can only use a satellite phone.
A satellite phone cannot replace a mobile phone because you need to stand outside and have a clear view of the satellite in order to make a call.
This service is frequently used by ships, as well as pleasure craft and expeditions that need to use remote data and remote voice.
Your local telephone service provider will be able to give you more information on how you can connect to this service.
One thing that many people who are planning to take a gap year do is travel and learn something.
This is something many school leavers are doing, which involves taking a gap year before they go to university, and they are not stopping their education.

There will often be school fees to enroll in these education programs.
Finland is a great country for boating. This "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has many thousands of islands in its lakes and in the seas.
On small islands and lagoons, you won't need a yacht.

'Boating' or the activity of traveling by boat is something that all people in Finland enjoy doing. They have many boats, with each boat able to hold 7 or 8 people.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but slightly different (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is 40).
Many Baltic Cruises allow passengers to stay longer in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can see a city with its history in a few days, returning at night to sleep on the ship.

Some cruise lines claim in their brochures that they take people to Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have been involved in a previous aviation incident.

For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help them overcome fears arising from the unknown or a feeling of lack of control.
Courier companies pay well for delivering things quickly. Often, it's important to do this with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small businesses there has been a problem.
If goods are sent by cargo plane, on some routes it will take many days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to send something quickly is to send it as checked luggage. Airline rules don't allow bags without passengers, and this is where you come in to help.
The easiest way to fly in first class or business class is to spend a lot of money to get that nice service (or, better yet, have your company spend that money for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: often, you can pay up to four times more than the economy class price for a business class ticket, and you might pay up to 11 times more for a first class ticket.
There is no basis for asking for discounted prices on business class or first class on direct flights from one place to another.
Airlines are well aware that there's a group of people who are willing to pay a lot of money to travel quickly and receive good service on the plane, so they charge that kind of price.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language of this place is Romanian, but Russian is also used in many areas.
