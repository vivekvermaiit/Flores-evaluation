This not only confirms the widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal has chestnut-colored feathers on the top and pale or carotenoid-like colored feathers on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to understand the evolution of bird feathers more deeply.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed rachis (the "shaft" of a feather), but possessed other feather features (barbs and barbules), researchers inferred that the rachis may have evolved later than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers believe that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult dinosaur feathers, not juvenile feathers.
Researchers believe that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows feathers from an adult dinosaur, not juvenile feathers.
Yesterday morning's car bomb attack at the Gaziantep police headquarters in Turkey killed two police officers and injured more than 20 people.

The completed studies are mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for is caused by the tidal gravitational force between galactic dark matter and Milky Way dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravity on Earth creates tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way it affects ordinary matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a halo-like region around the galaxy and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said this new variant is "very disturbing and concerning because its mortality rate is very high."
Dr. Moore believes that some patients may have contracted the bacteria in the hospital, and at least two were hospital staff.
Within a year, one infected person could infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire TB patient population appears to remain low; in South Africa, at any given time, 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 are infected.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters fill in their chosen candidate on a pre-printed paper inside a polling booth alone, and then put it in an envelope.
After the staff verified the voter's identity, the voter placed the envelope into the ballot box and signed the voter registry.
French electoral law employs fairly strict criteria in drafting electoral procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside the box at the start of voting, and that no additional envelopes are placed inside except for those properly checked, authorized, and deposited by voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the election process. In the evening, volunteers count the ballots according to the designated procedures under strict supervision.

In the women's sitting class, four skiers failed to finish the race, and in the giant slalom event, 45 out of a total of 117 athletes failed to place.
The Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested the 5 people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendant's names are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendant appeared in court with their face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, luckily no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered a severe head injury.
The road at the scene of the car accident is temporarily closed to allow emergency services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital of Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, Adekoya was charged with murdering her son and stood trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.
She is being detained, awaiting indictment and trial, but because her photograph has been widely circulated, any eyewitness testimony may be compromised.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's legal system is different, and the courts believe that publishing photos may constitute prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out, "If reporters publish photos of suspects, etc., it seems like a dangerous thing."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is fully responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that it would not make further comments, at least before the prosecution.
According to leaked information, this document concerns border disputes, in which Palestine hopes to use the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders as a basis.
According to reports, other discussion topics included: the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan River issue.
After Israel demanded to sign a ceasefire agreement and continue stationing troops in the Jordan Valley area for 10 years, the Palestinian Authority only agreed to a 5-year deployment.
Shooters participating in the supplementary pest control trial will be closely supervised by forest rangers; the trial will also be monitored, and its effectiveness will be evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is partnering with the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) to recruit qualified volunteers to participate in the Sporting Shooters' Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, park conservation and heritage agent director for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to form a provisional electoral council (CEP) composed of 9 members.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a move to steer the country towards new elections.
This committee is Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-government demonstrations that began in October.
These protests were triggered by the lack of elections (some elections have not been held since 2011), and sometimes escalated into violent clashes.
There were approximately 60 reports of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that authorities have noticed 27 accidents related to the device.
METI announced last week that Apple had reported to them 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company considers "not serious."
The relevant department responded that Apple's delay in publishing the report is "truly regrettable."
The Mariana Islands earthquake occurred at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office indicated that the nation has not received any reports of damage.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami at the time.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the Philippine capital, and took them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with an M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been rescued, and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, and a Filipino photographer were released early.
Later, those photographers stood in for an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Likins followed in his father's footsteps and began a medical career.
He received training as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his time working at the hospital, Liggins began to use his spare time to study premature births.
His research shows that taking a certain hormone will accelerate the growth of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators discovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first extreme queen and also my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons, just like her, very unique and strong."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as quirky as me... maybe even more so than me... I loved her and I will miss her... I hope she's gone to a better place."
Among the 1,400 respondents interviewed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34% of respondents held the same view, hoping that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last monarch of Australia.
From an extreme perspective, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as three relay races, at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have cast doubt on his state of health.
He has been unable to take the medication needed to overcome the pain because these drugs are banned by the Olympics.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri in the United States, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
In early February, several people verified this discovery using different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because long ago comets collided with the Earth.
Fifty-three-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described these rumors as "political noise and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The US Federal Aviation Administration says the NextGen system can shorten flight paths for airplanes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than the outdated technology of ground-based radar, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport provided, the Overground will also not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks or Park and Ride facilities on the ground either.
Due to public concerns about a lack of transportation, the competition may be forced to be held behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published in the journal *Science* on Thursday reports the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that while evolution was previously thought to take a long time, a new species evolved in only two generations due to interbreeding between local medium ground finches (Geospiza fortis) and introduced large cactus finches (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be crafted into different shapes, and it can also be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin strands, then twisted and braided. It can also be pressed or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made into very thin sheets and glued onto other metals. It is sometimes even thin enough to be used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, which is called "gold illuminated manuscript."
This is called the pH value of chemicals. You can use purple cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color change of cabbage juice depends on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substances.
The pH value indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has had its electron removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two kinds of dry powders evenly, then use clean, slightly damp hands to squeeze them into balls.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer of the substance, resulting in a strange texture and forming a shell-like structure.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost all houses had flush toilets connected to sophisticated sewage systems.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in Minoan towns and houses on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, used by both men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space, after receiving a phone call, will almost immediately reflect it back.
Satellites are sent to space by rockets. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket needs to be over 100 feet tall to send satellites or telescopes into space.
Wheels have changed the world in extraordinary ways. The wheel's greatest contribution is that it has given us simpler and faster means of transportation.
It brought us trains, cars, and many other different kinds of transportation.
Below them are mid-sized felines, which eat medium-sized prey including rabbits, gazelles, and deer.
Finally, numerous small felines (including free-ranging pet cats) will consume a variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success lies in a proper division of labor, with each cat assigned a specific job, allowing them to avoid competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the cat species, living in groups called "prides".
A pride of lions consists of one to three related adult males, plus up to thirty females and cubs.
Females usually have close relationships, forming a large family that includes sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf packs or dog packs, exhibiting behaviors surprisingly similar to each other (but distinct from other large felines) and proving highly lethal to prey.
Tigers are all-around athletes; they can climb (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers and lions, leopards and jaguars are all animals of the same genus (Panthera). Among felids, only these four types can roar.
A tiger's roar is different from a lion's loud roar, and is more like a snarling growl.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds whenever possible. Almost all the animals that leopard cats hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that leopard cats use their sense of smell to find the exact location where prey has been on the ground in order to hunt for edible animals (prey).
Their night vision in the dark is very good, and they can move silently. Leopard cats hunt prey by first blending into the prey's surroundings, then pouncing.
When a small group of organisms (a smaller population) separates from the main population from which they were born (for example, crossing a mountain range or river, or migrating to a new island, and being unable to easily return after reaching their destination), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In a new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so this new group needs to develop different habits or adaptive abilities from before in order to become a stronger competitor than before.
The original groups haven't changed at all; they still need the same adaptability as before.
As time passed, this new group began to adapt to the new environment, and the differences between them and the other group became increasingly pronounced.
Finally, after being weathered by thousands or even millions of years, these two groups of organisms will look completely different and can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which is the formation of new species. Speciation is a natural consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants release oxygen that humans need to breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of that era, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
It has a long jaw filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, with extra teeth on its upper jaw, meaning nothing in its path can escape.
We aren't certain, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included sea turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even have eaten its own kind.
It also attacks everything in the water. Even a huge dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex couldn't match it.
Although most of their food is similar to ours, the Romans also had their strange tastes and unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the wealthy prefer to recline and eat together at banquets.
The food of ancient Rome could not have included ingredients that were only brought to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, the ancient Romans didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa beans, nor had they tasted turkey.
The Babylonians would build a main temple for each deity, which was regarded as the deity's home.
People offer sacrifices to deities, and priests try to satisfy the needs of the deities through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has an open-air courtyard and an inner sanctum that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes, pyramid-shaped towers, also known as pyramid temples, are built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for deities.
Because of the warm climate in the Middle East, housing becomes less important.
Most Hebrew people's family life took place outdoors.
Women cook in the backyard; shops are simply open-fronted counters facing the street; stones are used for building houses.
Because Canaan's territory had no large forests, timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and discovered the island while sailing west, naming it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at that time.
Although every country was once "Scandinavia," there are still many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map drawn on it.
But the truth is not so. Although there is some writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written, "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." This text appears inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, what is known is that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was originally stored rolled up.
Therefore, adding symbols is likely just for labeling purposes.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but southern France remained unliberated.
It was ruled by "Vichy" French. These Frenchmen made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France, this offensive was called "Operation Dragoon".
The US military and the Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks, and then turned towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a single culture shared by a large group of people (i.e., a society) who live and work cooperatively.
The term "civilization" originates from the Latin word civilis (meaning civil), which is related to the Latin words civis (meaning citizen) and civitas (meaning city or city-state), and that to some extent also defines the scale of society.
City-states are the predecessors of countries. A civilization and culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, the continuation of cultural footprints, and a certain degree of dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence, and are thus not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with only Congress as its sole component.
The congress lacked any power to levy taxes. Moreover, since a national executive or judicial branch did not exist at the time, the congress could only rely on often uncooperative state governments to enforce all laws.
Congress also has no power to overturn tax laws and tariffs between individual states.
The ordinance requires unanimous consent from all states to be amended, and these states do not value the central government, with even state representatives frequently absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are tied for second place in the world, and they are also the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, where Italians also participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
With close to 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), Japan is the 7th largest archipelago in the world!
Due to Japan possessing a group of islands, it is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
The origin of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began reforming the grain production methods of the indigenous people, and employed Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) army controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki. This treaty ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japan's rule over the island did not end until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of this architectural complex have been rebuilt, allowing tourists to better understand their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35mm is the most common still image photography format in the world, and it was also the most widely used size at the end of the era of analog film photography.
Although production continues to this day, more importantly, the aspect ratio was later adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The name of the 35mm format is a bit misleading; it's actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) can therefore be expressed as three to two.
Many common formats (such as the Advanced Photo System's format) also have this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The often-abused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that, while creating a sense of vibrancy, can still maintain order in an image.
It indicates that the most effective position for the subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image horizontally and vertically into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under intense scrutiny due to becoming wealthy and powerful.
For millennia, despite certain differences in language and customs, Christianity has kept the countries of Europe inextricably linked.
Its omnipresent power influenced everyone, regardless of whether they were a king or a commoner.
One of the core tenets of Christianity states that the purpose of wealth should be to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is why church funds exist.
The central authority of the Roman Church has a thousand-year history, and such concentrated power and money make many people question whether it conforms to its creed.
Following closely on the heels of the outbreak of war, Britain initiated a maritime blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective in cutting off essential military and civilian supplies, but this blockade violated international law established by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain deployed its forces in international waters, preventing any ships from entering the entire ocean area, posing a threat even to neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this strategy, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, most citizens and countries largely adhered to egalitarianism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities brought about by war during World War I, nations hoped to avoid a recurrence of such events in the future.
In 1884, Tesla immigrated to the United States and went to work for Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with four cents in savings, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Batchelor, his previous job's manager.
In ancient times, China had a unique way of indicating different periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there have been unstable periods of divided provinces. Among these periods, the most famous is the Three Kingdoms period of 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, many nobles engaged in fierce warfare while vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with countless people dying in the struggle to ascend the highest throne of the Grand Palace of Chang'an.
Numerous social and political influences emerged one after another, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the nation belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, all professions were opened to applications from all men, allowing the most ambitious and successful to inherit them.
The military has the same situation, because now military rank is no longer tied to class, but is determined based on ability.
The French Revolution also awakened many oppressed working-class people in other countries, starting their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to frequent a cave named Hira on Mount Noor (meaning "light") to meditate.
Caves, formed through the test of time, provided Muhammad with a distinct image of spiritual inclination.
Resting on the summit of a mountain in northern Mecca, this cave is isolated from the world.
In fact, even if you know it exists, it's difficult to find. When you're inside the cave, you are absolutely cut off from the world.
Here, you will only see the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. Looking out from the cave, you only see and hear a small part of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands.
The Great Pyramid was built by Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramids used to commemorate deceased pharaohs.
Located on the Giza Plateau (or "Giza Necropolis") in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to commemorate Pharaoh Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" marking looks like a V, and the "down bow" marking looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Upwards means you should start pushing the bow from the top, and downwards means you should start pulling the bow from the bow root (where your hand grips the bow).
Up-bowing usually produces a softer sound, while down-bowing produces a stronger and more solid sound.
Feel free to write down your own markings, but remember that printed bowing markings are there for musical reasons, so generally speaking, they should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a group of market women to return to Paris from the Palace of Versailles on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd roaring and loudly threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage.
A rioter suddenly waved the head of a royal guard, which had been severed in the Palace of Versailles, in front of the terrified Queen.
American imperialism conquered the Philippines, with the cost of the war ultimately borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, with most of the expenses and bond interest paid through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the surplus profits generated by the long-term exploitation of Filipinos will form the basic income of American imperialism.
Before understanding the Knights Templar, we must understand the sequence of events that led to its creation.
The event is often considered to have occurred during the High Middle Ages in European history, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a variety of ideas, ranging from technology push or technological imperative, to, in the strict sense, the belief that human destiny is driven by a deep logic related to scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common views: that the trajectory of technological development itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and that technology, in turn, inherently "impacts" society rather than being conditioned by it.
For example, someone might say that cars inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, if there were only a small number of cars, a nationwide road network would not be economically feasible, so new production methods would be developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Owning cars in large quantities also leads to more road accidents, which in turn brings about new technological inventions in medicine to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism has strong cultural determinism elements, originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geographical environment shapes the individual, and the customs and cultures related to the geographical environment emerge over time. Those cultural customs are more in line with the positioning of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion metropolis of Europe during the feudal period.
From 400 AD, it was known as a center for luxury goods, and this lasted until about 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status gradually declined, mainly because the Crusades brought back spoils such as silk and spices, which were more popular than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
From this time onwards, Constantinople relinquished its title as the capital of fashion to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak of popularity in the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The initial design of the dress was deeply influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication between the East and West, Western fashion trends lagged behind the East by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own clothing styles. The most significant development at that time came from the Crusades, which led to people using buttons to fasten clothes.
Sustainable agriculture advocates producing only enough food to feed farmers and their families.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system that uses seeds native to the local ecosystem and combines them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced sustainable agriculture, and this is still common in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring together groups of like-minded individuals who feel ignored by societal norms, and subcultures allow them to develop a sense of identity.
The uniqueness of a subculture can stem from the age, ethnicity, class, geographical location, and/or gender of its members.
The defining characteristics that set a subculture apart can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of different factors.
Subculture members usually express their membership through unique and symbolic means, including clothing, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite the cases of a few unfortunate children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their upbringing, did not receive social education from adults.
These children are generally referred to as "feral children." Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their parents), while other cases are due to parents abandoning them because they refuse to accept their child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Street children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some people are said to have been raised by animals, while others survive alone in the wilderness.
When a feral child is raised by non-human animals, their behavior (within the limitations of their body) is almost exactly like the animal that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Thematic learning should make learning easier and more interesting, and scaffolding theory takes it a step further.
Scaffolding theory is not a learning method, but a form of support to assist people who are experiencing new learning processes, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real. In other words, a teacher can be a form of scaffolding, and so can Microsoft Office's Clippy.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software, designed to question, stimulate, and explain procedures that students struggle to handle independently.
There are many reasons why children are placed in foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking care, love, and education, but these children are experiencing exactly that.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide them with everything that their previous home lacked.
The internet has elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The internet's distinct characteristics have broadened the scope of its uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998), in researching user responses to websites, identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as new motivations.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting fleeting micro-expressions and facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that accurately interpreting microexpressions can reveal whether someone is lying.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out that even people with brain damage who couldn't understand the content of a speech could still accurately judge the speaker's sincerity.
He even suggested that animals such as domestic dogs may also have that kind of ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that genetic variations are divided into two types: recessive and dominant.
Mutation adds new genetic variation and selectively removes dominant variation from the gene pool.
Separation and recombination alternate back and forth in the two gene pools of each generation.
On the savanna, primates (with digestive systems similar to humans) struggle to obtain the necessary amino acids from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure can bring about serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and even ultimately lead to death.
The easiest plant-based protein sources to obtain are from leafy greens or legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all of this, it's not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in today's savanna do.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep within a short period (ten to sixty minutes).
You can easily achieve it by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that makes you conscious without fully waking you up.
If you have a habit of snoozing your alarm in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices include drinking a lot of liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, which are known to be diuretics), forcing one to wake up to urinate.
The inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to their physical and mental tension.
The less nervous you are, the more positive the expression of your life force will be. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of awakening. The only thing that hinders progress towards this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but it has been spread through the love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques originating from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path towards great love.
Kundalini Yoga awakens Kundalini energy (energy of awareness) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualizing various deities, it purifies energy channels, opens chakras, and generates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, fostering cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, conflicts in systems, processes, and culture led to discord between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies now became enemies, and the Cold War officially began.
It will continue for the next forty years, and real wars will be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over eight hundred thousand soldiers from the Soviet Red Army, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invaded eastern Poland, entering and establishing the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using shipping is currently the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The traditional duty of the navy is to ensure your country has the ability to transport its citizens and goods, while also disrupting the ability of your enemy to transport their citizens and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II. The United States attempted to cross the Atlantic, transporting manpower and supplies to assist Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy mainly used U-boats to try to block transportation.
If the Allied forces had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain, just as it had conquered other European countries before.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around ten thousand years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats are usually herded in groups on mountains or other grassy areas, cared for by goat herders, often children or teenagers, similar to the shepherds we are more familiar with. These grazing methods are still in use today.
England built carriageways as early as the 16th century.
Although the paved road was only made of parallel wooden planks, compared to the somewhat rougher roads at the time, they allowed horses to travel faster and pull heavier goods.
Using railway sleepers to fix the tracks was introduced very early on. However, gradually, people discovered that adding a small piece of iron to the surface of the rails was more effective.
This evolved into a common practice, but iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. Full iron rails were first introduced in 1767.
The earliest known mode of transportation was walking, and with the emergence of Homo erectus (referring to upright humans), humans began walking upright two million years ago.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal adaptations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus tchadensis may have already been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can participate in environmental movements, and even become activists, to reduce the harm to the future to some extent.
This is just like prescribing the right medicine for the illness in many situations. But if we don't just want to temporarily solve the problem, then we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it from the source.
Clearly, with humanity's technology and techniques constantly advancing, the world has been completely changed. Due to overpopulation and humanity's excessively luxurious lifestyles, the problems have become even more serious.
After the Congress passed the bill on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing shop located several blocks away.
Made 150 to 200 copies overnight, and is now known as "Dunlap single-sided prints".
The document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon on July 8th in the front courtyard of Independence Hall.
A copy arrived in George Washington's hands on July 6th, and he read it aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A duplicate was sent to London on August 10th.
The 25 extant single-sided Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving versions of the document. The original handwritten manuscript no longer exists.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs managed to survive to this day. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
However, there are many things about birds that are still similar to dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information, and the encoding of information is in the form of binary digits.
Binary digits can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1. These digits are called binary numbers or bits in computer terminology.
Internal organ poisoning might not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are very common and don't allow for immediate diagnosis.
The clearest sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicine containers or toxic household chemicals left at the scene.
Check the label of the specific poison for specific first aid instructions.
The term "bugs" used by entomologists formally refers to this group of insects.
This term originates from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, insects that are perfectly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are both nidicolous animals, accustomed to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests, or not in the child's best interests.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their children.
In the adoption process, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. In reality, this method does indeed guide most scientific research.
Conducting experiments is not the only method; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more viable hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations can also lead to scientific research.
Natural historians and philosophers emphasized classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science (including psychology) were widely recognized.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the Western world became detached from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
The rhythms observed in many physiological and behavioral aspects are usually mainly determined by the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through physiological clocks.
Circadian rhythms are not only responses to external periodic cues, but are also recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is self-sustaining and oscillates, maintaining a free-running cycle for a period of time even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the important proposals arguing that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one labeling the DNA of bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus and the other labeling the protein of bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells, mutations can have a variety of different effects.
Only variations in germline cells can be inherited by children, while other variations may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism, with its appreciation of scenery including wildlife, is very appealing to nature lovers.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting the park, and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from the small towns to their workplaces, passing by those whose work destinations are exactly where they just left.
In this kind of dynamic transportation system, everyone is, to some extent, connected to and supported by the transportation system through private cars.
Contemporary science indicates that this large-scale carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from a stable state that has underpinned human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social activities and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
You rarely hear complaints of a similar degree about water quality or collapsed bridges in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems lead to complaints? Why do they break down every day? Are traffic engineers so incompetent? Or is it because there are some more fundamental problems?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and interact with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow research isn't easy because we can't predict drivers' behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, the driver's behavior tends to be within a reasonably stable range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have a certain degree of reasonable consistency and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationship between three key characteristics has been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the earliest animals to fly in the sky. Their ability to fly helps them avoid enemies more easily, while also more effectively finding food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backwards along their body.
This allows them to go to more small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many people believe the opposite, that the solar system (including the sun, even other stars) moves around the Earth.
Seems reasonable, after all it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's widest river, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
Of all the water on Earth that flows from rivers to the ocean, a full 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main channel is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, the scale and masterful construction techniques of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of the previous period, which were over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has a population of approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world in terms of both area and population.
The laws and official language of Vatican City are Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in that country, while Latin is more commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens within Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in their native forms in nature and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory stating that all things are made up of one or more of four elements. These four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (listed in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. But his theory also points out that different forms of these elements can transform into new substances, forming what we see before our eyes.
Alloys are basically mixtures made up of two or more metals. Don't forget there are many other elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are all considered metals. Of course, there are other metals as well, such as silver and gold.
Some alloys also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are extremely tiny, so tiny that the period at the end of this sentence can contain trillions of atoms.
Therefore, when pencils were introduced, many people saw them as good friends.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the status and frequency of use of pencils have declined.
People now type messages on computer screens and no longer need pencil sharpeners.
People can only wonder what will happen to keyboards when newer things appear.
The operating principle of a fission bomb is that it requires energy to bind together nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy handcart uphill. Splitting the atom again and releasing some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart even with slight vibrations or no vibrations at all.
The moon's surface is composed of rock and dust. The moon's outermost layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the front side and 100 kilometers thick on the back side.
The crust under the lunar maria is thinner; under the highlands, it is thicker.
Due to the thinner crust, the near side likely has more lunar maria, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying the reasons why humans do certain things or what will arouse their interest.
These theories suggest that certain needs and/or desires are internalized as people grow into adulthood.
These theories explore what it means for some people to desire to do certain things, and what factors in their environment cause them to do or not do those things.
Two widely known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a manager starts leading former peers, two behaviors may emerge. At one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys."
These types of managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning job responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum is the manager becoming a completely different person, who would feel compelled to change everything that is constant in the team and take full responsibility themselves.
Ultimately, the leader must be responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior can sometimes lead to disagreements between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are still slight differences between the two.
Virtual team members often function as liaisons to their direct, physical teams.
Because their teams can meet across different time zones, something that local management may not understand, they often have greater autonomy than members of traditional teams.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"Invisible teams" are management teams to which each member reports. Invisible teams set the standard for each member.
Why are organizations willing to spend time building themselves into learning organizations? One goal of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
Creativity and uniqueness are elevated when all available resources are fully utilized by functional departments within the organization.
Ultimately, the process of internal collaboration within the organization to overcome difficulties can lead to innovative processes that meet customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must establish a culture of innovation and promote knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
According to Angie (2006), continuous improvement is a method used to help organizations improve their performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approaches of cognitive research, thereby narrowing its scope and making it more accurate.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior confirms the scientists' research.
Since ancient times, people have known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in some psychological functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and study previously unseen brain structures and operational processes.
This provides a lot of information and material, allowing us to build a simulation model to help us understand how the brain works.
Although artificial intelligence has strong science fiction connotations, it remains a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptability.
Artificial intelligence research involves automating tasks that require intelligent behavior from machines.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and faces.
The aforementioned items have now become independent fields, each focusing on providing solutions to problems encountered in real life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been implemented in software applications for some home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of all teaching. Teachers often want to take students on field trips to places that buses cannot directly reach.
Technology offers virtual field trip solutions, allowing students to visit museum artifacts, explore aquariums, or appreciate beautiful artwork from the comfort of their classrooms.
Virtual field trips are also a good way to reflect on field trips and share experiences in future teaching.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is updated annually, but older versions are also kept online as a memento.
Blogging can also improve students' writing skills. Students often make careless grammatical and spelling errors when they first start blogging, but the presence of readers generally changes this.
Because students are usually the most discerning audience, the blogger will start working hard to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, the blog "Enhancing Students' Understanding of the Surrounding Environment" satisfies readers' interest needs, inspiring students to become smarter and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools used outside of school to inspire student collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional school days.
"Appropriate use of blogs can enhance students' analytical skills and critical thinking; by actively responding to online material, students can define their own positions based on the meaning of others' articles, and outline their views on specific issues" (Olaeweck, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, featuring a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north are the undeveloped natural beauties of the Muskoka River and other areas.
All of this further highlights Ontario, and is seen by outsiders as a typical Canadian place.
The northern areas are mostly sparsely populated, with some even being uninhabited wilderness.
This is a surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest continent to date and also a habitat for wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France, and are also known for their luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and carried out large-scale occupations in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism originated in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope route from Europe to India.
The northern region is surrounded by the Sahel, while the south and west are surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that any female traveler, regardless of marital status, say that she is married.
Bringing a ring can also help (just don't make it look too expensive).
Women should understand that certain cultural differences can lead to incidents being perceived as harassment; for example, being followed or grabbed by the arm are quite common.
When rejecting men, your attitude must be firm, don't be afraid to express your position (cultural differences are not an excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the tenth century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it in the name of Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt this city as Dar al-Baida, where Spanish merchants established a trading base and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of trinkets, but they're all targeted at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is located on the easternmost side, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. The lava flow covered most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
While Goma is relatively safe, research should be conducted before visiting any location outside of Goma to understand the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu province.
This city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and it has the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking service in Africa.
You can take a Bodaboda motorcycle taxi to tour Goma. Short trips normally (locally) cost about 500 Congolese francs.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for a faraway and exotic place.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its historical fame has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to the encroachment of desert wind and sand, this place was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger.
Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Africa's Great Civilizations" listed this place as one of its major stops.
This city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has a more Arabic flavor compared to African cities.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into fourteen different ecological zones, each providing a habitat for different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship park of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily conservation fees and park entrance fees.
There are also advantages to buying a Wild Card, as it allows you access to designated South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with Hong Kong and is also a focal point for many tourists.
The numerous skyscrapers that make up Hong Kong's skyline resemble a sparkling bar graph, appearing particularly striking against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour's waters.
If you want to enjoy the most beautiful scenery of Hong Kong, leave Hong Kong Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite shore.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the north shore.
This place was once occupied by British colonists and is a good starting point for finding evidence of colonial history on this territory.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The forest located in India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests here aren't just mangrove swamps; they also encompass the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The area of Sudanban is 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water/swamp area.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that the area now has 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses are available all day from the local bus station (across the river), but most depart between 06:30 and 07:30 (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang).
As inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas have small Japanese coaster buses for shuttle service, which are comfortable and stable.
Taking a shared taxi is a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby locations, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The twin towers are 83 meters tall, the bridge is 378 meters long, and it has two 3.50-meter-wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. It was completed in August 2011, but didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani people live in present-day eastern Paraguay and are the largest indigenous group in the region. They live as semi-nomadic hunters and also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua. They lived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "Province of India Gigantum," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous people.
The Spanish started a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has successfully preserved much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament takes place in December at the Lasa Cañitas polo grounds.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched for the remainder of the year.
For information about match updates and where to buy tickets for polo matches, please refer to the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP) at a value of 1:1.
Currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the archipelago, located opposite Stanley FIC West store.
Pounds Sterling are accepted anywhere on the island, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are generally accepted as well.
Credit cards are usually not accepted on the outlying islands, but they may accept British and American currency; you should confirm with the shop owner in advance what payment methods are accepted.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside the islands is almost impossible, so you should exchange currency before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
Winter can be deceivingly cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but with the wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons there: rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, these wild animals still retain their wild nature and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park regulations, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters from other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they fail to keep a safe distance from the animals. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please keep your distance from them.
Also, please be aware that smells attract bears or other wildlife, so please avoid bringing or cooking strongly scented foods, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven warships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain all refused to leave the harbor.
Apart from a British cruiser, all the ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
In the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland spans two harbours, the area has many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three main areas.
North Shore beaches (North Shore area) are located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of this area's beaches are suitable for swimming, and most of them are planted with New Zealand Christmas trees, providing shade.
Tāmaki Drive Beach is in Waitematā Harbour, located between Mission Bay in central Auckland and the affluent suburb of St Heliers.
This place is very popular with families who like to swim, and it can get quite crowded sometimes. There are many shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but it feels pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
You can buy a lot of French wine here, but the New Zealand and Australian ones might ship better.
The local tap water is very safe and drinkable. However, if you're worried, bottled water is also easy to find.
For Australians, a "white" coffee is a foreign concept. A short black is an "espresso", a foamy coffee has a high layer of cream (not milk froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although the juice is expensive, the quality is excellent.
Coral reefs are visited by many people year-round. Injuries on coral reefs, due to any of the above reasons, are rare.
Nevertheless, it's still important to follow the authorities' advice, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, box jellyfish frequent beaches and estuaries. Outside of this period, they can occasionally be found.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away on their own.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean. Their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows travelers to have accommodation as soon as they arrive at their destination, giving them peace of mind.
Travel agencies usually have partnerships with specific hotels, but you may also be able to book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through them.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, round-trip airport transportation, and even flight and hotel combinations.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to consider the quote or obtain other documents for the destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agency first, and not directly with the hotel.
At some music festivals, most attendees choose to camp on-site, and they consider it a necessary part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the event location, you should arrive earlier and find a camping spot near the music.
Remember, even though the music on the main stage might be over, some parts of the festival might still be playing music late into the night.
Some music festivals set up special camping areas for families with children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, because during the ice crossing, the cabins most affected will experience terrible noise.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions for details).
Casinos usually try their best to make customers spend the most time and money. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and the exits are also hard to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment arrangements to keep guests in a good mood and stay in the casino.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is lower, and you can't drive the same way as you would on ordinary asphalt roads.
In a blizzard, snowfall within a very short time is enough to trap you.
Visibility may be limited due to snowfall or blowing snow, or due to condensation or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, freezing temperatures and snow accumulation are common in many countries, and traffic is almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Hunting safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and a highlight for many travelers.
The term "safari" generally refers to observing stunning African wildlife via land travel, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to get close to vehicles, and standard equipment will allow you to see them clearly.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be quite shy, using binoculars makes them easier to spot.
Walk-up hunting trips (also known as "bushwalking," "hunting hikes," or "walking") involve hikes that can last for hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other regions within Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the last time being in 1964.
If you had already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies did not cover July 2020 (i.e., the original scheduled time of the Olympics).
Ticket prices for most events are expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with a typical ticket costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for loan, even if the rooms don't have them.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then if you have a hairdryer, you can try using that.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are many different methods of water purification on the market, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other places, several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies; if you have any concerns, you might consider buying sealed bottled water produced by companies with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter animals and pests that are not commonly seen in their hometowns.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people with force, do not usually meet the criteria to be considered pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to purchasing tax-free goods at specific locations.
Travelers can sometimes save a lot of money in countries with heavy taxes, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo–Pittsburgh Highway between Marion Point and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions, often traversing remote and rugged terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural country roads, please stay alert: it's mostly steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns here.
The speed limit is noticeably lower than the sections of road before and after, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the speed limit is given more importance than other things.
But the strange thing is, the cell service here is much stronger than many other stretches along the way, for example, the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are delicious, and Bavarian pastries are similar to those of its southern neighbor Austria, with a very rich and diverse range of styles.
Fruit pastries are very common, you'll see apples made into pastries year-round, while cherries and plums are frequent visitors in the summer.

Javanese cuisine is now ubiquitous throughout the archipelago, including a range of simply seasoned dishes, with Javanese people favouring peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various fragrant spices as their main seasonings.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but also pose a safety risk as the rider's foot may get stuck inside.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup and the horse runs off, they could be dragged. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riding boots worn by riders have heels and smooth, relatively narrow soles.
Secondly, some saddles (especially English saddles) are equipped with safety bars that allow the rider to pull backward when falling, causing the stirrup leathers to come off the saddle.
Chile's premier climbing destination—the Cochamó Valley, also known as the Yosemite of South America—boasts diverse, enormous granite walls and cliffs.
The mountain scenery is breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world continuously develop new routes along the endless rock faces of the valley.
Downhill skiing (including skiing and snowboarding) is very popular, and involves attaching skis or a snowboard to your feet and sliding down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts (sometimes referred to as "ski fanatics") whose entire holiday plans revolve around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport can be traced back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski mountaineering: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski trekking.
Although associated with alpine skiing or mountaineering, most do not involve these. The latter takes place on steep slopes and requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine the ski run as being similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, your skiing range can be further than walking distance. But in very rare circumstances, you can have the speed of cross-country skiing without having to carry a heavy backpack and ski on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries means having to apply for visas multiple times and going through passport control multiple times.
However, the way Shenzhen operates in this regard is like a country.
As long as you stay within the Schengen area, you usually don't need to go through passport control when crossing borders.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa to each individual Schengen member state, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a unified definition for which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define items over one hundred years old as antiques.
This definition has regional differences; the vintage threshold in places like North America may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than mass-produced products of the same kind.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture of reindeer trade is also important for many other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they relied on fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer mainly used as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people are engaged in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sami region.

A course typically covers all the issues discussed here, with detailed analysis, and usually includes practical experience.
A course typically lasts 2-5 days, including role-playing, extensive first aid training, and some weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are very common, but those mentioning war zones are few and far between.
Travelers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they have the necessary valid documents for their return trip.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or to update documents to reflect desired names and genders.

After September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints also became more intrusive.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to maintain their privacy and dignity when going through scanners.
Rip currents are the backflow of waves that hit the beach, and they usually appear near reefs or similar places.
Due to the underwater topographic backflow being concentrated in some deeper sections, rapid currents towards deep water may originate from here.
Most deaths occur because people try to swim against the current and become exhausted, which is unlikely to succeed.
Once you break free from the current, swimming back is as easy as usual.
If you still haven't been found, try aiming for other locations, but this also depends on your ability and whether you've been noticed, because you might want to wait for rescue.
The impact of returning to the workforce is faster (and the honeymoon period shorter) than culture shock. It lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who once easily adapted to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their own native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you've already adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your own culture.
When you first go abroad, people might be patient and understanding. Because they know that travelers need time to adjust in a new country.
People might not think that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
For the children, the Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can view the pyramids in the dark and watch them in silence before the show begins.

The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, with different pyramids lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are currently subject to territorial claims by several countries, and the islands have a maximum number of bases, with a total of 16 operating bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is where the town of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still-active volcanic crater has been flooded, creating a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula and is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountain range merges into a plateau before giving rise to the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The Sentinel Range in the north boasts the highest mountain in Antarctica, called Vinson Massif, with its peak at Mount Vinson at 4892 meters.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
Satellite phones generally cannot replace mobile phones because you need to be outdoors with no obstructions between you and the satellite to make a call.
This service is often used in maritime applications, including yachts, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, traveling and studying are increasingly popular choices.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before university without affecting their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education in your own country.
Generally speaking, there is a tuition fee to attend these educational courses.
Finland is perfect for boating. This "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
A yacht is not a necessity for touring the archipelago and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, smaller boats, even canoes, can offer a distinct experience.
For Finns, rowing is a very common pastime, with about one boat for every seven or eight people.
Similar situations exist in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but compared to other countries, Finland is very unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one in forty).
Most unique Baltic Sea cruises include extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you will have a full two days to visit this historic city and then return to the ship to sleep at night.
As of 2009, if you are only disembarking from a ship for a tour, you will not need an additional visa.
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the cruise price.
For people of any age and background, flying can be a frightening experience, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced traumatic events.

Courier companies are well compensated for their quick delivery services. Time is often of the essence, especially for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies own their own aircraft, but other routes and smaller companies have problems.
If they transport goods by plane, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on certain routes.
The quickest way is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations prohibit shipping luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a lot of money to enjoy this privilege (a better way is to have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect a business class ticket to be about 4 times the price of a regular economy ticket, and a first-class ticket to be 11 times the price!
Generally speaking, it's pointless to look for deals on business class or first class seats for direct flights from location A to location B.
Because airlines are well aware that some core business travelers are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the emergence of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
Moldova's main religion is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

At the same time, men must wear knee-length pants.
These can also be borrowed from the inventory at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after every use, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!

Pre-modern astronomical observatories have usually been abandoned by now, and are preserved as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution was not as severe during their heyday as it is now, they are often located in cities or on campuses, making them easier to reach than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing is also known as Hanami. It has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China. There, people choose to appreciate plum blossoms.

All the animals that first came to the island arrived here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to its distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to travel long distances, which made giant tortoises the primary grazing animals of the Galápagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galápagos Islands, they brought many mammals, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, meaning the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This provides a great opportunity to see the aurora because the sky will be dark 24 hours a day.
Because these areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is usually not a problem, and you can also enjoy the stars.
