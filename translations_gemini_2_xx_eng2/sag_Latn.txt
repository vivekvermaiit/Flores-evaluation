This strongly suggests that some dinosaurs had diseases or deformities, meaning that animals like those with three fused vertebrae would not have been uncommon.
The expert cut a sample of muscle tissue from the animal that was slightly red on the upper side and the lower side and there were also a lot of blood vessels there.
The investigation of these things reveals much about the development of the body of birds.
Because the skeletal structure of dinosaurs, specifically the spine, isn't very well developed, it's called the rachis, but it doesn't have another skeletal element like birds do—the beak—scholars show that the rachis is a remnant of the skeletal structure amongst the others.
Their body structure allowed them to escape easily, but it also allowed them to resist the attacks of large dinosaurs. Fossil evidence suggests that this was a small dinosaur that could not only resist the attacks of larger dinosaurs, but also easily escape.
These fossils suggest they are the teeth of a young dinosaur, as they show the bite marks of a large dinosaur, but not of a small one.
