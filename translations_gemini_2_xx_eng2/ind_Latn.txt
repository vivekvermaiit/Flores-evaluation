Although one experimental vaccine appears to reduce deaths from Ebola, to date there is no drug that has been clearly proven suitable for treating existing infections.
ZMapp, which was one of the first antibody cocktails in the field, raised hopes, but several formal studies indicated that its benefit in preventing death was less than expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and embraces the absolute necessity of the Olympic family in promoting a safe environment for all our athletes.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a widely held theory, but it can also provide details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say this animal's fur is chestnut-brown on top with paler or carotenoid-tinged underparts.
This discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possessed the other features â€” barbs and barbules â€” the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The feather structure indicates that it was not used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers suggest that, although this is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult bird feathers, not downy feathers.
Researchers argue that, although this is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the sample displays feathers of an adult bird, not downy feathers.
A car bomb that exploded at a police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than 20 others.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principle as other stars: It is known that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by the brightness of their light, their rotation, and that's it.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

Community frustration has led to the current effort to develop policies regarding sexual content for sites that host millions of openly licensed media.
The work done is mostly theoretical, but this program is written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team will be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Like the tides caused by the moon pulling on the Earth, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists can infer that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding galaxies is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo, and is made up of many small particles.
Television reports indicate that white smoke is coming from the power plant.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "very disturbing and concerning due to its very high mortality rate."
Some patients were likely infected with the disease in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll's estimate, and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
Within a year, an infected person can transmit the infection to 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB across the entire group of tuberculosis sufferers still appears low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected within a specific timeframe in South Africa.

This part is cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not stable like large caves on Earth, which often maintain fairly constant temperatures, but is consistent with the presence of deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been an antiquated experience: voters cloister themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate inside, and insert it into an envelope.
After the officers verified the voters' identities, the voters inserted the envelopes into the ballot box and signed the poll.
French electoral law quite strictly regulates the process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and supervisors can witness that there are no envelopes already inside at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are added, except for those that should be counted and belong to official voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although a car crashed into the house with three people inside, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed, and emergency services are extricating the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya at Edinburgh Sheriff Court has been accused of murdering his own child.
He is being held pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be tainted because his photo has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts view publication of the photo as potentially prejudicial.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted that "journalists appear to be treading a dangerous path if they publish photos of suspects, etc.""
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until indictment.
That document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other reported topics included the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence for ten years in the valley once the agreement was signed, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to a military presence for only five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial must be closely supervised by guards because the trial is being monitored and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation have received thorough training and safety briefings.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous CEO's resignation as part of a settlement package to move the country towards new elections.
The investigation is Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, which sometimes turned violent, were triggered by the cancellation of elections that should have been held since 2011.
Sixty cases of iPod malfunctions have been reported, characterized by devices overheating, resulting in six fire incidents and four minor burn injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that they were aware of as many as 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by saying that the delay of Apple's report was "deeply regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas' emergency management office says that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, have been released early, as have the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old woman who wanted to go to the restroom. Mendoza was then shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research shows that when given the hormone, the fetal lungs will mature faster.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorder 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the original Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a double moon night. As unique as they come. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as scary as me... maybe even more so... I loved her and will miss her... may she now be in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
In a poll on this view, 34 percent of them wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaint, his fitness status is now in doubt.
He cannot take the medication he needs for his pain because it is banned from the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets likely delivered water to Earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to those rumors as "political chatter and silliness."
He speculated about running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reducing carbon emissions.
This device utilizes satellite-based technology, instead of the old radar-based technology on the ground, to make it easier for air traffic controllers to pinpoint the exact location of aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transport will not be operating, and diesel trains will not stop at Wembley. Park and ride facilities and car parking will not be available at the ground.
Concerns about a lack of transportation increase the possibility that the match will be forced to be played behind closed doors without supporters.
A study published in a scientific journal on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations. Previously, this process was believed to take much longer. This is due to the breeding of endemic Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortis, and immigrant cactus finches, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various forms, including being rolled into small shapes.
Gold can be drawn into thin wires, allowing it to be twisted and woven. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can also be made extremely thin, so thin that it is sometimes used as decoration for hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical substance is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has been stripped of its electron (because a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then squeeze them into balls with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated waste disposal system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in many houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes integrated with public bathhouses, where men and women used them together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and then bounce it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to outer space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in outer space because Earth's atmosphere alters some of the light and our view.
A giant rocket, taller than 100 feet, is needed to put satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
This leads us to trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
The medium-sized cats beneath them prey on medium-sized animals, such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Lastly, there are many small cats (including escaped domestic cats) that consume far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is a niche concept, a specialized task undertaken by each cat to keep them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male brothers, along with up to 30 females and their young.
Females are usually closely knit, forming large families of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As versatile athletes, tigers can climb (though not very skillfully), swim, leap long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
Tigers are still in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only species that can roar.
A tiger's roar doesn't have the full sound of a lion's roar, but is more like a sentence where the words are spoken with growls and screams.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. Ocelots will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller in size.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and hunt animals to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing out prey trails on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark with their night vision capabilities and also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then ambushing them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from its original, main population (such as if they move to a mountain or river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often encounter an environment that is different from the one they previously inhabited.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to become stronger competitors than they needed before.
Their original population hasn't changed at all; they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they seem to become less and less distinct from other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call it speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they breathe in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (which is to say, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
We make houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator in its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were packed with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, accompanied by extra rows in the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing could escape once it passed through those jaws.
We don't know for sure yet, but it's possible its tongue is forked. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that it has been cannibalistic all this time.
This also affected anything that went into the water, including giant dinosaurs like T. rex, which were unable to compete with it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans did indulge in the odd or unusual banquet fare, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women eat while sitting in chairs, rich people like to enjoy banquets together while relaxing and eating their food.
Ancient Roman food could not include foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
The people will bring offerings to the gods, and the priests will strive to fulfill the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and a sanctuary inside that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not so important.
Much of Jewish family life takes place in the open.
The woman is cooking in the yard, the shops used to be just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There are no large forests in the Land of Canaan, which is why wood is very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo people were already living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think treasure maps are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Despite the writing on the back, this document is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, inverted.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days the large parchment document (measuring 29Â¾ inches by 24Â½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, that notation was most likely inserted just as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
That territory was governed by "Vichy" France. They were French people who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940. This invasion was codenamed "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving into Germany.
Civilization is a single culture that is practiced together by a group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also becomes a benchmark for the size of a society.
City-states were pioneers of the nation. Cultural civilization signifies the continuation of knowledge across generations, remaining cultural traces, and natural dissemination.
Minority cultures typically disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as viable civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states first formed a weak central government â€” with Congress as its sole component â€” under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes. Because there was no national executive or judiciary, the Congress relied on the authority of the states, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its measures.
He also does not have the authority to override tax regulations and tariffs between states.
These articles require unanimous agreement from all states before they can be amended, but the states disregard the central government, so their representatives are often absent.
Italian national football, along with the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include: football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
The story of Taiwan begins as far back as the 15th century when passing European sailors noted the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, initiating transformations in local grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in its rice paddies and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can have a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still in production to this day, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format, somewhat confusingly, actually has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format groups) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, most often violated and underestimated, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is said that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During a historical period in Europe, the Catholic Church (which had become rich and powerful) was closely monitored.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united the nations of Europe despite their different languages and customs.
His all-encompassing power influenced everything, from the king to the common people.
One of the principles of Christian teaching is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty. Church monetary funds are available for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money makes many question whether its teachings have been fulfilled.
As soon as hostilities broke out, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering all parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, many nations were determined to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.

Ancient China had a unique way of marking different time periods; each stage in China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there were periods of instability marked by fragmented provinces. The most popular story from this era is the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which takes place during the 60-year period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce warfare occurred among the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people dying to fight for a seat on the highest throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolute rule to republics, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, job vacancies were opened to all male applicants, creating opportunities for success for the most ambitious among them.
The same goes for the military, because instead of army ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave, later known as "Hira'", on Mount "Nur" (light) to meditate.
He secluded himself, an act that has endured across time, providing a vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave was truly isolated from the rest of the world.
The truth is, this place isn't easy to find even when someone knows it exists. Once inside the cave, the condition is one of total isolation.
There's nothing to see but the beautiful, clear sky above and the mountains all around. Very little can be seen or heard from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arc up" mark looks like a V, and the "arc down" mark looks like staples or a square without its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upward strokes usually produce a softer sound, while downward strokes are stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own markings, but there's a musical reason for the printed bowing, so usually those markings should be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
By wagon, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and calling out threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to throw open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a member of the mob brandished the head of a slain royal guard from Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The US imperialist war expenditure in conquering the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance most of the expenses and bond interest floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The immense profits reaped from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are certainly a fundamental benefit for US imperialism.
To understand the Temple, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of that commandment.
The period in which these events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages of the European historical period in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages spanned from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, conventionally ending around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term whose practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological impetus or necessity to the strict notion that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology ultimately has inherent "effects" on society, rather than simply being socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that cars should drive the development of highways.
Even so, a national highway network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to high accident rates on the roads, which in turn spurred the discovery of new techniques in the medical world to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism possesses a considerable element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time customs and cultures arise that are associated with that geography, and this, in harmony with the people's place, is better than laws arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began from the year 400 to around 1100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, particularly as the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at that moment that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
As the Late Middle Ages approached, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the biggest developments at that time was a result of the Crusades: people began using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, and uses saved seeds originating from the local ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture and differentiate it from others can include language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture typically mark their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, including fashion, demeanor, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by drawing upon several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Children like that are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child neglect is caused by parental rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some say they lived in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like the specific animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or tangible; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software and aims to question, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too challenging for students to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
Children should not have to grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care for, and educate, but the reality is that they do.
We consider the Foster Home System as a safe zone for these children.
Our parenting system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide everything that was lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratification approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recorders led to the important discovery of micro-expression interpretation, facial movements that occur in milliseconds.
Specifically, it is stated that we can detect whether someone is lying by observing their microexpressions correctly.
In his paper titled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrated how someone who doesn't understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that such an ability to interpret human behavior might be possessed by animals like pet dogs.
20th-century research indicated that there were two genetic variations: recessive and dominant.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between two pools with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant sources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences, namely stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based sources to obtain are the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking all things into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors overcame the "protein problem" in a way that was almost similar to chimpanzees in the savanna today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of you waking up intentionally during a normal sleep period, then falling back asleep a short time later (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to make you aware without fully waking you up.
If you keep restarting the alarm while sleepy, then the alarm clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, forcing a person to wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism uses the foundation of the Buddha's teachings, but then expands it with the support of Mahayana compassion and with many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Fundamentally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of loving-kindness for all.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The Tibetan people's meditation center is the God Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which resulted in cooperation between the Soviet Union and the US. With the end of the war and the conflict of systems, processes, and cultures, it led to the downfall of nations.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
The war lasted for the next 40 years and would be fought in reality, by proxy forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses were shattered, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, this plan became obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods over such distances is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The navy's task is traditionally to ensure that your country can maintain its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, hindering your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most important and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in WWII. America tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help England.
At the same time, the German navy, mostly using U-boats, once tried to prevent this congestion.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer England just as it did other European countries.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising goats to easily obtain their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats typically oversee herds that roam the hills or other grazing areas. Goats tend to be frequently used by children or adults, similar to those more commonly known by shepherds. This herding method is still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the train tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, with these tracks horses could pull carts faster and carry more loads than on the slightly rougher roads at the same time.
Rail pads were introduced early on to hold the track in place. However, it was slowly realized that the track would be more efficient if it had a layer of iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron causes the wooden wheels on the cart to wear out faster.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were created.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking. With the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) two million years ago, humans began to walk upright.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have already been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce the impact caused in the future.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problem, and we must neutralize it.
It's quite clear that the world is developing due to science and technology, and that overpopulation and wasteful human lifestyles are becoming quite significant problems.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was taken a few blocks to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, about 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The only known surviving broadside of the 25 Dunlap prints is the oldest extant copy of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite common, making diagnosis difficult to make immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the first aid instructions label specific to the particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from a past familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are extremely adaptable as parasites on humans.
Both Assassin Bugs and Bed Bugs are nidicolous animals, adapted to living in the nests or homes of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 registered cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple might decide that for their own good, or for the good of their child, to co-parent.
This couple can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method essentially guides the majority of scientific research.
This isn't alone; experimentation, and an experiment which is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, had been accepted.
As interest in Greek knowledge dwindled, the West found itself cut off from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many have observed that rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants.
A biological clock is a self-sustained oscillator that will continue its free-running cyclical period even when external cues are absent.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was a key piece of evidence demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They had performed two experiments, namely labeling the DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus and labeling the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to natural areas to enjoy natural scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Sample activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as learning information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Kalimantan.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their workplaces and pass by others whose workplaces are the place they just left.
In dynamic ridesharing, which is a form of dynamic transport, each person is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Current scientific understanding indicates that this massive carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states which, for the past two million years, has supported human evolution.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are such complaints arising regarding the transportation system, why do their services always fail? Are the transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening right now?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have reasonable consistency and can be more or less mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship assists in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to explore the skies. Their ability to fly helps them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings parallel to their body.
This gives them a wider range of small-sized places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: the Solar System, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width of approximately 9.6 kilometers.
About 20 percent of all the water flowing from rivers into the world's oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramid construction were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a daily language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these could all be found in nature in their native form and were relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four properties of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so much so that the period at the end of this sentence could contain trillions of atoms.
Upon its emergence, the pencil became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, along with the emergence of newer writing methods, the status and use of pencils have declined.
People these days write messages on computer screens, never having to use a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is required to form an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means the atoms are prone to breaking apart with little or no provocation.
The Moon's surface is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
Its crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner below the maria and thicker below the highlands.
There are likely more dark areas on the near side because its crust is thinner. Lava can more easily rise to the surface.
Satisfaction theory centers on discovering what motivates people or what captures their interest.
These various theories suggest that humans have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow into adulthood.
This theory analyzes the characteristics of people that make them desire something, and the factors in their environment that cause them to do or not do a specific thing.
Two well-known motivation theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
A manager like this struggles to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone turns into an unrecognizable individual, who feels they must change everything the team has done and do it all alone.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to division between leaders and team members.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for their corresponding in-person groups.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to various time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of a real "phantom team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
A "phantom team" is a management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of practicing the learning organization concept is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively across the organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome problems can give rise to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, these data narrow the area of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors impact behavioral changes and certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes in ways never before possible.
This gives us a lot of information as well as material for developing simulation models that help us understand the processes within our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Things like this have become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into some home computer applications and video game software.
Excursions are an important part of school. Often, a teacher is happy to take their students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing virtual field trips is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; each year the website's design is changed, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Meanwhile, students usually start out with poor grammar and spelling when creating a blog, but the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because students are typically the most critical audience, blog writers are starting to improve their writing quality to avoid criticism.
"In addition, blogs also "force students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy an audience inspires students to be resourceful and engaging (Toto, 2004)."
Blogs are tools that inspire collaboration and encourage learners to extend their learning beyond the typical school environment.
"The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical: by actively responding to internet material, students can define their position in the context of other writings and also outline their opinions on a number of issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada, bilingual, and features various art galleries and museums showcasing Canada past and present.
Far to the south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and its surroundings.
All of this and many other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider to be quintessentially Canadian.
Vast areas to the north are sparsely populated, and some are even nearly uninhabitable wilderness.
Here's a comparison of populations that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are people living in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most distinctive continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, which then grew significantly in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, this region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Female: Female tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
If you also wear a ring, it would be very helpful (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon for this to be followed by gripping of their arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it can be tolerated!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city into Daru I-Badya. The city was then named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various trinkets, but all of this is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the extreme eastern region near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma should be researched in order to understand the ongoing state of conflict in North Kivu Province.
This city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest treks to find Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~ 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Due to its relatively inaccessible location, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for an exotic and faraway land.
Currently, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
This site is one of the main stops on the PBS special, Africa's Great Civilizations by Henry Louis Gates.
This city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, because it is more Arab in style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
This park covers 19,500 kmÂ² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, this park levies a daily entry and conservation fee.
It might also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to select parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the Hong Kong territory and a place many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The row of buildings that make the Hong Kong skyline resemble a glittering bar graph is further clarified by its reflection in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is crowded onto reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that was seized by British colonizers as their own, and if you are looking for evidence of colonial territories in the past, this is the right place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just mangrove swamp—it also includes some trees still standing from the vast forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Intercity buses are usually full, so it's best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers soar to a height of 83 meters, have a length of 378 meters, and feature two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge was planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint was scheduled to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most significant Indigenous group inhabiting what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish nation began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has successfully preserved much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times throughout the year.
For news about the tournament and where to buy polo match tickets, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP) at par.
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the archipelago, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is widely accepted everywhere on the island, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also usually accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and United States currency may be. Ask the owner beforehand to confirm which payment methods they accept.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside the islands is near impossible, so exchange it before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, its summer coincides with the winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winter can be extremely cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There is no "rainy" or "dry" season: because the amount of rainfall is almost always the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in this park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from other wild animals.
No matter how tame they may seem, bison, deer, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it's best to keep your distance.
Additionally, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
That harbor was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Great Britain refused to leave port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle led by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city ended in the assassination of a key leader: Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's position encompassing two harbors. The most popular ones are in three regions.
North Shore beaches (located within the North Harbour district) are situated on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of its beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most have shade provided by rows of pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, on the edge of the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes family-friendly, lined with nice shops along the shore. It is safe to swim here.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to be had, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for travel.
Local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is something foreign. Black coffee is simply 'espresso', cappuccino comes with a high cream content (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
Many tours to the reefs take place throughout the year, and accidents on the reefs due to these are very rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April above the year 1770. These jellyfish can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not actively living in the open ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind, knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through them as well.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your purpose (e.g., visa).
All changes or requests must be arranged through the travel agent first, and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and a majority of visitors consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the show, then you should arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there are parts of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have camping areas specifically for families with young children.
If traversing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, because when passing through ice the noise is extraordinary, especially for those most affected.
The Saint Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the requirements).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to optimize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them on-site.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs clarity of thought, and all skilled gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or crossing mountainous regions needs to factor in the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On slippery and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like you would on normal asphalt.
During a snowstorm, you can be trapped by rapidly collapsing snow.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is arguably the biggest draw for tourism in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term "safari" refers to an overland journey to view Africa's stunning wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the car, so the standard equipment already allows for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes don't want to show themselves and are better viewed with binoculars.
Walking safaris (also known as "bush walks," "safari hikes," or going "on foot") involve hiking, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some sporting events will be held at a number of other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, after its first time in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the delays were announced, you may be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but by the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry quickly. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if they are not available in the rooms.
If an iron is not available, or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is considered sufficient, while in others, several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with in their hometowns.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, lead to allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit diseases.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with their strength, are usually not included in the pest category.
Shopping at duty-free stores is an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers visiting high-tax countries can sometimes save money on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently traversing remote, rural areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be warned: there are many steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp turns.
The speed limit is lower than the preceding and following sections—generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and it's important to adhere to it strictly rather than the alternative.
Oddly enough, cell phone service is stronger here than in other places along this route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cookies are quite delicious, and in Bavaria, the cookies are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit crumbles are quite common, with apples being cooked into crumbles year-round, and then there are cherries and plums which appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small but flavorful cake, try either a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region you are in.
Curry is a dish consisting of spices and seasonings, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes. In South India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
There are 17,000 islands to choose from, and Indonesian food is a general term that represents the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, used without further qualification, the term tends to denote food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, offering a variety of simply seasoned dishes. The main seasonings favored in Javanese cuisine are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
A stirrup is a support for the rider's foot that hangs on either side of the saddle.
It provides greater stability for the rider, but potentially poses a safety issue due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in it.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs. To minimize the risk, a number of safety precautions are taken.
First, most drivers wear driving boots with smooth and narrow heels and soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Nicknamed the Yosemite of South America, Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley, boasts a variety of cliffs and giant granite rock faces.
Its highest point offers a breathtaking view from the summit. Climbers from all over the world continue to create new routes among its limitless wall potential.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes nicknamed "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old â€” cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing has existed since around the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
This is related, but usually has nothing to do with ski touring or alpine-style climbing, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires much sturdier boots and skis.
Think of the ski route as a familiar hiking route.
When conditions are good, you can travel further than on foot – but rarely can you go as fast as cross-country skiing without carrying a heavy backpack on a groomed track.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to a number of these countries requires us to apply for visas and go through passport control more than once.
The Schengen Area, however, functions like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa to each individual Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There is no universal definition determining which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax offices define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, with the age limit being lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding its trade is also important for many people and professions.
Although traditionally not all Sámi people herded reindeer on a large scale, some lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and primarily used reindeer as working animals.
Currently, many Sami people work in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative prejudices and inaccurate perceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to seek advice from other governments besides your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than European or Arab citizens.
Advice is a short summary of the political situation in a country.
The views given are usually cursory, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for dangerous weather phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and its types vary depending on geographic, topographic, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, cold waves, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be cautious about the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as this can impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should obtain professional training.
An internet search for "Unfriendly Environment Course" might give you the address of a local company.
The general course will cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually accompanied by practical experience.
The course lasts 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines discussing survival in the wilderness are common, but publications that discuss the battlefield are few in number.
People planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documentation for their return travel.
The government's willingness to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to reflect a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies greatly.
Security checks at checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people before surgery cannot pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are strong, localized currents flowing away from the shore, often occurring near reefs or similar structures.
Due to its underwater topography, back currents are concentrated in certain deeper sections, and rapid currents into deep water can form there.
Most deaths were caused by exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which was a futile effort.
Once out of the current, swimming back isn't as difficult as usual.
Try to go to another place where you won't get caught again, or, based on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for help to arrive.
Reverse culture shock comes back faster than culture shock (less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have an easy time adapting to new cultures sometimes have a difficult time readjusting to their original culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
When you go abroad for the first time, people may be patient and understanding, knowing that tourists in a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize that understanding and patience are also necessary for returning travelers.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most attractive attractions for children in this area.
You can see the pyramid in the dark, and you can see it discreetly before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and traders. The story that revolves around sound and light is like a fairytale.
The Sphinx serves as both the backdrop and narrator for a long story.
The scene was performed at the pyramid, and other pyramids were illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
These islands are located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which has the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others like Livingston Island and Deception Island, which is a flooded caldera, are still active volcanoes that form spectacular natural harbors.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on this Peninsula merge into a plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or Sentinel Range stands Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, which culminates in the 4892 m Mount Vinson.
When in a remote location with no cellular service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are usually not a replacement for cell phones because you must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a call.
This service is often used by shipping companies, including cruise ships, as well as expeditions that require long-range voice and data communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
A growingly popular option for those planning to defer college is: traveling and learning.
This is very popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without sacrificing their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year course abroad can increase your chances of moving to a higher level of education in your home country.
Generally, there is a fee to register for this educational program.
Finland is a great destination for boating. This "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both on its lakes and in its coastal archipelagoes.
On the islands and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are big enough for cruise ships, small boats or even kayaks will offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland; seven out of eight people own a boat.
This aligns with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises feature extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a few full days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If traveling only by ship, you do not require a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fear and dislike of what others possess.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear stemming from the unknown or a lack of control.
Shipping companies are paid well enough to deliver goods quickly. Often, time is of the essence for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but problems occur on other routes and with smaller companies.
If they ship goods by air freight, on some routes it may take days to get through loading, unloading, and customs.
The only way to get it through faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The surest way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money to redeem the benefits (or, better yet, have your company pay for it for you).
However, the price isn't cheap: as a rough estimate, you might pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class.
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of flyers willing to pay more to reach their desired destination quickly, comfortably, and at a price that suits them.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been rebuilt between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Formerly the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, thriving, and bustling commercial center, situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are juxtaposed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city feels more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby Eysturoy Island and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, an attractive marble carving of a dove sits atop several tombs.
Wandering around that charming village took half an hour.
Located to the north and easily accessible is the romantic and enchanting town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron recorded its glittering splendor.
Scotturb bus 403 regularly departs for Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
And also in the northern part, visit the Protection of Our Lady Fatima (Shrine), a world-renowned Marian apparition site.
Please remember that you are visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site of immeasurable significance to a significant population of the world.
There are still many men and women surviving here, and even more who have loved ones who were killed or worked to death there, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Please treat this place with dignity, reverence, and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by scribbling or scratching graffiti on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Nearly half of the population prefers to speak in Catalan, the majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only written in Catalan because that language is established by law as the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced via an automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although often this is just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-raised). It makes getting around much easier.
The rudeness of Parisians will quickly evaporate if you display basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has dense forests, mainly filled with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a blend of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a highly diverse plant community, due to a range of microclimates, differing soils, and varied elevations.
This area is also home to a diverse range of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and capercaillie can be found there, as well as a wide variety of other common species.
When visiting the monastery, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most temples provide cloths for women who don't bring them, but if you bring your own cloth, especially one that is brightly colored, you'll receive a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after other users wear them, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing this skirt. One size fits all men.
Majorcan cuisine, like that found in similar zones of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and exclusively uses olive oil.
A popular simple dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, and others.
All nouns, besides the word "Sie" for "You", are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between certain verbs and objects.
This can be said to make reading easier, although writing is quite difficult because you need to figure out whether the object form being used is a verb or an adjective.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Additionally, make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means carriage.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar guide will help you learn more about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
It's clear that if you're fluent in a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, someone who knows a little Spanish might rashly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete in modern times and are used as museums or educational centers.
Light pollution in their time was not the same as the problem today. They were usually located in cities or on campuses and were easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are giant facilities in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where the plum blossom is the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festival was held by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take a specimen, even if it's "just one."
When visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you kicked out, no questions asked.
Singapore is generally a very safe and easy place to get around. You can buy almost anything after you arrive.
However, because it's located in a "tropical highland" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with the heat (always) as well as strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also some buses that head north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the patriarchs from the biblical story of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take passes through Hebron and not just the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.
Rivers in the interior can be a great theme for a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or sailing to interesting places on the Danube, or boating along the Erie Canal.
They are also decisive for popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the biggest holidays in Christianity. Christmas is celebrated as the day Jesus was born.
Many traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-Christians in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake outdoors to wait for the sunrise.
Of course, there is a Christian theological explanation for this tradition, but it may also be a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend. Congregations of this kind often spontaneously celebrate the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that initially arrived in these islands came by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to their distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making giant tortoises the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be darker around that time.
As the population in this area dwindles, light pollution is no longer a problem. You can enjoy the starlight.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Western culture.
A suit is standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Workplace harmony is very important, emphasizing group efforts over individual achievements.
Workers must frequently obtain their superiors' approval for every decision they make and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
