This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already popular, but also reveals details that fossils usually cannot show, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other feather functions – barbs and barbules – researchers hypothesized that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, like the other relevant functions.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not downy fluff.
The researchers indicated that, although this was the tail of a dinosaur, the sample showed the plumage of an adult and not a chick's down.

The work undertaken was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon affects gravity on Earth, thus causing tides, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy with its forces.
The researchers concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in exactly the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory posits that the vast majority of dark matter surrounding a galaxy resides around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll overcame the tuberculosis (XDR-TB) that was extremely resistant to medicine in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some of the patients may have been infected with the bacteria in the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers.
Within about a year, an infected person can quickly infect 10 to 15 of their close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire population with tuberculosis appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters go alone into a booth, place a pre-printed ballot paper indicating their candidate's choice in an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
French electoral law has quite strict codification of the legal proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except for those carefully counted and from approved eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all parts of the process. During the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers according to specific procedures and under strict supervision.

In her second run, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Loesch in first place and 1:09.02 minutes behind Hungary's Gøngyi Dani in ninth place.
In the women's sitting group, four skiers failed to complete the race, and 45 of the total 117 athletes in giant slalom failed to advance.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Acting Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with their faces covered, said Chief Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
Emergency services helped the driver out of the red Audi TT, while the street where the accident occurred was temporarily closed.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh court accused of killing his son.
She is remanded in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitnesses may have been influenced since her picture has been widely publicized.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, so courts consider the publication of images as potentially harmful to the victim.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes "journalists appear to be walking a tightrope if they publish pictures etc. of suspects."
Journalists have been informed by the Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, that no further comments will be made before indictment.
According to the leak, the document is to refer to the border disputes, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
The future situation of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley were among the topics raised.
Israel is still demanding a military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian state is agreeing to let this force remain for only five years.
Shooters in the supplemental pest control were closely monitored by forest rangers, which meant that the trial was monitored and its efficiency evaluated.
In cooperation with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new 9-member electoral council (CEP).
It is in fact Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission last month recommended the dismissal of the former CEP (Haiti's electoral commission) as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was a response from Martelly to widespread demonstrations against the regime, which began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations arose due to a lack of held elections, some overdue since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said they were aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (19:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office said that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino man, formerly a police officer, held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Eventually, photographers took the seat of an old woman when she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 he began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would increase the speed of the baby's lung development.
Xinhua reported that state investigators retrieved two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was just as weird as me...maybe even more so...love her and will miss her...hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard asserted during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent in the opinion poll share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the opinion poll, 29% think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim both the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to the complaints, doubts have arisen about his form.
He hasn't been able to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, because they are banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several individuals verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the cause of water on Earth, in addition to organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth long ago, researchers hope to understand how planets form, especially with regard to Earth.
Cuomo (53) began serving as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and stupidity."
There is speculation about whether he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will make it possible to fly shorter routes and annually save a lot of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based technology, which allows air traffic control to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport will be provided, overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and short-stay facilities are unavailable at the ground.
The possibility of being forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters was raised due to fears of a lack of transport.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species had evolved in just two generations, although many had thought that this process would take much longer due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the Medium Ground Finch, and the cactus finch immigrant, the Large Cactus Finch.
Gold can come in all sorts of forms. It can be rolled into minuscule shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can also be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and adhere firmly to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH. You can create an indicator using cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color completely depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms are one proton and one electron).
Mix together the two dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this feels strange and creates a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had water closets connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient times, toilets also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together.
The times you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent to space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
A gigantic rocket over 100 British feet tall is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in wonderful ways. The best thing the wheel has given us is a means of transport that is much easier and faster.
It has given us many transportation units such as the train, the car, and more.
Below them, there are several mid-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey animals ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are several small domestic cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that prey on the far more numerous prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to success is the niche concept. A specific job each cat has, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and they live together in larger groups called prides.
The alliances consist of 1-3 related adult males, along with up to thirty females and pups.
The females are usually closely related to each other, as they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that have surprisingly much in common with the behavior of lions (but not with other big cats). They are also deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These 4 felines are the only ones that roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the full-grown roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of yelping words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, sniffing the ground to find where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move completely unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came, for example, if they move across a mountainous area or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back, they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new population will need different functions or adaptations than they did before to be a strong competitor, as this new environment has different resources and different competitors.
The indigenous population hasn't changed; they still need the same accommodations as before.
As the new people gradually begin to adapt to their new surroundings, they look less and less like the other population.
After a couple of thousand years or after millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We have named this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (so just breathe out well).
Plants create their food from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals would not survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, afraid of nothing, with the exception of other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws held over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper jaw; none who crossed its path came away alive.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may also have been a cannibal.
In addition, it would attack anything that came into the water, even a gigantic dinosaur like T. rex would be no match for it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
The fact that poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, while rich men liked to have banquets together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals, was another difference.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn or tomatoes, nor potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans had tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, and these were seen as the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary built for the god.
Housing was not as essential in the high-temperate climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family mostly lived outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the garden; shops were just open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the lands around Canaan, which made timber extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and then they found Greenland while traveling west and named it Greenland.
But Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time, independent of his discovery.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though all the countries were "Scandinavian."
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you can probably imagine that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite something being written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So the note was probably added as a label.
The invasion and the subsequent fighting on D-Day liberated Northern France, but Southern France was still not liberated.
It was controlled by French "Vichy" individuals. These were French people who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and actually worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
The invasion on August 15, 1940, when the Allies invaded southern France, was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a fairly large population who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this thus defines, in a way, the size of the society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilizational culture requires passing on knowledge through multiple generations, a linguistic footprint, and just dissemination that lasts.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not regarded as proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress as its sole component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it was dependent on state authorities, who were usually unwilling to cooperate to enforce its actions.
It also had no authority to override tax law and tariffs between the states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian and German national teams are the second best teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing are well-liked sports.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is called Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical context, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history begins in the 15th century when passing European sailors give the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reorganization of indigenous grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice paddies and sugar plantations.
Forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's coastal areas in the west and north in 1683, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
Following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the rights to Taiwan to Japan, who continued to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has 3 important structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally constructed.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, 35 mm is still the most common format for still photography in the world, as it was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, the digital camera's image sensor formats have inherited the camera's aspect ratio.
It can be a little confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio in relation to this format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS family formats) are similar to, or approximately equal to, this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds is much abused and often ridiculed, but it's a simple guideline that creates dynamism while still providing a sense of order in a picture.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized during this period in European history.
For thousands of years, Christianity had bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing authority touched everyone, from king to commoners.
One of the essential principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce pain and poverty, and that is why the church has its funds.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy demonstrated the effectiveness of cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated widely accepted international law codified through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain bombed international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, creating a danger even for neutral ships.
Germany was prepared for a corresponding response to its unrestricted submarine warfare, as there had been a limited response to this tactic.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed all the fear and horrors of war during the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the foreman from his previous position) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each phase of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms, which took place over 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many kings who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying as they fought to sit on the throne in the great palace at Xiadel.
There are several social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation is governed by its citizens instead of just one ruler.
Even after the revolution, it was open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applied to the defense, because instead of military ranks based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution motivated other oppressed working-class people in other nations to also start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond mortal life. He often used a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light), where he went to contemplate.
The cave itself, preserved through the years, offers a very vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
On a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave lies completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It's actually not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
There is nothing else to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The only one of the seven wonders that still stands today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, includes many pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upstroke" symbol resembles a V, and the "downstroke" symbol resembles a staple or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and push the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more definite.
You're welcome to use a pencil and create your own markings, but don't forget that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be taken into account.
The terrified royal family, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, along with their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
The king and queen traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that screamed and shouted threats at them.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows completely open.
A member of the gang at one point swung his head to a royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves had to pay for the cost of the war of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the costs, and the interest on bonds was transacted in the name of the Philippine authorities through banking houses on Wall Street.
The super-profits extracted from the exploitation of the Filipino people were a fundamental gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the circumstances that led to the order's creation.
The period in which these events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages in the period of European history that is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The Mughal Empire mostly did not interfere in social culture and traditions throughout its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, which led to more systematic, centralized, and uniform rules.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general beliefs: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology additionally has "effects" on society that are inherent, rather than socially contingent.
One could say, for example, that road development is a result of the car.
A nationwide road network, however, is not economically viable if it is only used by a handful of cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass car ownership creates more frequent accidents on roads, which has led to the invention of new methods in the healthcare sector to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism had a greater element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
What characterized Romanticism was the idea that the landscape shaped individuals, and that over time geographical habits and cultures arose, and that these, when they harmonized with one's position in society, were better than randomly imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of fashion in our time, Constantinople was seen as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It has been known to be an epicenter of luxury from approximately 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status was not the same in the 12th century, mainly due to the crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valued than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
In the beginning, attire was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
But due to slow communication channels, styles in the west could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style. One of the biggest changes that occurred at that time, and as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to close garments.
Subsistence farming is agriculture for the production of enough food to just meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds belonging to the area combined with crop rotation or other techniques to maximize yields that are relatively simple.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is still relevant in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded from mainstream social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be special due to their members' age, ethnicity, class, region, and/or gender.
The qualities that specify a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take as a starting point the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, were not sufficiently socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral children." Some feral children have been held in captivity by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
It is possible that children who are feral may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or managed to escape.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a feral child is completely raised by animals, it develops behavior (within physical limitations) that is almost identical to the fostering animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it to a new level.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that supports individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical. In other words, a teacher can be a form of scaffolding, but so can the little paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support functions are embedded in the software and are intended to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an atmosphere that is not caring and educational, but it happens.
We understand that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system shall ensure safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should be able to provide all the necessities that they did not have in the home they came from.
It's a combination of elements with both mass and interpersonal communication on the internet.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet add extra dimensions to the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motivating factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified "personal involvement" and "enduring relationships" as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience reactions to websites (1998).
Through the use of video recordings, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, movements in the face that last only a few milliseconds.
It has been particularly claimed that one can determine if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his article, The President's Tale, Oliver Sacks suggests how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He also claims that such abilities to explain human behavior can be shared by animals such as pet dogs.
According to modern research, there are two types of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination alternate back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to obtain sufficient amino acids from the available plant resources on the savanna.
Moreover, there are major consequences to not doing it: growth stunting, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins in leaves and legumes would have been the most accessible plant resources, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking them first.
Animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs), in contrast, are not only easily digestible, but they also provide high quantities of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
We shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" with quite the same method that chimpanzees on the savanna use today.
Sleep disruption is the process of conscious awakening during the normal sleep period while falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a fairly quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find that you turn off the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which leads to having to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only things standing in the way of gaining such insight are our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded to include Mahayana's path of loving-kindness and various methods from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and unconditional love.
Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) can be awakened with kundalini yoga through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Tibetan meditation revolves around deity yoga. The energy channels are cleansed by visualizing various deities. In this way, the chakras will be activated and consciousness will be enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. The clashes between system, process, and culture led to the countries falling out towards the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would truly be fought, by proxy armies on battlefields in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places in Africa and Asia.
By 17.09.1939, the Polish defense was already broken down, and the last possibility was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian border.
These plans nevertheless became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Peace Treaty, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II is one of the most important recent examples of this. The Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic to provide aid to Great Britain.
The German navy simultaneously attempted to stop this traffic, mostly using submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Great Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
It started with ancient cultures and tribes keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other places for grazing, usually cared for by goat herders who were often children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Cartways in England were made as early as the 16th century.
Even though the wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull themselves to achieve greater speeds and haul more cargo than on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
To keep the rails in place, the flanged rail was introduced quite early. Little by little, however, it was realized that the rails were more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron created more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Gradually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transportation. Humans began walking upright 2 million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, and bipedal specialization has been discovered in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2–3.9 million years.
We can start by adopting a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is often just like treating the symptoms. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and remove them.
The world has changed greatly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and the difficulties have become more complicated due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
A handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, and then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop after its adoption by Congress on July 4th.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and these are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One arrived to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The first handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives to this day – they are called birds.
Some people don't consider them to be real dinosaurs because they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all PCs in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally not sufficient for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be finding open medicine containers or toxic household products at the scene.
For first aid instructions specific to the poison, see the label.
Entomologists use the word insect in a formal sense for this group of creatures.
This term originates from an old association with mites, insects that are highly adapted to attack humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in nests or the house of their host.
From what we know, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may come to the conclusion that it is not the best for them, or the child, that they raise a child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. Most scientific research is, in fact, guided by this method.
Experimentation is not alone there, however, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the potential hypotheses by asking questions. Observations also contribute to guiding scientific research in the right direction.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and particularly on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's view on everything related to science, including psychology, was accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became more distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that can be observed in physiology and behavior are usually completely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been detected in virtually all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and not only as reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of autonomous cycles without external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the foremost proposals that claimed DNA could be a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or in other words viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material that is affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and examining details about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive by car to get to work outside the village, while others drive in the opposite direction because their workplace is in the village that the others are driving out of.
In this dynamic mode of transport, everyone is somehow connected to, and a supporter of, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows that the large carbon economy has detached the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Most people are dissatisfied with transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate such discontent, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of individual drivers and vehicle movements between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is complicated, as it's impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with one hundred percent certainty.
Drivers thankfully tend to behave with reasonable consistency, allowing traffic flow to remain fairly consistent and be calculated mathematically with a reasonable degree of certainty.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three key properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in connection with the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. Their ability to fly made it easier and more efficient for them to escape enemies, find food, and mates.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
Because of this, they have several small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus believed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the Earth's largest and second-longest river. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching ten kilometers wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon River, is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although pyramids continued to be built of stone until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, they never surpassed the size and technical execution of the pyramids at Giza.
Egyptians from the New Kingdom in antiquity marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language used by the Vatican City in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language used daily by state employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every citizen of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these are found in their natural form in nature and because they are relatively easy to extract, even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had theories that everything involves a mixture of one or more of Earth's four elements. The four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the 4 states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also believed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mix of 2 or more metals. Remember that there is a multitude of elements on the periodic table.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that several trillion of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good helper for many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, now that newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less use.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, and must never get close to a sniper.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with more protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splits the core again and releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to fall apart more or less spontaneously.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the long side.
Thinner under Maria, and thicker under the highlands.
It's possible there's more magma on the side facing us, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and approach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain individuals that makes them want the things they want, and what aspects of their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Typically, two behavioral patterns emerge when leaders begin to manage their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum involves trying to remain "one of the gang."
For this type of leader, it can be difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, performance reviews, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable person who feels he or she must change absolutely everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for whether the team wins or loses.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may need to meet according to many different time zones, something that local management may not always understand.
An "invisible team" that is present (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element in a virtual team.
The "invisible group" is the management team that each of the members reports to. The invisible group sets the standard for each individual member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively by all functional departments in an organization, creativity and innovation can arise.
The process where an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can thus lead to new innovative processes that can help meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a way to provide assistance to organizations to improve performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. It narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The interplay between brain pathology and behavior is a validation for researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Brain structures and processes we have never seen before are now possible to investigate thanks to the emergence of new technologies.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that take place in our brain.
Although artificial intelligence AI evokes a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is about creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling and planning the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting analysis, voice, and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, and is built into many home PCs and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of every classroom. Teachers usually love to take students to places where a bus ride isn't possible.
Technology provides the opportunity for a solution with virtual field trips. Students can observe museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing the field trip virtually can also be a great method for reflecting on a journey and sharing experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet school in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the capital, the website is restructured each year, but old versions are kept online to be used as a scrapbook.
Bloggers can also contribute to improving student writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience will generally change that.
The blogger started improving their writing to avoid criticism, as students are often the most critical audience.
Also, blogging "forces students to be more updated on the world around them." The need to provide what is desired to the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that motivates collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning abilities beyond the typical school day they are used to.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students to think more analytically and critically; by reacting actively to internet materials, students can define their positions in relation to others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, boasting numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's history and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, in Muskoka and beyond, one finds untouched nature in all its beauty.
All this and more shows Ontario as it is perceived by outsiders to be authentically Canadian.
Large areas to the north are very sparsely populated, and in some places consist almost entirely of uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans residing in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of them and is a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the nations, and it became popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, it is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It is recommended that female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they might see as harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it still doesn't make it acceptable!).
The city we know today as Casablanca was founded in the tenth century BCE and was used as a strategic port under the name Anfa by Berber fishermen, Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese tore it down and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it became known as Casablanca due to Spanish merchants who had established their trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hoodies, and a whole spectrum of djellabas, are easy to find around the old medina, but they are mainly sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is located in the east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, an eruption that led to most of the city's streets, especially the city center, being buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside Goma should be researched in advance to understand the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the most affordable gorilla trekking in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). The typical (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands, combined with relative inaccessibility.
Even though Timbuktu has its own airport and its reputation has made the city a tourist attraction, it is a very poor city.
Due to the threat from desert sand, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to cities in the rest of the country, because it has more of an Arabic than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forming its southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km² and can be divided into 14 different ecozones, which support diverse wildlife.
This is one of the most popular attractions in South Africa and is considered the finest national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card (a ticket), which grants access to either a selection of parks, or all the national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The parade of buildings that makes up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph, clearly displayed thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
If you want the finest view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and travel to Kowloon's waterfront, which is located opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and this is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The largest mangrove forest on the planet is the Sundarbans, which extends 80 kilometers (50 mi) inland into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps – here you find some of the last remaining areas of jungle, which once covered the giant plains.
The Sundarbans consist of an area of 3,850 km², with approximately one-third of the area covered by water and marsh.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses run from the bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, despite the fact that most, especially those buses going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since district buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Small Japanese coastal buses, both comfortable and robust, serve most districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapok River and connects Oyapock and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall, it is 378 meters high, and it has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational from September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay was the Guaraní group; they were semi-nomadic hunters, but agriculture was also their livelihood.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," became a country as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous people.
The colonization period, which lasted for 3 centuries, was started by the Spanish.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of the site's own character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams with some of the best players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament will be held in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
See the Asociación Argentina de Polo for news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The Falkland Islands pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands, with its value set equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley above the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what is an accepted method of payment.
It is difficult to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern part of the planet, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
The cold can be deceptive in winter, as the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but a combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There isn't really a "rainy season" and "dry" seasons: - the amount of rainfall is the same throughout the year.
Most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but nevertheless, the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
Bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack regardless of how peaceful they may look.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling meals and maintain a clean camp.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa in 1959.
When seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor in 1889, it became the infamous site of the sea protest.
Apart from one British cruiser, all the ships were sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful urban gathering led to the assassination of leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's 2 harbors, there are several beaches. The most popular are in 3 locations.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbour district are located in the Pacific Ocean. The beaches there stretch all the way from Long Bay in the north – to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are safe for swimming, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.

Sometimes you find crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. It is safe to swim.
The most important local beer is "Nummer en" (Number One), which isn't a complex beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that should be tasted, but wine from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
For people from Australia, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," cappuccino comes with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The cocoa lives up to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive, but fantastic.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef, and injuries rarely occur due to any of these things.
Nevertheless, heed advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and rivers from October to April north of 17°70'S. They can occasionally be observed outside of this period.
There are sharks, but it's unusual for them to attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean. Their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book accommodation in other areas, such as at a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies most often sell package deals that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even package combinations with flights and hotels.
They can also reserve a seat for you if you need time to think about an offer or obtain other documents for your appointment (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of security guards decide to camp on site, and most guards consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where the action is, you need to arrive early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that some parts of the festival may continue to play music late into the night, even after the music on the main stage has finished.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the cabin's location, as driving through ice generates an extreme amount of noise for those most affected.
Cruise to St. Petersburg includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos tend to make many attempts to maximize the amount of time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment for the guests, to keep them in good spirits and make them want to stay at the venue.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. But alcohol impairment reduces judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
The friction is low, so on icy and snowy roads you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to become trapped.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the largest form of tourism that attracts tourists to Africa and is the main focus for many visitors.
The term safari, in popular parlance, refers to trips to countries to see the magnificent African wildlife, specifically on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to approach vehicles and standard equipment, which allows for good viewing angles.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be quite shy, and you see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk" or "balance walk") involves hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be from August 24, 2021 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics. The city hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, the cancellation policies will not be extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
Most activity tickets are expected to cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets priced around ¥7000.
It can help to iron damp clothes to get them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if it's not in the room.
If an iron is unavailable or you want to avoid wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer instead, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorch marks).
There are various ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil the water for a minute, while in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you're in doubt, you can always buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter infectious animal diseases that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or in the worst case, lead to allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing people with their power, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from tax and can only be purchased in specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging conditions for driving on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh highway are on the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often passes through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, keep a cool head: there are many steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp curves.
Posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – typically 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h) – and it's even more important to respect them than usual.
Oddly enough, the cell phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty. In Bavaria, they are rich and varied, and can be compared to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with baked apples year-round, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Many of the popular cakes taste especially good with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but substantial pastries, try what, depending on the area, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry dish is based on herbs and spices, mixed with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid you include, a curry dish can be either dry or moist.
In inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is regularly used in curry dishes, while coconut milk is commonly used in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term, covering a wide variety of regional cuisines across the nation.
However, if used without further qualifications, the term usually refers to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now much is available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by lightly spiced dishes, with a dominant flavor of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hang down on each side of the saddle and are supports for the rider.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can be less safe due to the possibility of a rider getting stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with a foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged along by the horse if it runs away. Many precautions can be taken to reduce this danger.
Firstly, most riders use riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The largest climbing destination in Chile, the Cochamó Valley, is known as the Yosemite of South America, with many big walls and granite domes.
Rock climbing offers stunning views from the mountaintops. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in the endless oceans of rock faces.
Snow sports on downhill slopes, which include both skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve riding down snow-covered areas with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing holidays are a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depict skiers dating back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity also has other names such as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not include skiing in alpine style, or alpine climbing; the latter is performed in steep terrain, requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover greater distances than if you walk – but you'll rarely achieve high speeds without a heavy backpack on the tracks.
Europe is a rather small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several nations would mean multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, on the other hand, functions almost like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points again.
At the same time, you do not have to apply for a visa to each individual Schengen member state if you have a Schengen visa, and you therefore save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what kind of manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax agencies consider objects older than 100 years to be antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, including that the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques despite being newer than equivalent mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami people and also important for the trade culture for many with other professions.
Even though traditionally not all Sami people have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, while reindeer were mostly used as draft animals.
In our time, many of the Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered impolite due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate impressions of the Roma people.
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you plan to travel to, it may affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
You may also wish to consult authorities other than your own, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
An example could be that American citizens in the Middle East face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The guides are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The perspectives presented are often superficial, general, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all very serious weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social consequences, or loss of life.
Dangerous weather can occur everywhere in the world; there are various types. Weather patterns can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfires are forms of and effects of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, torrential rain, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena consist of blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Those who plan to visit countries considered war zones should receive professional training.
An internet search for "hostile environment courses" will likely turn up the address of a local company.
A course would normally cover all the issues mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last two to five days and involves acting, some first aid, and occasionally weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports where gender is not marked (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as variable.
In the period after September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have also become far more intrusive.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the beach, a reef, or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid current allows deep water to form there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which can be very problematic.
Once you get yourself out of the current itself, swimming back isn't any more problematic than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be dragged along again or, depending on your skill and whether you've been noticed, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the excitement phase isn't there in the same way as when moving abroad), it lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have particular difficulty readjusting to their own culture.
When you return home after living in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the old habits from your home culture.
The first time you traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, since they know the traveler has to adapt to a completely new country.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the most exciting things in the area for children is the pyramid's sound and light show.
The pyramids are visible at night, and you have the opportunity to see them in peace and quiet before the show starts.
Usually, you can always hear the sound of tourists and vendors here. The account of the sound and light is just like a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx is set both as a backdrop and as a narrator of a long history.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the highest number of bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest of them is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The area south of the peninsula is Ellsworth Land, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reappear and form the 360 km long mountain range that is the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
Mount Vinson summit has a height of 4892 meters and is located on Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, in the northern part of the Sentinel Range.
In remote locations with a lack of mobile coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
A satellite phone can usually not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, recreational boats, and also on expeditions that have remote data and communication needs.
You can get more information about connecting to this service from your local telephone service provider.
Receiving education while traveling is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is especially popular among graduating high school students, allowing them to take a gap year before university without weakening their education.
In many cases, embarking on a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your home country.
Typically, there will be a tuition fee that needs to be registered in this type of educational program.
Finland is a great destination for boating enthusiasts. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
A yacht is not necessary in the archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7th or 8th person.
Although this is similar for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (as in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
The vast majority of the distinct Baltic Cruises had an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a couple of full days in the historic city, and return to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore using ship excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some of the cruises have included Berlin in the brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea, and the trip there is therefore not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or if they've experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of; it's no different than other things that many people fear or dislike.
Understanding how the plane works and what happens during flight can, for some, help overcome a fear based on the unknown or on a lack of control.
Shipping companies get a lot of money for delivering things quickly. Time is often very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies use their own planes, but for smaller companies, it was problematic.
If they sent things by air freight, it could have taken days on some routes to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a hefty wad of cash for the privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this won't be cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can prepare to pay up to four times more than the standard economy fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of flyers who are willing to pay well to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. Romanian is the local language, but Russian is also widely spoken.
The multi-ethnic republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the 3rd largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. Izmir is the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good transportation hub.
Smyrna was formerly just an old city, but is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century square alongside old mosques and churches, even though the city has an atmosphere more akin to the European Mediterranean than traditional Turkey.
You can see the island of Eysturoy from the village of Haldarsvík, which also has an unusual octagonal church.
There are fabulous marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves in the cemetery.
It's worth spending half an hour strolling through the exciting village.
Northward, and not too far away, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known among foreigners after Lord Byron gave it a glowing review.
Scotturb bus no. 403 regularly travels to Sintra and has a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you should also visit the massive crypt, the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place of Marian art that is popular all over the world.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave, in addition to a place that has almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time here, and many more who loved those who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat this place with the dignity, solemnity, and respect that it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Please do not damage the area by marking or etching graffiti onto structures.
Barcelona's official languages are both Catalan and Spanish. Around half prefer Catalan, and most understand the language, but practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan because it is legally established as the primary official language.
Spanish is still used in public transport and other facilities, though.
Regular announcements at the Metro station are only made in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system with a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get ahead in Paris is still to behave as well as possible, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). That will make it considerably easier to get around.
The Parisians' quick facade quickly disappears if you show a little basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in extensive forest, mainly beech, spruce forest and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, differing soils, and varying levels of altitude.
The area is also home to a great many animal and bird species.
There you rarely find fauna such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owls, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie, together with several common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer shawls to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it is brightly colored, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men are required to wear trousers that go over the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the storage at the entrance, but the clothes may not have been washed after each user, so it may be less comfortable to wear these skirts. One size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil for everything.
A light and well-liked dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Slice with olive oil, tomato, and optional toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns that appear with the phrase "Sie for deg" always start with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is a significant method for being able to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It undoubtedly makes the reading easier too, even if the writing is a little difficult, since you then have to figure out if a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The capital letters to be aware of are c and g, as their pronunciation differs based on the following vowel.
In addition, you should pay attention to the fact that the pronunciation of r and rr is different: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and quite straightforward grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
If you already know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish quickly discover that Portuguese is close enough that you don't need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually a bit outdated in our time and are often used as museums or educational facilities.
Since light pollution wasn't the type of problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or near campuses that are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossoms on display have been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century and are also known as hanami.
The concept came from China, where flowering plum blossoms were the most popular flower.
The first cherry blossom festivals were held by the Emperor in Japan only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
The plants look their best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally laid out garden and pick some "samples," you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, it's a very easy place to get around, and you can get hold of most things there after you arrive.
However, if you are placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to consider both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which doesn't happen as often).
There are also a couple of buses that go north to the city of Hebron, to the traditional burial site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, which is located nearby.
Inland waterways can be a nice theme to base a trip on.
Visit, for example, the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions we have during the holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It's a tradition to stay awake through Easter night at an exposed point to watch the sunrise.
It may well have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual, but of course there are also Christian theological interpretations of this tradition.
Several traditional churches often hold the Easter service on a Saturday evening during the Easter holiday, with congregations often starting the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The mammals couldn't make the journey due to the long distance to the continent, and thus the giant tortoise became the first grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Many mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos after humans arrived, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, a time when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to discover the Aurora Borealis, as the sky remains dark more or less around the clock.
As the places are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you will also have the opportunity to see the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard work attire, and employees address each other by last name or job titles.
Teamwork is important in a workplace, with an emphasis on group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees often need to get their superiors' approval for any decisions they make and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
