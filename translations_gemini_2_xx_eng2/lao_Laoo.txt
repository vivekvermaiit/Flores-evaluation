A combination of experimental drugs known as ZMapp initially showed promise in trials, but formal studies indicated it had less benefit than hoped in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the US Olympic Committee’s letter and embraces the Olympic family’s expressed need to foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.

The widely disseminated theory not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also cannot provide general details of fossils, such as details about color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this wild animal is the color of Korean water on top, which fades, or is carotenoid-colored on the bottom.
The research also gives us a deeper understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaurs lacked a rachis, or a well-developed feather shaft, but possessed other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers suggest that the rachis was likely the last evolutionary development in the evolution of feathers.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that even if this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers for a mature individual and not a chick.
Researchers suggest that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows that the large animal had feathers and was not a chick.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The work is mostly theoretical, but a program is written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius constellation.
The effect the team is looking for may be caused by the gravitational interaction between the dark matter of the galaxy cluster and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a force on the Earth causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in much the same way that other matter does.
This theory states that the darkest matter in the universe is located around galaxies in a halo-like formation and is made of very small particles.

Candidates may send representatives to witness all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under the strict supervision of supervisors according to specific procedures.

In other Lao competitions, she finished tenth in the women's Giant Slalom team event with a combined run time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes behind the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who took first place, and 1:09.02 minutes behind Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four skiers were among a group of female athletes who failed to finish their run, and 45 out of 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police have recovered stolen laptops and phones.
"Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested all five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and computer."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their face covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
Nevertheless, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency services extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he received treatment at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya went to Edinburgh Sheriff Court after being accused of killing her son.
She is out on bail during the arraignment and the trial is not yet final, but any eyewitness testimony may be compromised because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in various places throughout the Kingdom, but Scots law operates differently, and the court viewed the publication of the photographs as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists appear to be at risk if they publish images and other materials of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the overall prosecution, has informed reporters that it will not comment until a charge is made.
The leaked documents reportedly refer to border disputes, with Palestine seeking to rely on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics mentioned included the future status of Jerusalem, which is revered by both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a military presence on the mountain for ten years when the agreement was signed, while the PA only agreed to leave it after five years.
The women involved in the pesticide control trial must be monitored more closely by forestry officials due to the ongoing monitoring of the trial and the evaluation of its effectiveness.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers are being deployed under the Sporting Shooters' Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Heritage Conservation with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial cull received safety briefings and supervised training.
Mr. Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It was Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Electoral Commission clarified the acceptance of the CEP previously as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
That commission was Martelly's response to anti-government protests that began in October.
Sporadic violent protests stem from election mismanagement, potentially dating back to 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions involving overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burn injuries to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said there have been 27 accidents involving those devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of excessive heat, which the company still considers "not serious."
The ministry responded to Apple's delay report by saying, "That's truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Marianas Northern Emergency Management Office said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication a tsunami would occur.
A Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages were rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Of the six hostages, including children and the elderly, a Filipino photographer was released first.
Afterward, the photographer took the seat of an old woman while she needed to use the restroom. Mr. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as a surgeon and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research has shown that if hormones are nurtured, it will help accelerate the lung development of the fetus.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators discovered two flight recorders, the "black boxes," on Wednesday.
The wrestling stable also paid compensation to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extreme, my first manager. Luna died on a night when there were two moons just as unique as her, and just as strong a woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented, “Luna was just as weird as I was…maybe even more so…I loved her and will miss her…hope she is in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that during the 2010 federal election campaign, she believed Australia should become a republic upon the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed shared the view that they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the latest survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist excelled in the 100m and 200m swimming events and in three relay categories at the Commonwealth Games, but doping allegations have cast doubt on his prowess.
He couldn't use drugs to overcome his pain caused by being banned from playing the game.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Many people confirmed the discovery of using different hardware and software in early February, and it was published on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for Earth, along with organic compounds that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo is 53 years old, he started his term of office earlier this year, and last month he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political banter and nonsense."
He was expected to assume the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while also reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, compared to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional special transport services, and overground trains will run non-stop at Wembley. Furthermore, parking and public transport drop-off/pick-up points will not be available on the ground.
Fears of transportation shortages have raised the possibility that the game will be forced to be played in a closed venue without team supporters.
Research published in a scientific journal on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorean Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species developed in just two generations, even though the process was believed to take longer due to hybridization between ground finches, Geospiza, and dried bark finches, Conirostris Geospiza.
Gold can be shaped into any form. It can be hammered into very thin sheets.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be twisted and woven, and it can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made thin and adhered to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used for decoration in paintings in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can measure its value using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical substance is acidic or alkaline.
pH level is measured by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Rub the dry ingredients together, then use clean, wet hands to squeeze them into round balls.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel strange and form a sort of outer shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had running water in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Besides, there were also ancient Egyptian, Persian, and Chinese toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women used together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, it means you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive signals and then immediately reflect them back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists will use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and some of our view.
It takes a large rocket, taller than 100 feet, to carry satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. Perhaps the greatest thing the wheel has helped us with is making transportation much easier and faster.
It brought us many trains, cars, and other transportation.
Below them are medium-sized felines that prey on medium-sized animals, ranging from rabbits to chevrotains and deer.
Eventually, many kittens (including lost pet cats) are eating large quantities of small prey such as insects, mice, geckos, and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of the cone, a special thing that each cat considers essential to keep it from competing with other cats.
Lions are cats that prefer to live in groups, and a large group is called a pride.
A pride consists of one to three related males, along with females and up to thirty cubs.
Women typically have close-knit relationships with each other within extended families of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of a pride of lions is similar to that of a pack of wolves or a pack of dogs, but surprisingly, even animals that behave similarly to lions (but aren't big cats) still fall prey to them.
Tigers are like all-around athletes; they can climb (even if they're not particularly good at it), swim, jump far, and possess strength equal to five times that of a strong human.
Tigers belong to the same genus (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four species of cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full roar of a lion, but it's more like a loud, drawn-out vocalization.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. They will catch lizards, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that wild cats hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists think that leopard cats track and find animals to eat (as prey) by scent, smelling where they have been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision and move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings, then pouncing.
When small groups of organisms (small populations) are separated from the main population they came from (such as if they move along mountain ranges or rivers, or if they move to new islands where they cannot easily move back), they often find themselves in different environments than they were previously used to.
This new environment has both different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be stronger competitors than they previously needed to be.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still require the same adjustments.
As time passes, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they start to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have become so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which refers to the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen for humans to breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (which is the breath we exhale).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from trees. Most of the food we eat is also plants. So if there were no plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the ultimate predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is lined with over 70 extremely sharp teeth, along with a special set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there's no escape once it crosses your path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have a forked tongue. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurus, and it may even eat people.
It also attacked anything that went into the water, even giant dinosaurs like T. rex were no match for it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans shared theirs with strangers, or unusual celebratory items included: wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women ate their meals on simple benches, wealthy men often held social gatherings, eating their meals with their own designated seating.
Ancient Roman cuisine is not included in the food that comes from America or from Asia to Europe at the end of this century.
For example: They had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which were considered the homes of the gods.
People would bring offerings to various gods, and the priests would try to fulfill the needs of those gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard, and the inside of the vihara (main hall) is a sacred space that only monks can enter.
Sometimes, distinctive stepped pyramids called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The very top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing is not very important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place in the open air.
A woman is cooking in the yard; the shops are simply stalls that open up with tables facing the street. Stone is used for building houses.
There are no large forests left in the land of Canaan, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse legends say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even disregarding his discovery, it would be seen that the Eskimo people were already living there at that time.
Even though each country has its own "Scandinavians," there are many differences between the people, kingdoms, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Even though there is something written on the back of that document, it's not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are "Original Declaration of Independence Dated July 4, 1776." That text appears at the bottom of the back of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days, the document, written on a large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches), was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is possible that the mark was added in the form of a symbol.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unfree.
It was ruled by "Vichy" France. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France in an assault known as "Operation Dragoon."
The Americans and Free French forces fought to liberate southern France and turned towards Germany in just two weeks.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, that is, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the word "civilis" in Latin, which means "civil," related to the word "civis" in Latin, meaning "citizen," and the word "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and moreover, it also defines the size of society.
City-states are the ancestors of various nations. Culture and civilization refer to the transmission of knowledge through generations, long-lasting cultural traces, and fair dissemination.
Minor subcultures often disappear, leaving behind relevant historical evidence and not being recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government—of which the Congress was the sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress has no power to levy taxes, and because it has no national executive or judicial authority, it must rely on the often uncooperative authority of the states to enforce all of its laws.
It also does not have the authority to repeal tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The aforementioned bill requires unanimous consent from all states before it can be revised, and the states are disregarding the central government because their representatives in parliament are frequently absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and also participated in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice skating, roller skating, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, and Italians have included them in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the 7th country in the world with the most islands!
Because Japan consists of a group of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as "the archipelago".
Taiwan's origins can be traced back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the East India Company, based in southwestern Taiwan, began to shift away from traditional rice production and hired Chinese laborers to cultivate their rice and sugar.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures named Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the complex buildings have been reconstructed so that tourists can initially understand how they originated.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was a prominent film camera size during the late film era.
Currently, it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
35mm format is the nominal format, but is often confused with the actual image dimensions of 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The ratio of this pattern (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be equal to 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS family formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, when misused and often mocked, is a simple guideline that strengthens and harmonizes an image.
It specifies that the most effective placement of the main subject in a photograph is at the intersection points of lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become a place full of wealth and power, was being scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the states of Europe together, despite differences in language and customs.
Its power of dissemination has affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the core beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and therefore, the church's financial funds are specifically designated for that reason.
The central governing authority of the Church has been in Rome for thousands of years, and its being a focal point of power and money has led many to question whether this doctrine was discovered or not.
Not long after the conflict erupted, Britain began blockading German naval communications by sea.
The strategy took effect by cutting off crucial military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated well-established international law codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
The UK is mining international waters to prevent ships from entering all parts of the ocean, which would cause danger to things including ordinary ships.
Due to the limited response to that strategy, Germany hoped for a response similar to unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitude of citizens and most countries was one of peace and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, many countries wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work with Edison in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents and his name, a book of poems, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China was unique in its dynastic cycles, with each era or ruling family being a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty were unstable periods of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars erupted between various high-ranking nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit at the highest point in the grand palace of Xi'an.
The social and political impacts are numerous, such as the adoption of the numbering system, the transition from absolute leadership to a democratic republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just one person.
Furthermore, after the revolution, it became an opportunity for all ambitious and successful male participants to advance to success.
The same goes for the military, because instead of ranking the army based on class, they are now basing it on ability.
The French Revolution continues to inspire oppressed and exploited working classes in other countries to rise up in their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave, which became known as "Hira," on Mount "Noor" (Light) for contemplation.
He entered the cave alone and survived, and time provided a clearer picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Resting atop a mountain in the north of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find, even knowing it exists. But once inside the cave, everything goes dark.
Nothing could be seen beyond the clear, beautiful sky overhead and the many mountains surrounding it. Very little of the world could be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramid structures built to worship the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (including the largest pyramid), smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor King Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "bow up" sign looks like a V, and the "down bow" sign looks like a bar or a rectangle with its bottom side missing.
It means you should start at the tip and push the bow, turning it down, meaning you should start at the base of the spine (which is where your hands are holding the bow) and pull the bow.
Usually, an up-bow will produce a softer sound, while a down-bow tends to create a stronger and more intense sound.
Don't feel pressured to put your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed slurs are for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, the formidable, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old) and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a mob of market women.
In the carriage procession they used to travel back to Paris, they were surrounded by crowds who cheered and threatened the King and Queen.
The rioting crowd forced the king and queen to open their car windows wide.
There was a moment when a member standing and waving, who was the head of security for the Royal Guard, was killed at Versailles right in front of the horrified Queen.
The cost of the American empire's war to conquer the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to offset a major portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street home banks.
Certainly, the immense profits from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people have fundamentally benefited U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which these events occurred is generally called the High Middle Ages, the peak of the medieval period in European history, during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide variety of ideas ranging in practice from technology push or technology needs to a rigid sense that human destiny is driven by underlying imperatives related to scientific laws and technological expression.
The predominant interpretations of technological determinism are divided into two general ideas: the development of technology itself along a largely predetermined path that transcends cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, having a tangible "impact" on society, rather than being a condition of society.
For example, one might say that automobiles inevitably lead to road development.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable with only a few cars, so a new production method has been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership also leads to a higher increase in accidents on roadways, leading to innovative new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged car wrecks.
Writing about love incorporates significant components of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In terms of romance, the landscape has shaped individuals, and over time, traditions and cultures associated with that geography have emerged, and these, consistent with the location of society, are superior to laws defined without reason.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was hailed as the fashion capital of Europe.
It was renowned as a center of luxury, which began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silks and spices, that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
Gothic style was most popular between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
The early stages of tailoring were heavily influenced by Byzantine Eastern culture.
Nevertheless, due to delayed communication channels, Western styles may be 25-30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop in its own way. One of the biggest developments at that time resulted from the Crusades, when people began using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture for producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is common, often organic, using varieties collected from nature, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define different subcultures may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often signal their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic features, including fashion, customs, and group-specific vocabulary.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who have experienced neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, and were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
Such children have been called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child is due to parents rejecting the child's severe mental or physical disabilities.
A child who is acting out might have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were accused of being raised by animals; some were said to live in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, feral children will exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost like the animal they are in the care of, especially such as fear or indifference of humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, there's an upgrade to take it a step further.
Scaffolding is not the method of learning, but rather a supportive aid for individuals who are experiencing new learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both realistic-looking and real. In other words, the teacher is making scaffolding but it's made from small paperclip art in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software and are designed to pose questions, prompt responses, and explain steps that may be challenging for students to manage alone.
Children are sent to foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even coercion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured, cared for, and educated, but they do.
We recognize that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is intended to provide safe housing, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Fostering is about anticipating providing everything necessary that was lacking in the home they came from.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as key motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal relevance" and "ongoing relationship" were also identified as criteria for creating new motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they explored audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in interpreting facial expressions that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, there are claims that it can be verified whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions or not.
In his essay on presidential rhetoric, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people unable to understand a speech due to brain damage could nonetheless accurately assess its sincerity.
He also pointed out that such ability to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: recessive and dominant.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection acts on the pool of available variation.
Segregation and recombination occur randomly between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for animals with digestive systems like humans to meet their essential amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Furthermore, the mistake of doing so has dire consequences: worsened depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily accessible plant sources would be the accessible protein in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Everything is considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep fragmentation is a process of purposefully waking yourself up during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This method can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to make you aware without fully waking you up.
If you find that you often snooze your alarm, try placing it on the other side of the room to force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options related to biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or teas known as diuretics) before bed, forcing you to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is related to the amount of stress in their body and mind.
The lower the ego, the better it is for the life force that exists. Everyone has the ability to find true peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of reaching this goal is our own stress and denial.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been expanded along the Mahayana path of love and with many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation practices, and a path of loving embrace.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the power of enlightenment) is awakened through yogic postures, breathing practices, chanting, and visualization.
The heart of Tibetan meditation lies in Deity Yoga. Through visualizing deities, purified energy channels are activated, chakras are opened, and awareness is cultivated.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the former Soviet Union and the United States of America. When the war ended, conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures caused the countries to separate.
With the two years that ended the war, old allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It will be prolonged for the next 40 years and will be fought for real by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgeheads.
However, these plans were almost abandoned overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian Front zones after the invasion of eastern Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The long-standing mission of the Navy is to ensure that your country can maintain its capacity to transport people and goods, while also interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this is the North Atlantic convoys of World War II. The Americans attempted to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy primarily used U-boats that were trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allied forces had lost, Germany might still have been able to defeat England, as it still had a foothold in continental Europe.
Goats are considered to be among the first animals domesticated, around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains region of Iran.
Ancient cultures and ethnic groups began keeping them to easily access milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats are generally kept in herds that roam the hills or other grazing areas, often herded by children or adolescents, similar to the widely known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Bowling alleys were built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though horse-drawn carts were made of simple wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them at higher speeds and haul heavier loads on slightly rough roads every day.
The thesis was presented rather quickly in order to conform to the format. However, it is known that slow tracking is more effective if there is iron on top.
This has become common practice, but the iron caused more iron to be put on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full-scale iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their early ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not regularly walk upright.
Bipedalism expertise is found in the remains of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years. Although, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can join environmental movements, and we can become activists to mitigate future hardships to some extent.
This is similar to treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary fix, we should look for the root cause of the problem and we should eliminate them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to human scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become greater due to human overconsumption and extravagant lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's print shop, located a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the Declaration by John Nixon in Independence Hall courtyard on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 attacks on Dunlap, known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. No original handwritten copies remain.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives on today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly and muscular feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs much like a T-Rex dinosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of data encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values: 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer terminology.
The poison inside may not be immediately apparent. There are various symptoms, such as nausea, which is a common symptom that cannot immediately diagnose the disease.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medication containers or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term "beetle" is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
This word originates from familiarity in the past with dust mites, which are highly adapted insects that are parasitic to humans.
Both mites and insects are colorless, adapting to living in the nests or habitats of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), considered a significant neurological disease that occurs in young adults and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research suggests that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in their children's best interest, to raise children.
This couple may choose to plan to adopt a child as their own.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights to the child, allowing another couple to become the child's legal guardians and raise them.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
It's not just experimentation and trials that are tests used to limit one or more possible hypotheses; questioning and observation are also approaches to research in science.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Acceptance is Aristotle's view on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, Westerners found themselves cut off from the philosophical and scientific roots of the Greeks.
Observed rhythms in physiology and behavior largely depend on the presence of external cycles and their generation through circadian clocks.
Periodic rhythms that do not simply respond to external cues have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining device that will continue to cycle autonomously even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment is one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses that eat bacteria, or bacteriophages, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to label the DNA of phages with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of phages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have varying effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are somatic or germline.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas with the purpose of experiencing beautiful scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting the park, and learning about the ecosystem.
Example of visiting, taking photos, and learning about event venues in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns in the countryside by car to go to their workplaces, passing others whose final work destination is where they just left.
In this mobile ride-hailing vehicle, everyone is connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Current science indicates that a high-carbon economy is driving life out of one of the stable states that fostered human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone in society who uses the transportation system almost always complains about it.
Among developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality on a similar level or bridges collapsing.
Why does the transportation system generate such complaints, why does it fail every day? Are transportation engineers unqualified? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent bounds. Therefore, traffic flow tends to be reasonably consistent and can be approximated mathematically.
To represent traffic flow better, a relationship has been established between three key aspects: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly has helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings flat against their body.
This is what gives them a little more space to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many believe the opposite, that the solar system moves around the Earth, including the sun (and other stars as well).
This seems perceivable because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width of six miles.
20 percent of the water flowing out of the world's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Even though pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
Modern Egyptians marvel at the monuments of their ancestors, which are over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is still a language used in everyday life that most people use for work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People knew about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, as these could be found in nature in their native form and were easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, so much so that he even theorized that they could transform into new matter to form the things we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that it contains many elements that are on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so much so that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, pencils are a good friend to many people when they come out.
It's sad that with the emergence of new writing methods, pencils have been relegated to a lesser status and used less.
Currently, the person writing the message is at a computer screen, and has never been near a pencil sharpener.
People just wonder what will become of the keyboard when new things come along.
A fusion bomb works on the principle of using energy from the fusion of nuclei with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy wheel uphill. Split the nucleus again and release some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are likely to break apart with little or no provocation.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It will be thinner in the low-lying areas and thicker in the hilly areas.
There might be more volcanic rocks near the coast because the Earth's crust is thinner there. It's easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what attracts or interests people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that change as they grow older.
These theories look into what it is about being human that makes people want the things they do, and what in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when managers start leading their former colleagues. One is that within the larger group, they try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance evaluations, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transfer becomes an unmemorable individual who feels he has to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
Ultimately, leaders must be held accountable for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often leads to division between the leaders and the rest of the team.
A realistic team is held to the same standard of excellence as a regular team, but there are slight differences.
Immersive team members will act as the point of contact for their physical groups.
Typically, they have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which their local managers may not understand.
The emergence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique component of authentic teams.
"The invisible team" is a management team to which individual members report. The invisible team will set standards for each member.
Why does the organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for bringing the idea of a learning organization into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across the organization's departments, creativity and innovation can be unleashed.
And the result is, the organization's process of working together to overcome obstacles leads to a revamped process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must foster a culture of innovation, as well as share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes accessing the Continuum as an approach used to help organizations achieve higher levels of operational performance.
Neuroscientific data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating perception, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it more concrete.
The relationship between neuropathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain impacts, injuries, wounds, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes never seen before.
This has given us a lot of data and documentation to create models that help us understand the various processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) is heavily implied in science fiction, AI has become a very important branch of computer science dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research on AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent operation.
Examples include controls, planning, and scheduling to enable responses to customer diagnoses and questions, including handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focusing on solving real-life problems.
Currently, AI systems are being used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are being built into many home computers and video game software programs.
Field trips are an important part of every classroom. Teachers often like to take students to places where buses aren't an option.
Technology offers a way to solve problems by simulating real-world travel. Students can view physical artifacts from museums, visit aquariums, or appreciate fine art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a realistic study trip is also a good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital; each year the website is updated, but the old versions are still kept as a yearbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with strange grammar and spelling, the public eye tends to change that.
Since students are the most important target audience, the blogger started trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
The blogger "also encouraged students to have a greater understanding of the world around them." The need to cater to the interests of readers has stimulated students to be clever and attentive (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the regular school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to online material, students can identify their own position in other people's writing as well as formulating their own perspective on a particular issue (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming city in Canada, a bilingual capital with art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things, and beyond, highlight Ontario as being considered the heart of Canada from an outside perspective.
The vast area to the north is sparsely populated, and some places are arid and uninhabited.
For a population comparison that is quite surprising: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations or affiliated with France and are known as luxury beach destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to various lands and spread it widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to India.
In the north, it borders the Sahel, and in the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: Advise all female tourists to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear rings, just not rings that look too expensive.
Women should recognize that cultural differences may result in variations in what they perceive as abuse, and it is not uncommon to comply with things like being grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The religious leader of Morocco established a new city called Daru l-Badya, which was later named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping anywhere in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of glasses, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from Mount Nyiragongo, which covered much of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
While Goma itself is relatively safe, visiting areas outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for comparatively inexpensive gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical price (locally) is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for a remote, exotic place.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of encroaching sand from the desert.
It was one of the important stopover locations during the filming of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, "Africa's Great Civilizations".
This city differs radically from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 distinct eco-friendly zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most attractive tourist destinations and is also considered a key site within South African National Parks (SANParks).
The park charges a conservation fee and a daily entrance fee, similar to other national parks in South Africa.
It may also be beneficial for those who purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to the national park of your choice in South Africa and all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island has made the Hong Kong territory famous and is a place that many tourists consider a primary focal point.
The arrangement of buildings that shapes Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a shimmering topographical map created by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon on the opposite waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along its northern shore.
This is a former British colonial site that has been reclaimed, so if you're looking for evidence of past colonial territories, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland into Bangladesh and rural India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A portion of the forest within Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just swamps — they include some of the last remnants of this vast forest that once stretched all the way to the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans area covers 3,850 km², of which about 1/3 is covered by water/wetlands.
The Sundarbans National Park has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is currently estimated to have a population of 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, with the most frequent departures being buses heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, which leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because intercity buses often get full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most cities are served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby locations like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two-story building is 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance from the bridge deck is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
This bridge is scheduled to officially open in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní people are an important indigenous group that currently live in eastern Paraguay, subsisting as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is inhabited by other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In 16th century Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born from the encounter and conquest of the Spanish with the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish initiated a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year is being held in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Competitions and smaller tournament rounds can also be viewed here at various times of the year.
For news about the tournament and where to buy tickets for the polo tournament, see the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at parity with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island located in Stanley, directly opposite the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
Regarding credit card use, they may not be accepted on remote islands, even if British Pounds and US dollars are used; inquire with the owner in advance to determine acceptable payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a humid subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common.
Winter can be surprisingly cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is consistent throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park have become accustomed to humans watching wildlife in its natural habitat, wildlife should still not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how intimidating they may seem, bulls, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain a safe distance. These are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that various smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing odorous foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of an embarrassing naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave port.
All the boats sank, except for one British tourist boat, in which over 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's two harbors, with the most popular ones being in three regions.
The North Shore beaches (in North Harbour city) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all beaches with safe swimming and shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive is located on the Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes family beaches crowded with people and lined with many shops. Swimming is safe.
The popular local beer is "Number One." It's not a complex beer, but it's enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
Many French wines are good and worth having, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might be even better.
The tap water in this area is completely safe to drink, but if you're concerned, bottled water is readily available as well.
For Australians, the idea of "weak white" coffee is foreign. Strong black is "espresso," cappuccino comes with cream (on top), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The juice is expensive but excellent.
Trips to the coral reefs happen throughout the year, and injuries from the coral reefs are rare.
Stop, follow the instructions of officials, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and in rivers from October to April in the north in 1770. They can sometimes be found offshore during this time.
Sharks do exist, however they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives tourists peace of mind knowing they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have special deals on hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency as well.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combinations with flight and hotel packages.
They can hold it for you if you need time to think about the offer or arrange documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any amendments or requests should be processed through the tour operator first and are not the direct responsibility of the hotel.
For some festivals, most attendees of music festivals decide to camp, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the show, you have to go in early to get a campsite close to the stage.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage may end, some parts of the event may continue playing music until late.
Some festivals have special camping areas set up for families with children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, check your cabin because the force of passing through the ice makes terrifying noises for those most affected.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include time in the city; cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits are difficult to find.
Usually, they often have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to put guests in a good mood and to keep them on the premises.
Some places have alcoholic beverages. However, drinking intoxicants is a bad decision, and all gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or cross mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very cold temperatures.
On roads with cold weather and snow, the friction is low and you can't drive like you're on asphalt.
During a blizzard, even a small amount of snow can be enough to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or frost or ice on the vehicle's windows.
Conversely, cold and snowy weather is normal in many countries, and most transportation continues as normal throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist draw in Africa and a highlight for many travelers.
The word "Safari" as commonly used refers to a land-based tour showcasing the scenic wildlife of Africa, particularly in the Savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and birds, are likely to approach vehicles, and standard equipment will help provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bushwalking," "safari hiking," or simply "walking") involves hiking, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the Olympics in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a messy situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies will not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Tickets are expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry faster. Many hotels have ironing facilities and irons available for loan, even if not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't wear nicely ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the silk get too hot (because it will shrink, or in more severe cases, the fabric may burn).
There are many different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective at combating specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for about a minute is enough, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have varying levels of effectiveness and can be concerning, so you should consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with in their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, trigger allergies, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Contagious or infectious diseases that come from animals and are dangerous, which can cause people to be injured or die, are generally not considered epidemics.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Tourists traveling to countries with high taxes can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, with frequent climbs and descents through remote mountainous terrain.
If you've never driven on rural roads, be aware of steep, narrow, and winding roads ahead.
The posted speed limits are lower than in the sections before and after – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence is paramount.
Surprisingly, cellular service is still better than many other routes, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
The Bavarian dialect is quite good and in Bavaria is quite varied and diverse, similar to their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apple pies available year-round, and cherry and plum pies appearing in the summer.
Many German pastries often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with strong coffee.
If you want to eat delicious pastries, you have to try the local specialty called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.

They offer more stability for riders but can raise safety concerns due to the potential for riders to get stuck in them.
