USA Gymnastics acknowledges the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and agrees with the Olympic family's core requirement to foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, are likely to be best served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than decertification.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur was reddish-brown on the upper side and pale or carrot-colored on the underside.
This recognition also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central stalk, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers concluded the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not fluffy downy feathers of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult-sized feathers and not small chick feathers.
A car bomb that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty others.

They came to realize that the Sun worked on the same basic principles as other stars: the activities of all stars in the system were found to be governed by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to meridional circulation.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less likely stars are to be active with respect to magnetic variability.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but a program was developed to simulate the perspectives made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of galaxies and the dark matter of the Pleiades.
Just as the moon exerts force on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert force on the Sagittarius Stream.
Scientists were able to conclude that a black hole affects another black hole in the same normal way.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located near the galaxy in a light-like manner, and is made up of numerous small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, then place a pre-printed ballot indicating their candidate of choice in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter register.
French electoral law instead codifies the matter. Strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are added except those of voters who have been counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following a specific procedure.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who violated the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his child.
He is in remand prison awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be badly affected because his picture has been widely published in many places.
This is customary elsewhere in Britain, but Scots law operates differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of photographs as prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says "journalists appear to be taking risks by publishing photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which oversees prosecutions, has indicated to the media that no further comment will be made at least until charges are brought.
That document, according to rumors, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding the continuation of a military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA (Palestinian Authority) is only agreeing to the removal of that presence in five years.
Those aiming at the target in the extra experiment to control distractions were to be supervised by guards, as the experiment would be monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were enlisted under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Conservation and Heritage, the four designated marksmen selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEO as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the administration that began in October.
The protests, which sometimes turn violent, were triggered by the lack of elections, another of which was delayed since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of defective iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burn injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of excessive heat emission, which the company said were "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "very regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said that no damage was reported in the nation.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat.
A former Filipino police officer has kidnapped Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of the old woman because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was attacked with bullets.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and joined the medical profession.
She trained as a midwife and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone was used, it would accelerate the growth of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found the plane's 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow boxers also mourned him.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. As unique as they come. A tough woman."
Justin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as fragile as me… maybe even more so… love her and you’ll miss her… hopefully she’s in a good place.”
Of the 1,400 people who were polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 corporate election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In a plurality of votes, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness has been in doubt.
He couldn't take the medication needed to relieve his pain because it is banned in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the invention using different hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
There is a possibility that comets were a source of transporting water to Earth, along with carbon-based substances that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumor as "noise and political stupidity".
He considered running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims would allow aircraft to use shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and cutting carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to traditional ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There is no extra transport being put on, and the overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley, and car parking and park and ride facilities are not available there.
The fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the creation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though this process was believed to take much longer, due to interbreeding between native Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortis, and immigrant large ground finches, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into different shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled to make sheets.
It can be made extremely thin and hammered onto other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of a chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders then, with clean, damp hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will be affected by the outer layers, which you will feel differently and will form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had modern toilets in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the townhouses of Minoan Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women mingled together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a phone call and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
A satellite was sent into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
You don't need a huge rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easy and fast transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other transportation equipment.
Below it, there are more cats of medium build that prey on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to bushbuck and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral and pet cats) that eat small prey that is abundant, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a specific task that each cat holds and that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are among the most social of the cat family, and they live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides are formed of one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually the ones who are very close to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump very far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The leopard is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, tiger, and jaguar. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The roar of a leopard is not like the loud roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of rebuke with words delivered loudly.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that wild cats hunt are smaller than them.
Scientists believe that wild cats track and search for prey (windo) by scent, sniffing to find where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark and with night vision, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small number) becomes separated from the larger population they came from (such as by crossing mountains or a river, or by moving to a foreign island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were originally in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different components or practices to be stronger competitors than they previously needed.
The original population has never changed, they still need the same original methods.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to appear more and more different from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and make our clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurus.
Its massive jaws held over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meaning that anything that met it would not escape.
We don't really know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have possibly been a cannibalistic creature.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a large dinosaur like T. rex would not have stood a chance against it.
While we are familiar with many of their foods, the Romans had their share of surprising or unusual banquet items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich people preferred to have feasts together where they would recline on their sides while eating their food.
Ancient Roman diets would not have included foods that entered Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have maize, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a principal temple, which was regarded as the house of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to address the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open outer court and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped tower structures, called ziggurats, were built as part of a temple complex.
The upper part was the sacred dwelling of the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not very important.
A large part of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women did their cooking in the yard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used to build the road.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was sold at a very high price.
Greenland had few people. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further West, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence is written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". This writing is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was folded for storage.
Therefore, the added quote is likely meant as a symbol.
The landings on the day of the attack and the subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces attacked southern France, an attack called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a unified culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil" or "related to citizens," which is connected to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and which somehow describes the size of a society.
City-states precede nations. Civilized culture signifies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a cultural footprint that endures over time with equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government – with the Continental Congress as its sole component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on the authority of the states, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
It also did not have the power to ignore laws and tariff lists between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the island groups that Japan possesses, Japan is often called, from a geographical perspective, an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history began a long time ago in the 15th century when passing Portuguese sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many houses on the edges of those complex buildings were rebuilt to give tourists a better picture of what they were originally like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the main film size in the classic cinema era.
It is still produced to this day, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, to some extent, confusing, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of this structure (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is then said to be 3:2.
Many common structures (the APS family of structures, for example) are similar to or approximately the same as this ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates tension while maintaining balance within the composition of a picture.
It states that the location with the greatest impact on the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the provinces of Europe together despite their different languages and traditions.
His pervasive influence affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial resources exist specifically for that reason.
The main authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth in one place led many to question whether this ideology was being properly implemented.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was effective in cutting off key military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the sea, thus endangering even neutral vessels.
Since there was little response to this tactic, Germany expected similar reactions to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of citizens and many nations was one of conciliation and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations longed to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in America with only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous employment) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time; each era of China or each ruling family was a specific dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty was an unstable period of divided kingdoms. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms of Han and Jin.
During these periods, fierce battles took place between nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying fighting for the highest seat in the palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from dictatorship to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just one ruler.
Also after the Revolution, work was open to all male applicants, thus allowing ambitious and successful men to prosper.
Similarly for the military because instead of military power depending on class it now depends on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply drawn to things beyond this ordinary life. He would frequently visit a cave that came to be known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the times, offers a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find at all, even if someone knew it existed. Once you enter the cave, you are completely cut off.
Nothing else can be seen except for the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of the massive structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "caret" symbol looks like a V and the "floor" symbol like a clamp or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow usually produces a soft sound, while the lower bow is more powerful and stable.
Feel free to pencil in your own fingerings, but remember that the printed fingerings are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, filled with dread, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
In a horse-drawn carriage, they traveled towards Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who screamed and shouted threats at the King and Queen at the top of their lungs.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their car.
At one point a member of the crowd waved the head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The U.S. imperialist war effort in the victory against the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to finance a large part of the expenditures and interest on bonds placed in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Undoubtedly, the immense profits derived from the long-standing exploitation of the Filipino people formed a foundational income for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the order's creation.
The period in which the events occurred is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a phrase that encompasses various perspectives in practice, ranging from technological imperative, or the advancement of technology, to the notion that humanity's future is governed by a fundamental logic tied to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many accounts of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path more or less beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has “impacts” on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially shaped.
For example, someone might say that automobiles lead to the development of roads.
However, the national road system is not economically viable for just a few vehicles, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to many road accidents, which in turn leads to the innovation of new techniques in treating broken bodies.
Romanticism had a significant aspect of cultural decisions influenced by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Rome, geography shaped the people, and over time traditions and customs related to geography arose, and these, being in harmony with the nature of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of Byzantine Europe.
It is known for being a center of luxury that began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its condition deteriorated during the twelfth century, especially because of the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were of higher value than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was influenced by Byzantine cultures from the east.
However, due to poor communication channels, Western fashions lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is a type of agriculture that is practiced for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that utilizes saved and indigenous seeds suitable for the local area, along with crop rotation or simple alternative techniques to improve yields.
Historically, many farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
A subculture brings together people of similar minds who feel alienated from societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Small subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, geographic, or a combination of elements.
Members of subcultures often signal their membership through unique styles that include clothing fashions, behaviors, and language.
One of the most popular techniques used to illustrate the importance of cooperation is to use a few tragic examples of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not involved/engaged with adults as they grew up.
Children like that are called "cruel" or violent. Some cruel children are locked up by people (usually their own parents); in other cases, this abandonment of children resulted from parents rejecting a significant mental or physical deficiency in the child.
Children who don't touch may have experienced severe abuse or trauma in their childhood before being released or escaping.
Some are alleged to be intimate with animals; others are said to live in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely like those of the specific caregiver animal, such as its fear or agitation towards humans.
While basic project education should make education easier and more enjoyable, mentorship goes a step further.
Training techniques are not a method of studying but a service that provides assistance to people who are going through a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Platforms can be both explicit and virtual; in other words, a teacher is a type of platform, but so is that paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual platforms are embedded within the application for the purpose of questioning, persuading, and explaining procedures that may have been too challenging for a student to handle alone.
Children are placed in Foster Care for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even robbery.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't educate, doesn't care, doesn't teach, but they do.
We believe that the Foster Care System is a place of safety for these children.
Children's homes should provide safe shelter, loving caregivers, a solid education, and a reliable healthcare system.
Children's homes should provide all these needs that were lacking in the homes they were initially removed from.
The internet mixes group communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the network lead to more considerations regarding usage and satisfaction methods.
For example, "learning" and "collaboration" are suggested as key catalysts for internet usage (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational components when they examined audience response on websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in micro-expression analysis, fleeting facial movements that last only fractions of a second.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can discern if a person is lying by interpreting subtle cues correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess the truth accurately.
He even suggests that such an ability to interpret human behaviors may be shared by animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two categories of gene variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation increases genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Changes in assortment due to segregation and recombination back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for large animals with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy their amino acid requirements from the available plant matter.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Readily accessible plant resources would be proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for higher mammalian groups like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In comparison, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality protein rich in essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their “protein problem” in ways similar to those that savanna baboons do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking up intentionally during your normal sleep and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using an alarm clock that doesn't make a lot of noise to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself repeatedly snoozing your alarm, it might be best to place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other behavioral options involve drinking a lot (especially water or tea, a popular remedy) before bed, which forces a person to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely related to the level of stress within their body and spirit.
The lower the attraction, the more positive the life force present. Everyone has the ability to find more peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can gain understanding. The one thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded with the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and numerous techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-embracing love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra or sound repetition, and visualization.
The heart of Tibetan thought is the Yoga of the Divine. Through the visualization of various deities, energy pathways are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of transformation is awakened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, a clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to the separation of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies turned into enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would actually be fought by proxy forces, in theaters of war from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian borders after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods in large quantities was the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods by sea.
The traditional role of a navy has been to ensure that your country has the ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, preventing your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
Meanwhile, German forces, using submarines, were trying to block this traffic.
If the Confederacy had failed, perhaps Germany could have defeated England as it had defeated Europe.
It is likely that goats began to be domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Generally, domestic goats began to be herded in groups that roamed the mountains or other grazing areas, while being managed by guards who were often children or young teenagers, similar to well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Horse-drawn carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks were filled with parallel tree logs, they allowed horses to pull them faster and haul reasonably large loads over the rough roads of the day.
Sleepers were introduced fairly early on to hold the rails in place. However, as time went on, it was discovered that the rails would function much better if a piece of metal was placed on top.
This became a custom, but the iron caused damage to the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation is walking; humans began walking upright about two million years ago, following the emergence of upright humans.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as a matter of course.
Bipedalism expertise is found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs approximately seven million years ago.
We can start living as good environmental friends, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce future stress to some extent.
This is similar to treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't just want a short-term solution, then we ought to get to the root of the problems, and extinguish it.
It is very clear that the world has changed significantly due to human progress in science and technology, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and wasteful human lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, the draft, handwritten and signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlop Leaflets".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides with the spark of attacks known to exist are the oldest copies of the document available. The original handwritten copy does not exist.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Nearly all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in a binary format.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
A clear sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
The word insect is used by entomologists in the formal application to this group of bugs.
This word comes from an ancient familiarity with the Bedbugs, who have a great skill in hosting humans.
Assassin bugs and bedbugs are known to live in the nests or habitats of their hosts.
Across America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or the interest of their child, to raise the child.
These spouses can choose to create a parenting plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that other parents can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine the way the universe operates using scientific methods. In fact, this method guides many scientific studies.
She is not alone though, experiments, and testing are the measurements used to eliminate one or two possible theories, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers illuminated traditional texts, and in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge dwindled, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many followed a pattern in physiology and behavior that often depends on the presence of native periods and their production through biological rhythms.
Regular rhythms, which are not simply a response to regular external signals, have been recorded in many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain a self-generated cyclical period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the proposals that DNA was the hereditary material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label the viral DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the viral protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only changes in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while changes elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for recreation and scenery, including plants and animals.
Examples of ecotourism activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about great apes in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in rural areas in cars heading to work, passing others who are heading to work from where they came.
In this robust transportation vessel, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system reliant on private vehicles.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has dislodged the Earth's climate from one of its stable states that was supposed to sustain human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear the same levels of complaints about water quality or the decay of bridges.
Why do transport systems place sentiment on such complaints, why do they fail every day? Is it that transport engineers are incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, researching traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with some consistency; therefore, traffic jams have some stability and can be represented statistically.
To represent traffic flow well, a relationship has been established between three main states: (1) flow, (2) density, (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of intelligent transportation systems.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to easily evade predators and easily find food and mates.
Many insects are fortunate to be able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them ample opportunity for small creatures to hide from their enemies.
These days, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and not other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes six miles wide.
Exactly 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction with stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical quality of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the pyramids of their predecessors, which were then already more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent nation in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language used by many of those who work in government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can all be found naturally in their native state and are easily extracted using rudimentary tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, proposed the idea that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements. Those elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was like the four states of matter (in that same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new things to create what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as Calcium and Potassium are considered to be metals. In reality, there are other metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so many trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, that pencil became a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerge, the pencil is relegated to a lower status and less frequent use.
People now write messages on computer screens, never needing to use a stylus.
One might wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
This fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required in the creation of nuclei with a large number of protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy boulder up a mountain. Splitting the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to disintegrate even with the slightest disturbance.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is known as the crust.
The Earth's surface is about 70 kilometers wide up close and 100 kilometers wide from a distance.
The soil under the maria is thin, but heavy under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories aim to understand what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are rooted in how they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want, and what aspects of their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when supervisors begin to lead their former peers. On the one hand, they will try to identify as "one of the guys" (or women).
This type of manager usually has difficulty making decisions that are unpopular, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, delegating tasks, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone turns into an unrecognizable person who feels that they must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, it is the leader who is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of a team.
That behavior often causes divisions between leaders and the entire team.
Reserve teams are held to the same standards of quality as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
A virtual team member often serves as a point of contact for their physical group at that time.
They often have more freedom than regular team members because their teams can meet according to differing time zones, which may not be understood by their management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique aspect of virtual teams.
"Invisible team" is a management team where each member reports. An invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why does an organization go through a lengthy process to establish a training organization? One goal of putting training organization concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the organization's high-performing departments, innovation and excellence can emerge.
As a result, the organization's process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new and innovative process for serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Value Chain approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a high level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical perspectives on cognitive investigation. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research, making it more specific.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies enables us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and resources to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often associated with science fiction, Artificial Intelligence forms a very important part of the branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in AI includes automating machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and coordinating, the ability to respond to customer recognition and queries, as well as text, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become distinct disciplines, aiming to provide solutions to life's problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they have been built into several home computer programs and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher likes to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers solutions through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or enjoy fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Participating together in a virtual farm tour is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future travelers.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol; each year the website is updated, but older versions remain online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also enhance a student's writing. While students may begin their blogging experience with grammar and spelling problems, the presence of a general audience changes that.
Since students are the most important audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid being criticized.
Blogging also "forces students to be knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's desire encourages students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their reading beyond the normal school day.
The effective use of blogs "can enable students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can identify their position in the context of other people's writings as well as express their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a captivating and bilingual Canadian city, boasting an array of art galleries and museums brimming with Canadian history, both past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north is the undiscovered beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more show Ontario as it is naturally perceived as Canadian, both internally and externally.
The vast areas in the upper north are sparsely populated, and some of them are uninhabited wilderness.
To the surprise of many, there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, close to the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most autonomous island continent when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as coastal resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the areas, and it greatly influenced the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route around the Cape from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that any female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also important to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm in refusing people, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, don't make it right!).
The current city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Close to the old Medina, it's easy to find areas selling Moroccan cultural products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of geegaws, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which covered many of the town's districts, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as offering the easiest routes for tracking Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The typical fare for locals is 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Despite its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for foreign lands that are very far away.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS African Wonders of the World special.
That city is in a difficult comparison with other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic influence than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 distinct ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all National Parks in Southern Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees.
It can be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to some South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong area its name and is a major focal point for many tourists.
Hong Kong's skyline-building series is paired with a pleasing bar chart, likely formed by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To best experience Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that British colonists considered their own, and so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial era of the area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland in Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining great forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans are located in an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which one-third is covered by water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district central bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Since buses connecting districts are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets several days in advance.
Many districts are served by small, comfortable, and reliable Japanese-made Coast buses.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel in nearby areas, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Those two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs inspection stations are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, initially known as "Giant Province of the Indies", was born following confrontations between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain its character and indigenous identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest match of the year will take place in December at the polo grounds in Las Canitas.
Competitions and minor matches can also be seen from here at certain times of the year.
For information regarding tournaments and where to buy polo match tickets, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is valued at par with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
Generally, British pounds are accepted anywhere in the islands, and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
In the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be taken; check with owners in advance to find out what payment method is acceptable.
It is impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when the Northern Hemisphere is cold, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30ºC are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature very rarely goes below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rainy" or "dry" seasons: rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals are, in any case, wild, and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how calm they seem, bison, elk, hartebeest, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of tourists are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and maintain cleanliness in the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a famous standoff with the navy in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British ship. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggles organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in town led to the killing of high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, owing to the presence of two harbors and Auckland. The most popular are located in three parts.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Nearly all the beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them have shade under pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket areas of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that sometimes get crowded, with a range of shops on the beachfront. Swimming is safe.
The main beer in the area is 'Number One', it's not a complicated beer, but it's good and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many types of French wine available, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel better.
The tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easier to get if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of 'white' coffee is foreign. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino comes piled high with cream (not foam), and tea is prepared without milk.
Hot chocolate reaches Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the rock are made throughout the year, and injuries from any cause on the rock are rare.
Still, take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Marine worms occur near the coast and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They may sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, although it is rare for them to attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live much in the sea, as their primary habitat is the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking early gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive.
Travel agency companies often have special deals with hotels, although you can find the possibility of booking other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agency companies usually offer deal packages that include breakfast, transportation plans to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also put a hold on it for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other travel documents (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must be processed through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, a large number of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and many consider it to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you will need to wake up early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even after the music on the main stage ends, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until midnight.
Several festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, inspect the cabin area, as driving through snow causes terrible noise for those most affected.
Sea cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. These passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos typically make extensive efforts to maximize the money and time spent by gamblers. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits are often difficult to find.
They often have unique food, drinks, and entertainment offerings to entertain guests and take care of them on their premises.
Some venues offer alcohol indoors. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in elevated areas or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and extreme cold.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can't drive as if you're on bare asphalt.
During heavy icing conditions, enough ice to stall you can accumulate in a very short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are common in many nations, and transportation continues year-round without disruption.
Perhaps safaris are the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The word safari means to travel to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move closer to vehicles and normal equipment, allowing for better viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as "bushwalking", "trekking", or going "on foot") involves walking, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some competitions will take place in different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most coronavirus-related waiver policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets costing approximately 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards for hire, even if one is not staying in a room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the cloth is not too hot (as it can cause shrinkage, or in a worse case, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some being effective against specific threats.
In some other areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, several minutes will be needed.
Filters vary in performance, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying your water in a completely sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they do not recognize from their home areas.
Pests can damage food, cause nuisance, or in severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force, do not usually qualify as pets.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods without taxes and duties in specific areas.
Travelers in countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on goods like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated, wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be alert: steep inclines, narrow paths, and sharp bends abound.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than those of older and later sections—typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour)—and strict adherence to them is more important than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, the mobile phone service is stronger here than in other trail networks like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is very good, and in Bavaria, it is even better and different, just like that of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit fillings are common, with apples cooked into fillings year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in the summertime.
Many German baked goods contain almonds and nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but excellent fritters, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Biryani is a dish made with rice, spices, and meat or vegetables.
Turmeric can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In areas of mainland North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in spicy gravy; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a blanket term that encompasses the huge variety of cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualifiers, the word tends to refer to food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The most common food found across the wider archipelago is Javanese cuisine, prepared with simple skill, its basic flavor being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Footpegs are supports that hold the rider's feet and hang down on either side of the running boards.
They give the rider great stability but can be a safety concern due to the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse bolts. To mitigate this risk, several safety measures can be taken.

Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered ground on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity with many participants, who are often known as "ski bums," planning entire vacations to ski in a specific area.
The idea of snowboarding is very old - cave drawings depict snowboarders from as far back as 5000 BC!
Skiing started at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to but not usually associated with downhill visits in high mountain snow or mountaineering, the latter being done on a slope and requiring a board and hard boots.
Think of skiing as an analogy for climbing.
In good condition, you'll be able to cover a significantly greater distance than walking – but you will rarely find skating speeds in rural areas without heavy equipment on previously traveled paths.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Normally, traveling through so many countries would mean having to apply for visas and go through passport control frequently.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in relation to this matter.
It's better if you stay in this area, you can cross the borders without going through passport control areas again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.

Advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often quick, generalized, and oversimplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.

Rip currents are currents of water that flow back out to sea from waves breaking on the shore, usually in a channel or similar area.
Due to the underwater topography, the returns tend to concentrate in localized shallow areas, and high-velocity wave action can build up there.
Many deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, a situation that can be difficult.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skill or if you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.

Finland is a great place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal areas.
For archipelagos and islands, you don't necessarily need a ship.

Boating is an international sport in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is in line with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite different (for example in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).

If you only go to the beach using cruises, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin and Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a trip to this city is not included in the price of the cruises.

If they had sent the items by air cargo, in some ways it might have taken several days to complete the unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations wouldn't allow them to send cargo without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to travel first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the opportunity (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, this does not come cheap: due to obscure and unfavorable regulations, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy, business class fare, and 11 times for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a specific group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are adapting accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The native language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.

The sudden outward appearances of Parisians will quickly melt away if you show some basic respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded, especially with beech, fir, and pine trees, and a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean mountain range vegetation.
It has a diverse range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, varying soils, and altitudinal variation.
