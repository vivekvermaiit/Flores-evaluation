The USA Gymnastics Federation supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and agrees on the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) statement that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served. This can be done by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization, rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the proportion described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone unnoticed for so long and embraces any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory already, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
This discovery also provides a better understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers lack a fully developed central shaft, called a rachis, but nonetheless exhibit other characteristics specific to feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers have deduced that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not chick down.
The scientists clarify that it is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty others.

They found that the Sun worked according to the same basic principles as other stars. The activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
Regarding magnetic reversals, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way it affects normal matter.
According to this theory, the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo and is made up of a large number of small particles.

"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the large caves on the planet that maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the earth," according to Glen Cushing, a member of the USGS (United States Geological Survey) crew and staff at Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth in private, place a pre-printed paper ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officers verified his identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French electoral code regulates operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no envelopes are present at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

Her other race, the giant slalom, allowed her to finish in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who came in first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who came in ninth.
In the women's sit-ski category, four skiers failed to finish their run; regarding the giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in that race did not manage to be classified.
Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Additional Inspector General D.K. Arya stated, "We have arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we have recovered her phone and laptop."
The defendants are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused individuals had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed to allow emergency services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is currently in police custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony may be compromised as her picture has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and courts have deemed publishing photos to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Attorney's office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will concern the border dispute that Palestine claims based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
Among other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents to a period of five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial were to be closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Head of Park and Wildlife Conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first culling campaign have been properly trained and instructed in safety procedures.
Yesterday, Martelly inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at setting the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which were supposed to have taken place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of defective iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry reacted by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damage was reported in the country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
Her research demonstrated that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the baby's lung maturation.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as I am… maybe even more so… I love her and I will miss her… I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election revealed that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view and hope that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents think Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition has been called into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as it was prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and foster life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor at the beginning of this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is thought that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technologies, rather than the ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Extra transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fear of transportation shortages raised the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden indicated that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was previously estimated to take much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortis*, and the immigrant large ground finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is what is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, damp hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 30 meters tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in many ways. The greatest benefit it brought us was making transportation much simpler and faster.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are mid-sized felines that eat similarly sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
Furthermore, there are many small cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a specific task assigned to each feline, preventing them from competing with one another.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The prides are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as around thirty females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their family being composed of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like wolf or dog packs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is unlike the lion's full roar, but rather like a sentence whose words are screams and growls.
Ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing their trail on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots stalk their prey by blending into their environment before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
The population of origin hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered as belonging to the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, expire).
Plants produce their food using the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, fearing nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 teeth as sharp as razor blades, as well as an additional series of teeth in the palate, ensuring that anything that crossed its path could not escape.
We aren't sure, but it's possible he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for it.
Although the Romans ate some of the same food we know today, they also consumed some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, as well as the dormouse, a type of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and women ate their food sitting on chairs, rich men liked to organize banquets together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin, which were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's dwelling.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary that only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple complex.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The majority of life for the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has been sparsely populated. Scandinavian sagas recount that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, that he found Greenland—and named it so—by traveling further west.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian," there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there's an inscription on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, one could read the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the great parchment (which measures approximately 29 and three-quarter inches by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French of Vichy, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon".
In barely two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning large city or city-state and also indicating, in a way, the size of the society to which it refers.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its acts.
He also did not have the power to deviate from tax laws or those on customs duties between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the group of islands that make it up, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago."
The first information regarding Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through the area mentioned it under the name Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings bordering the complex have been rebuilt to offer tourists a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most widespread film format at the end of the era of analog films.
It is still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the photographic sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, and quite disconcertingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, it's said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to this aspect ratio or closely approximate it.
The rule of thirds, often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while providing protection to the image.
He indicates that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was challenged.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1000 years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this doctrine was being upheld.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral vessels.
As this tactic had elicited only a tepid response, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations displayed a tendency towards pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to prevent such a situation from ever happening again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different eras; each period in China, or each family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between numerous members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, trades were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, as the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the scope of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. When you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
Above, one can contemplate nothing but the clear and magnificent sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, one can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, encompasses several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the most imposing), numerous small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "push" symbol looks like a V, and the "pull" symbol looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
The top means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up bow generally produces a softer sound, while a down bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were yelling and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to have the windows of their carriages opened.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The American imperialist war expenditures in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the order's creation.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – a period in European history spanning from the 11th to the 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself unfolds according to a process largely beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that is intrinsically rather than socially determined.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of healthcare to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to Romanticism theories, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and a culture linked to that geography emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by the society, were considered preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until approximately 1100.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was during this period that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication methods, Western fashions could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the era, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using saved seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "feral" or wild. Some feral children were locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability from which the child suffered.
Feral children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When feral children are raised entirely by non-human species, they exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but rather a way to help learners who are discovering new instruction, such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little Clippy paperclip man from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to question, guide, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, including extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is meant to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered major factors promoting internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions lasting only a few milliseconds.
It is often claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," pointed out how people unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination cause variations to alternate between the two pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large quantity of protein containing all the vital amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep procrastination is the process of intentionally waking up during your sleep period and then falling back asleep shortly after (for 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, in order to make you regain consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids before going to sleep (especially water or tea, known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by numerous techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. It is through the visualization of different deities that energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the awareness of awakening is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods, and cultures ended the entente between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real confrontations, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional job of navies has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term shepherds. These pastoral methods are still practiced today.
"Wagonways" were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks for wagons were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The crosspieces were introduced early enough to hold the tracks in place. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron band on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ("upright man").
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as a matter of course.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign with the aim of mitigating future suffering.
In many cases, it's a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed a great deal thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more significant due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs, given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have legs covered in scales and equipped with claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like T-Rexes.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is likely the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from a long-standing familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may very well believe that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's, to be responsible for the upbringing of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the context of an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only way; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations, but it also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline in knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue to cycle for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germline cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism appeals to people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, especially the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go see, photograph, and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns by car to go to their workplaces and pass other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
That gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Some thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km in width.
No less than 20% of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were in awe of the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since antiquity, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, as they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that the latter transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys containing a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, are also found.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing methods has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and less frequent use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when the next innovation arrives.
A fission bomb works on the principle of converting energy by assembling a nucleus from a myriad of protons and neutrons.
A bit like making a heavy cart climb a hill. By splitting the nucleus again, and then releasing a bit of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on researching what makes people feel good or what they are attracted to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what motivates certain people to want the things they want, and what in their environment encourages them to do, or not do, certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. One end of the spectrum involves trying to remain "the good buddy" (or the good pal).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary actions, perform evaluations, delegate responsibilities, and hold others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything the group has created up to that point and do things their own way.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to impose upon itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives linked to putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new and innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore allow us to narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, lesions, tumors, and traumas affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks requiring an intelligent approach by machines.
Examples include controlling, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being implemented in various home computer software and video games.
Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not feasible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational field trips. Students can view ancient artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a stunning work of art all while remaining seated with their class.
Actively participating in an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a yearbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try out blogging with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author is beginning to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to spark public interest encourages students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"When used properly, blogs "can allow students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their opinions with those of others and express their own points of view on very specific subjects"" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a wealth of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south, you'll find Niagara Falls, and to the north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings, which boast unspoiled natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider the quintessential Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and practically a continent in itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the islands, and this religion spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape route connecting Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman traveling should say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which shouldn't look too valuable).
Women need to realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviors they consider harassment. It is indeed common for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing advances from men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had rebuilt it after destroying it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and trinkets of all kinds, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the fighting that persists in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as for some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking treks in Africa.
You can use "boda-bodas" (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for faraway and exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS show "Wonders of the African World."
The city contrasts sharply with cities in the rest of the country, as it possesses a style that is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern border.
The park's total area is 19,500 km², which is divided into 14 ecozones, each harboring a specific fauna.
This is one of the best-known amusement parks in South Africa and considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees for the park.
It can be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card, which grants access to certain parks in South Africa, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the main point of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that outlines the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar graph, revealed in reflection by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront located opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that British colonists invested in. Therefore, it seems like a good starting point if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not solely composed of mangrove swamps: they also hold some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one third is covered by water/marshland.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and you can find around 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (located on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it's advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal freighters, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived primarily through fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly nicknamed "the giant province of the Indies," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous populations.
The Spanish initiated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Furthermore, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organized here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to purchase tickets for polo matches, consult the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the neighboring islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currencies may be. Discuss payment methods with the owners in advance to come to an agreement.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange it before leaving.
As Montevideo is located south of the Equator, winter in the Northern Hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, and summer temperatures exceeding 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There aren't really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is fairly constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
However docile they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't kept a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering held in town, during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
Auckland has many beaches because it straddles two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very popular with families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming there is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," a rather ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There's also another local beer called "Manta."
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can safely drink the local tap water, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "café crème" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Numerous trips to the reef are undertaken throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would steer clear of them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through travel agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transportation, or even packages combining flights and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other necessary documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any modification or request must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp on-site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be closely involved in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-located camping spot.
Don't forget that even though the musical performances on the main stages are over, other musical performances may continue until late into the night at other festival locations.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as traversing the ice can cause unbearable noise in the most exposed cabins.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. They rarely have windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They generally offer special deals on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and keep them on the premises.
On some sites, locals offer free alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know it's crucial to stay sober.
Anyone driving to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to block you in.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is practically uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist draw in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In common parlance, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African soil, and particularly in the savanna, with the aim of witnessing the striking spectacle of wild animals in their natural environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to the cars, and the standard equipment allows for good observation of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "walking safari," or "footing") involves hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having previously hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be facing a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
By ironing damp clothes, you can dry them more easily. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if there aren't any in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you can find one.
Avoid overheating the fabric (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it needs to be done for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that they are not familiar with from their region of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or, in the most serious cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some areas, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and tight curves are common.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than before.
Conversely, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common there: apples are baked and used in pastries year-round, while cherries and plums make their appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but filling pastries, try Berliner doughnuts, also called Berliners, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid," depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the northern inland regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands, Indonesia boasts an incredibly diverse culinary landscape, making "Indonesian cuisine" a broad term encompassing a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifier, it tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices being the predominant flavors favored by the Javanese.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, hanging on each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: indeed, the user's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large walls and varied granite cliffs.
From the heights of the peaks, the panoramic views of the mountains are breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new practicable paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless.
Downhill winter sports, particularly skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," who organize their entire vacations around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: some cave paintings showing skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing, or ski mountaineering.
It resembles alpine touring and mountaineering, but generally doesn't incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as you would a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover distances a little greater than on foot – but you will very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries. In typical circumstances, traveling through several countries therefore involves having to apply for multiple visas and undergo multiple passport checks.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply separately for a visa for each member country of the area, which saves time, money, and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition for determining whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on the location; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than that in effect in Europe.
Handcrafted goods can be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Even though, according to tradition, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, while mainly using reindeer as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is a major source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma, the term "Gitan" is often considered pejorative due to its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to a travel advisory issued by your government, your overseas health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Very unfavorable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can take many forms, depending on the geographical, topographical, and atmospheric characteristics.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Extreme weather phenomena, both regional and seasonal, include cold snaps, blizzards, and sand or dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to inquire about the risks of inclement weather that may affect their destination region, knowing that this can impact the routes they are planning.
Anyone considering travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Training Courses" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much greater detail, usually with hands-on experience.
Training normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, plenty of first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few and far between.
Travelers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not indicate gender (X) or updated documents to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is equally variable.
Security checkpoint searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transsexual individuals should not expect to go through scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents that flow back from waves breaking on the beach, often over a shoal or similar feature.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current towards deep water can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you're out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again. It's also possible that, depending on your skills and whether or not you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock happens earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who struggled to adapt to the new culture sometimes have a very difficult time readjusting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
In the beginning, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you can always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The sound and light show's story is like a history book.
The Sphinx is positioned as the backdrop and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains blend into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth mountain range, 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches a height of 4,892 m.
In remote locations, with no cell phone service, you may have no choice but to resort to satellite phone.
A satellite phone doesn't usually replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
This is a service frequently used in navigation, including recreational craft, as well as by expeditions that require remote data transmission and telephony.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those planning a gap year have the opportunity to learn through travel, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This option is particularly popular with young people leaving school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken gap year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your own country.
As a general rule, there is a registration fee to participate in these educational programs.
Finland is a prime destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also boasts thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in archipelagos and on lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed big enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it's a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a few full days while coming back to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see by consulting the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea at all, and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's no need to be ashamed of it: it's no different from the personal fears and anxieties that many people feel about other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Shipping companies are well compensated for making fast deliveries. Often, in the context of urgent repairs, the matter of delivery time is crucial for the documents, goods, or spare parts involved.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for smaller companies, there has been a problem.
If they had shipped goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to clear unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel first class or business class is to shell out a large sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for it).
However, this isn't cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it's pointless to try to get discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that they can count on a certain type of traveler who is willing to pay a premium for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no member state of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transit hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center, situated around a vast bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping malls are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures representing doves on some of the tombs.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk in this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located to the north, is easily accessible and was made famous to foreigners by Lord Byron's glowing account of its splendor.
Scotturb bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
When heading north, be sure to visit the superb Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a place known worldwide for the apparitions of Mary.
Don't forget that you are essentially visiting a charnel house, as well as a site that has an almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their time here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because the law establishes it as the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in numerous languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is still to behave at your best, to act like someone well-mannered. This will make your travels considerably easier.
The Parisians' brusque exterior quickly melts away if you show a minimum of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country possesses a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils, and elevation levels.
The region is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When women visit a monastery, they must wear skirts covering their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive without one, but if you bring your own, and it features bright colors, you'll be rewarded with a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Just as men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, followed by the word "Sie" which means "you," always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
One can also say that it facilitates reading, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the necessity of knowing whether a verb or an adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Please also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" distinctly: "caro" means "dear," while "carro" means "cart."
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it's not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not as much of a concern in their time as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, making them easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous infrastructures placed in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one".
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, taking "specimens" will also get you expelled without question.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive.
But, located in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to adapt to the (constant) heat and strong sun exposure (when the sky is clear, which is less common).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're planning to take goes to Hebron and not just the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube, or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with these holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is traditional to spend Easter night awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands originally did so by water, either swimming or on floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance separating them from the continent, mammals were unable to complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, numerous mammals have been introduced, notably goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to admire the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for practically the whole day.
As the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
The attire consists of classic work outfits, and employees address each other by last name or job title.
Workplace harmony is crucial because it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to get approval from their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without questioning them.
