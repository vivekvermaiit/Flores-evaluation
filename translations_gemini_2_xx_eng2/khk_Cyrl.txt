Not only does this prove that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but the widespread theory demonstrates that fossil remains cannot create color or three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers are brown on the chest area and have colorless or pigmented colors on top.
This discovery also provides a deep understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Researchers have concluded that the rachis (the central shaft of a feather) is a later evolutionary development, as dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed rachis (also called a quill) but possessed other features like barbs and barbules.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers also stated that although it's a young dinosaur's tail, the feathers are those of a mature animal, not a hatchling.
Researchers said that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows that it is feathers from an adult dinosaur, not a chicken.

In France, voting traditionally has had little to do with technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper with their candidate of choice into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of eligible voters.

Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the ballots under high supervision and according to a specific procedure.

Four female cross-country skiers were unable to finish the race, and out of a total of 117 skiers participating in the mass start event, 45 were not ranked.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Assistant Detective General D.K.Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered their mobile phones and laptops."
The individuals accused in the case are Baba Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Captain Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that these individuals attended the court hearing with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
Despite that, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
Emergency responders had temporarily closed the road at the accident site when they extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been prosecuted in Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the widespread printing of his image may adversely affect witness testimony.
This is a common practice somewhere in England, but Scottish justice works somewhat differently; the court considered the release of the photo to the public to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University noted that "if journalists publish suspects' photos, they are walking a dangerous line."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the entire investigation, has informed journalists that it will not be making any comment until at least the lawsuit is filed.
This document, according to what has been revealed, relates to the desired Palestinian border dispute based on the borders before the start of the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, a land considered inviolable by both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding that armed forces be stationed in the valley for about ten years if the agreement is signed, while the PLO has agreed to abandon such combat conditions in just five years.
Forest rangers will closely supervise the sharpshooters involved in the case, as they are overseeing the supplementary work of controlling agricultural pests and assessing its effectiveness.
Within the framework of cooperation between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), skilled volunteers have been recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flinn, acting director responsible for protection and heritage at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa's (NZGSA) park, the four shooters selected for the initial culling operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday to the newly formed nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC).
This is Martel's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Committee suggested that the resignation of the Evidence-Based Policy Development Committee would be part of a comprehensive measure to move the country in a new direction.
The committee was Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Some violent protests stemmed from the failure to organize elections that were supposed to happen since 2011.
Reports indicate that around 60 defective iPods overheated, six of them caught fire, and four people sustained minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they are aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had called 34 cases of overheating "not serious."
The ministry responded that it was "truly regrettable" that Apple was postponing its report.
An earthquake occurred on Tuesday at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM Friday GMT).
Northern Mariana emergency officials say no losses have been reported to the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage on a bus in the capital city of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Among the six hostages released first, including children and elderly people, were Filipino photographers.
The photographer later took pictures of the elderly woman's apartment who needed a restroom. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied to be a midwife and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggin began researching premature births in his free time.
His research showed that if hormones are administered, it accelerates fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua news agency reported that government experts recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the original Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with a double moon. She was truly unique, just like no other. A strong woman."
"Luna was as weird and strange as me... maybe even more so... I loved her, I will miss her... I hope she went to a better place," wrote Dustin "Gold Rush" Russells.
In a poll conducted with 1400 people before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
Similarly, 34 percent of respondents also want to keep Queen Elizabeth II as Australia's last monarch.
Regarding the extremes of the opinion poll, 29 percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent said Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist swimmer was supposed to swim in three relays, the 100m and 200m freestyle at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his request, his training is questionable.
Because he was banned from competing, he couldn't take the medication he needed to relieve the pain.
Curtis Cooper, a computer science professor and mathematician at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
In early February, a group of people, using various hardware and software, confirmed the discovery and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets, with their organic matter that creates proteins and supports life, may be the delivery source of water to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage into law.
He called the rumors "political drivel and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration says the NextGen system will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
This system uses satellite-based technology, compared to older ground-based radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No extra transport is provided, and open trains do not stop at Wembley; park-and-ride facilities are also not available at the venue.
The fear stemming from a shortage of transportation has increased the likelihood that this competition will be played behind closed doors, without team supporters.
A study published in a science journal on Thursday reported that a new species of bird is emerging in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species developed in just two generations due to interbreeding between the Darwin's finch and the cactus ground finch found on Daphne Major, although they believe this process took longer.
Gold can be formed into all sorts of shapes. It can be flattened into tiny figures.
It can be turned, flattened, and drawn into a thin wire. It can also be hammered or folded like a sheet.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It can also be made extremely thin and is sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical substance is.
pH is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in a chemical substance being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together with clean, damp hands and then compress them into a ball shape.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layer, creating a strange feeling and a kind of film.
Almost every household in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a modern sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan city of Crete and the houses of Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of public baths where men and women bathed together in mixed company.
When you talk to someone thousands of miles away, you use satellites.
Artificial satellites in space receive your call and almost immediately reflect and understand it.
The artificial satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and phenomena.
A massive rocket needs to be over 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the round Earth in amazing ways. The greatest thing the wheel has given us is a simpler, faster means of transportation.
This brought us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Following those, come the mid-sized cats, which prey on medium-sized game ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including fluffy pet cats) that eat a wide variety of small prey such as insects, voles, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success was a concept of a cattery where each cat had a specific job they could do without competing with the others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
Females tend to have close bonds with each other, forming large herds of females.
A pride of lions is remarkably similar in behavior to a pack of wolves or dogs (but not other big cats), posing a deadly threat to their prey.
A perfect athlete can climb like a leopard (even if not that good), jump long distances, and pull things with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only species that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's full-throated roar, but rather like angry, screaming words being spoken in sentences.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all animals that wild cats catch are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track animals (prey) by their scent, sniffing the ground to find where they have been, and then hunt and eat them.
They have excellent night vision, allowing them to see well in the dark, and they can also move very stealthily. The wild leopard cat blends into its environment and hunts its prey by ambushing it.
When a small group of animals separates from its original species (in cases where they migrate to mountainous regions, river basins, or new islands and cannot return), they often have to adapt to a different environment than before.
This new environment, with different resources and different competitors, will require the new population to have distinct characteristics or adaptations to become stronger competitors than what was previously needed.
The core population hasn't changed at all and still needs the same adaptation as before.
As time passes, and as the new population adapts to their new environment, they gradually begin to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process of new things arising speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (yes, exhale).
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also create shade.
We build our houses with plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to live either.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time and feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
His long jaw, armed with over 70 sharp teeth and an extra compartment at the back of his mouth, is like a prison from which nothing that enters can escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. In terms of food, it included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
This animal apparently attacked anything, even gigantic dinosaurs like the T-Rex, which were completely unsuitable prey for it, and also went into the water.
Most of the Romans' food is familiar to us, but they also shared strange or unusual foods such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the forest dormouse.
There was another difference in that poor people and women liked to sit on chairs and eat, while rich men liked to sit together and eat their meals, enjoying banquets.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had none of corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built major temples for each of their gods, which they considered to be the god's home.
People bring offerings to the deities, and monks try to attend to the deities' needs through festivals and celebrations.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctum that only monks can enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temple complexes.
There was a sacred place dedicated to Buddha on top of the tower.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked their food in their yards, and the shops were just open stalls facing the street. They used stone to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely valuable.
Greenland has a sparse population. Norwegian sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were significant differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think about the treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even though something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4th July 1776." This inscription is written upside down along the bottom of the document.
No one knows who wrote it, but it has been established that this large leather document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was originally stored in scroll form.
So, notes are simply added as symbols.
The D-Day operation and subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part remained unliberated.
This part was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who, in the 1940s, befriended the Germans and collaborated instead of fighting the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies occupied southern France, and the operation was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, Allied forces liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany, with the Americans and French in the lead.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a specific large group of people or a society that lives and works together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "of a citizen," which in turn comes from the Latin word civis, meaning "citizen," and civitas, meaning "city" or "state of a city," and it also defines the scope of society in some way.
The state of a city is a sign of its people. Civilizational culture embodies the idea of passing on knowledge through generations, preserving cultural traces, and distributing them equitably.
Minority cultures often disappear, absorbed without leaving behind relevant historical evidence, and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government due to the fact that it consisted of only a Congress under the Articles of Confederation.
The power to levy taxes was lacking in Congress because there was no national executive or judicial authority, thus enforcement of laws had to rely on state authorities who did not cooperate much.
It also did not have the authority to abolish interstate tax laws and tariffs.
Before any amendments could be made to the agreement, unanimous consent had to be obtained from all provinces, and because the provinces took the central government too lightly, their representatives were often absent.
Along with the German national football team, the Italian national football team is among the second most successful teams in the world, having won the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more common in northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
The Japanese occupy almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the Japanese archipelago, Japan is geographically referred to as a "group of islands."
Taiwan's history begins in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated efforts to change the indigenous people's crop processing practices, employing Chinese laborers in their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, including the Temple of the Sun or Intihuatana, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings are built on the periphery of the complex to provide tourists with a better understanding of how it originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format on Earth is 35mm, which was the dominant film size as the analog film era came to an end.
Although it is still manufactured to this day, more importantly, its aspect ratio has been used in digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, as it is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to yield the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common encodings (e.g., APS encoding groups) are approximately equal to or close to this visual ratio.
The rule of thirds, which often involves mocking and ridiculing, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
This defines that the most effective part for the main subject is located at the intersection of the image divided into three horizontally and vertically (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity held together the nations of Europe, which were distinct in language and customs.
From the very beginning to the common people, this had a strong impact on everyone.
One of the core Christian beliefs is the idea that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist, in particular, for that reason.
The church's central administration has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has likely led many to question whether that belief is being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of war, Great Britain initiated a blockade of the German navy.
Cutting off vital military and civilian supplies violates several international agreements made and accepted over the past two centuries, but the strategy has proven effective.
By mining in international waters, Great Britain endangered even neutral ships, preventing any vessel from entering any part of the sea.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, the German navy anticipated a similar response in their U-boat warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the dominant attitude among many citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the cruelty and horrors of World War I, nations became determined to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and agreed to work for Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former work manager).
In ancient China, there was a unique way to represent distinct periods; each Chinese period or ruling family was its own kingdom.
It was an unstable era where states were divided between powerful empires. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Throughout these periods, brutal and fierce battles took place among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands upon thousands of people dying for the chance to sit on the high throne in the imperial court of Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolute monarchy to nationalism, and the transition from libertarianism to the idea that the nation belongs to the people, not to a single individual.
After the revolution, all jobs became open to male applicants, giving the most ambitious and successful the opportunity to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of being based on class, army ranks are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He would frequently visit a cave known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Nur" (light) to meditate.
Sitting in the cave where he was able to remain until this point gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual talents and interests.
That cave, located on the peak of a mountain north of Mecca, is entirely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even though I knew such a thing existed in reality, it probably wouldn't be easy to find. Complete isolation only happens when you enter the cave.
Only a clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains are visible. From inside the cave, one can only see and hear a small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
Egypt's Valley of the Dead near the Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward-pointing caret" symbol looks like a V, and the "downward-pointing caret" symbol looks like an inverted V or a square.
"Up" means pulling the string from the tip of the bow, and "down" means pulling the string starting from the loop (the part of the bow you're holding with your hand).
Upward-facing bells generally produce a softer sound, while downward-facing ones produce a louder, more energetic sound.
Please annotate in your own way, but since the markings are related to music, they should generally be taken into consideration.
Seized by fear, King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forcibly driven from Versailles to Paris by a group of marginalized women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
A group of people caused the King and Queen to leave the window of their carriage open.
Before I knew it, a member of the group was waving the head of the King's Guard, which had been killed in Versailles, in front of the terrified Queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the costs of the U.S. imperialist war to conquer the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to cover a major portion of the costs of the US colonial regime, and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government freely fluctuated through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the long and protracted exploitation and oppression of the Filipino people constituted a core income for US imperialism.
To understand this stupa, one must understand the idea that motivated its creation and the sequence of its construction.
The period in which the event took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages are the period between the Early and Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of practical ideas, in a strict sense, suggesting that human destiny unfolds through a logical path related to scientific laws and their technological manifestations, stemming from technological impetus or importance.
Most translations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development follows its own path, independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology, in turn, "impacts" societies in ways that are fundamental rather than incidentally conditional.
For example, one could say that the motor undoubtedly contributed to the development of roads.
Despite this, the national road network is economically unfeasible for only a few vehicles, so a new production method is being developed to reduce the cost to vehicle owners.
Widespread car ownership leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, and also drives the development of new healthcare technologies for repairing bodily injuries.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural definition, drawing inspiration from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the scope of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and as time passed, traditions and culture related to that geography, intertwined with society, were superior to arbitrarily established laws and regulations.
While Paris is recognized as the capital of modern world fashion, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
This city was famous for being the epicenter of luxury, starting around 400 BC and lasting until around 1100 BC.
The city's status declined in the twelfth century as crusaders returned with money and spices more valuable than those offered in Byzantine markets.
During this period, events took place that shifted the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture had a significant influence on fashion in the Orient.
Despite this, communication channels were slow, causing Western fashion to lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, one of the biggest developments of that time was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a system that is simple, often organic, and eco-regional, which maximizes yields by preserving the seeds of its own crops, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel unacknowledged by societal norms, allowing them to develop their individuality.
Subcultures can be unique due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and the gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination thereof.
Subculture members often express their unique style in a symbolic way, encompassing fashion, methods, and peculiar expressions.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to consider the few cases of unfortunate children who were not socialized by being neglected, experiencing misfortune, or being deliberately abused by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were confined by people (often their own parents); in some cases, abandoning such a child was related to the parents' unwillingness to accept the child's severe mental and physical defects.
Aggressive children are more likely to have experienced child abuse or emotional trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Others say animals brought them; some even say they lived in the wild on their own.
When non-human animals raise a child, the feral child almost entirely exhibits the behavior of those animals (within the limits of their physical capabilities), such as their fear and indifference.
Project-based learning should make the learning process easier and much more interesting, and progressing is one step beyond that.
Scaling is not a learning method but rather a form of support that helps people undergoing new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The hierarchy can be virtual or real, that is to say, a teacher is a form of hierarchy, but so is a tiny paper man who works in the Microsoft office.
The virtual ladder is located within the software and is designed for students to ask about and clarify procedures that may be difficult to work through alone.
Children are placed in temporary care programs for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even intimidation and robbery.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where they are not educated, nurtured, cared for, and given an education, yet this situation persists.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, consistent education, and reliable healthcare.
Caring for other people's children aims to provide all the needs and requirements that the children were unable to receive in their previous household.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive nature of the internet leads to an added dimension in terms of usage and benchmark trends.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as key motivations for using the internet (James et al. 1995).
Aigmeir and MacCord (1998), while studying the reactive effect of personal involvement and "ongoing relationship" on consumer websites, also identified it as a new aspect of activation.
The use of video recordings has led to the important discovery of microexpressions, or facial movements that last only a few milliseconds, being deciphered.
It is believed that one can detect whether a person is lying, especially by accurately translating facial micro-expressions.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks described how people with brain damage who are unable to understand speech are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He believed that even animals like pet dogs possess such skills in interpreting and translating human behavior.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two genetic variation pools: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variants and the option to remove them from the pool of expressed variants.
It is necessary to allocate, reallocate, and coordinate resources between funds on a periodic basis.
In the savanna, it is difficult for baboons, which have a human-like digestive system, to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth stunting, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based resources to find are leaves and legume-based proteins, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal feed (ants, horse ants, eggs) not only digests easily, but also provides a high amount of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
Looking at everything, it shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors managed their "protein problem" in a way that, in some respects, resembles how monkeys in the hot jungle obtain their protein today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then sleeping for short periods (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively silent alarm clock to gently bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself snoozing your alarm, placing the clock on the other side of the room can force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-rhythm based methods include drinking plenty of fluids (especially diuretics like water or tea) before bed and forcing yourself to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses is proportional to their physical and spiritual efforts.
The less anxiety there is, the more positive the life force that exists becomes. Everyone has the capacity to find absolute peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing hindering this goal is our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is enriched by the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal loving-kindness.
Kundalini yoga and Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) are awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Perfect Enlightenment. Through visualizing various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is generated.
Germany was the main enemy in World War II, which led the USSR and the USA to become allies. As the war ended and the system collapsed, the processes and culture led to the division of countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
The Cold War was expected to continue for another 40 years, with proxy armies actually fighting in many different places from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had been broken, so their only hope was to retreat under the protection of the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize.
These plans became almost instantly obsolete because after the Soviet Union, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and many other bilingual and multilingual international treaties, occupied the eastern territories of Poland, more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered, forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is probably the most efficient way to move a large number of people and goods across the sea.
The task of a naval force is traditionally to guarantee its own country's people and goods can be transported, while also confronting the enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
The most famous recent example of this was the Battle of the North Atlantic in World War II, when Americans tried to send their troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At that time, German submarines, mainly using U-boats, were trying to stop this movement.
If the Allies had lost, Germany, which had already occupied the rest of Europe, could have been able to conquer Britain.
Goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran approximately 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes raised goats to easily obtain their milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats are typically grazed in herds on hills or other pasturelands, and are usually herded by children or adolescents, more broadly known as shepherds. These livestock herding methods are still used today.
Rail wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon road consisted only of parallel logs, it allowed horses to accelerate and drag larger loads on somewhat difficult roads.
Railway sleepers were introduced quite early on in order to build roads on the ground. Gradually, it was realized that a road with a piece of iron on top would be more efficient.
Even though it was a common experience, the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagon more.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. The first complete iron railway was introduced in 1767.
The first means of transportation we know of is walking. With the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright"), humans began walking upright two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossil remains dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, while Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, join environmental movements, and even become activists to reduce future suffering to a certain extent.
In many cases, this is just symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and deactivate that root.
It is quite evident that the world has changed significantly due to the advancements in human science and technology, and problems are becoming increasingly larger due to overpopulation and humanity's extremely wasteful lifestyle.
On July 4th, after Congress began implementing it, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Printed at 150-200% size throughout the night, it's now called a "Dunlap page."
John Nixon first read the document on July 8 in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he had it read to his troops on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The known 25 surviving copies of the first printing of the Declaration of Independence are the earliest extant versions of the document. No original handwritten copies remain.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and exists today. We call them birds.
People don't think of themselves as being the same as dinosaurs just because they have feathers and can fly.
However, many species of birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have scales, clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
In reality, all computers used today are based on the complexity of information coded in binary form.
A binary number, i.e., can only have one of two values: 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits, and are used in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are often general enough that they do not allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning might be an open container of medicine or a household toxic chemical substance.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
Entomologists use the term "insect" to formally name insects in this group.
The term originated from an ancient association with fleas, blood-sucking insects that live on humans.
Assassin bugs and ticks live in their nests, and are adapted to living in nests or houses in their place of origin.
Across the United States, with approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), it has become a leading neurological disease for young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their or the child's best interests.
These couples may choose to make a plan to have their child adopted.
When a child is adopted, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, thereby allowing another couple to raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works through scientific research. This evidence-based approach is the most scientific research.
This is not just one thing, but an experiment is to conduct tests, and an experiment is to ask questions, make observations, and guide scientific research by eliminating one or more possible hypotheses.
Natural scientists and philosophers pay attention to classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
He accepted all of Aristotle's ideas on all things scientific, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, Westerners discovered they had become disconnected from the fundamental philosophical and scientific roots of Greece.
The rhythms frequently observed in the body and behavior are endogenous cycles, the creation of which depends crucially on factors such as their biological clock.
Circadian rhythms, which don't simply respond to external cues, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is an autonomous signal generator that maintains free-running cycle periods even in the absence of external cycles.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key experiments that suggested that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to transfer their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments: labeling phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The significance of a mutated genetic segment of a cell and its consequences vary depending on the type of mutation and whether the affected cell is a bacterial cell or not.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be passed on to offspring, and other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy phenomena that include wild flora and fauna.
Examples of activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about ecosystems.
One example is to visit Borneo, take pictures, and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, people pile into their cars from small towns and settlements and head to work, passing others whose work keeps them in the places they just left.
Everyone is connected in some way on this dynamic transport aircraft, and they support a transportation system based on private cars.
This massive carbon economy has driven the biosphere out of its stable state, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you'll occasionally hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why does the transportation system generate complaints and fail to deliver basic everyday necessities? Are the transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental issue?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement and interaction of individual drivers and vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it cannot predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, because drivers generally behave in a relatively consistent manner, traffic flow tends to be relatively stable and can be approximately expressed using mathematical methods.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three fundamental parameters: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) frequency.
These relationships are helpful in the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
The first animals to take to the air were insects. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily conquer enemies, find food, and reproduce more effectively.
Most insects have the advantageous ability to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This creates a wide range of small spaces for them to hide from predators.
The only insect that cannot fold its wings back in modern times is the dragonfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people considered it correct, but many believed the opposite: the idea that the Sun (and other stars), including the solar system, revolved around the Earth.
It's possible because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, reaching up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the fresh water that flows from the world's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. This river collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Building pyramids of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but they never surpassed the pyramids of Giza in size or perfection of construction technique.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt boasted monuments of preceding kingdoms that were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian as its language for legislation and official communication.
Italian is the everyday language used by most people working in the province, while Latin is mainly used for religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and ancient copper because they occur naturally and are relatively easy to extract using crude tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is made up of one of four elements, or a mixture of multiple elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
Although he also proposed a theory that these transform into new substances to create the things we observe, it was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): basic solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, metals like silver and gold also exist.
Also, you can obtain alloys that contain small amounts of non-metal elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when the pencil came into existence, it had become a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the status and use of pencils have decreased as new writing methods have emerged.
Now that people write messages on computer screens, pointers never need to approach again.
I just wonder what will happen to the computer keyboard when new things come out.
An atomic bomb works on the principle of using a large number of protons and neutrons to fuse atomic nuclei, releasing energy.
It's like rolling a heavy load uphill. Splitting the atom releases some of that energy afterwards.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no provocation.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the lunar surface.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
This is thin in low-lying areas, but thicker in mountainous areas.
The ice crust is thin, so there may be more spots on the nearby area. It was easier for lava to come to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates people at work and what captures their attention.
These theories posit that from adulthood onwards, there exist specific desires and/or needs that are formed and established within a person.
These theories are about specific people who want to do what they do, and about what things in their environment make them do or not do specific things.
There are two common themes in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, managers tend to exhibit two behaviors when they start leading their peers. One case is trying to remain "one of the boys (or girls)."
This type of manager often struggles with making unfamiliar decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
According to another version of the spectrum, a person becomes unrecognizable, someone who changes everything the team is doing and makes it their own.
Ultimately, the team's success or failure is the leader's responsibility.
This behavior creates a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same high standards as traditional teams, but with slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact for their real-world groups with whom they interact directly.
They tend to be more independent than traditional team members, as their teams meet across different time zones, something local management may not understand.
The real “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) constitutes a unique component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" within a management team is the team that each member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would any organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One goal of implementing the concept of organizational learning in practice is new discovery.
Creativity and inventiveness become evident when all available resources are used effectively throughout the organization's operations department.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to innovative processes that meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help an organization reach a high level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides empirical evidence for theoretical approaches to studying cognition. Therefore, it refines and clarifies the area of research.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is supported by scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, mental disorders, trauma, and cancer can cause changes in some mental functions and affect behavior.
The advent of new technologies allows us to visualize and study the structure and processes of the brain in ways never before possible.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and the coordination of intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves automating machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose user issues and answer questions, the ability to extract handwriting, and voice and facial recognition.
Those things become separate principles focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems, once used in home computers and video game software applications, are now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Teachers often enjoy taking their students to places they couldn't otherwise go, often choosing to travel by bus.
Technology offers solutions for virtual production practices. Students can view museum depictions, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Exploring the countryside together virtually is a great way to understand future class trips and share experiences with classmates.
For example, every year, students from Bennett College in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, redesign the website every year, and archive the old version online as a draft.
Blogs help students improve their writing skills. Students' blogging experience often starts with grammatical and spelling errors, which readers generally correct.
Because students are the most critical audience, bloggers strive to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "requires students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to appeal to an audience motivates students to be insightful and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Using blogs properly "supports students in becoming more analytical and critical by actively responding to internet material; students can define their own position within the circle of others' writings, and learn to define their position on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city, distinguished by its art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south-east of there lies Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the Muskoka region and beyond it, a pristine natural area untouched by humans.
Foreigners often see these things about Ontario, and other defining characteristics, as being uniquely Canadian.
The large areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some places remain in their untouched wilderness, with almost no inhabitants.
The population comparison stating that there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens might surprise many people.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, far from the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island continent with unique wildlife.
Most of the small islands are either independent nations or associated with France, and are known for their luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the area, greatly influencing the Comoros and Mayotte routes.
Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
To the north, this region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler, regardless of their actual marital status, say they are married.
Also, wearing a ring is helpful (just not an excessively expensive one).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to perceived harassment, and things like following or grabbing their hand are not uncommon.
When disagreeing with men, be confident and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, "okay" doesn't always mean "yes"!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Beida, and Spanish traders, who built their meeting bases there, gave the city the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods geared towards tourists, including tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide array of charming trinkets.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located near the eastern side of Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying the streets of much of the city, especially the city center, under ground.
While Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma requires understanding and studying the conflict situation prevailing in North Kivu province.
This city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along the cheapest route to the Gorilla Mountains in Africa.
To get around the Goma area, you can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). The typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for short distances.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for a strange, faraway place.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor and underdeveloped city, but its reputation continues to attract tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to the danger of desert sand, the site was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
This was one of the key stops during the PBS special, "Africa's Great Civilizations," with Henry Louis Gates.
This city is markedly different from the rest of the country's cities because it has a distinctive Arabic style rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting distinct wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most beautiful of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation fees and entrance fees to the park.
Purchasing a Wild Card, which provides access to South African gardens or all South African National Parks, can be beneficial for anyone.
Hong Kong Island gave its name to Hong Kong and is a major destination for many tourists.
The glittering reflections of Hong Kong's skyscrapers in the waters of Victoria Harbour are likened to a spectacle.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon district on the opposite side.
The main part of Hong Kong Island's urban development is a dense cluster along the northern coast on reclaimed land.
This is a land that British colonizers claimed as their own, and if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to visit.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from Bangladesh to the inland coast of India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
Although some remnants remain of the vast jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain, this woodland is more than just a forest fringe.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is covered by water/swamp.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is now estimated to have 400 Bengal tigers and over 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses run throughout the day within the district, stopping at bus stands (across the main road), but most leave eastwards for Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are usually full, so it's recommended to buy your tickets a few days in advance.
In most districts, comfortable and robust Japanese coastal-area buses operate.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, and they are 378 meters long and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
This bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, coinciding with the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoint construction.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the ancestral territory of various indigenous groups, including the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, or as it was previously known, the "Great Province of the Indians," came into being as a result of Spanish conquistadors clashing with local indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its native identity and unique character.
Argentina is well-known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las Canitas.
Smaller competitions can also be seen here during other times of the year.
For information about the tournament and where to get polo match tickets, please visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
After crossing from the FIC West store, you can exchange your money at the only bank on the island located in Stanley.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also widely accepted.
While British and U.S. currencies may be accepted on remote islands, credit cards may not be. Determine and verify in advance what payment methods are accepted.
As it is nearly impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is in the southern part of Ecuador, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer here, and when it is summer there, it is winter here.
Montevideo is a tropical region, and in the summer months, it is common for the air temperature to reach +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively chilling: the temperature might be below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There isn't a distinct "rainy" or "dry" season: rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild is undeniably wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
As per the park's management, keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they appear, they can attack almost any large animal, including deer, moose, elk, and bears.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. Give these animals their space, as they can be large, wild, and dangerous.
In addition to that, be aware that the smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid taking or preparing fragrant food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This shore was the site of a famous maritime standoff in 1889 when it resisted the departure of seven ships that had come from Germany, the United States, and Britain.
With the exception of one British cruiser, all ships sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland is situated between two harbors, resulting in many beaches. The most famous ones are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and most have pohutukawa trees providing shade.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitematā Harbour, Mission Bay, and the upscale suburb of St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Those are sunny beaches filled with families, with good shops lining the shore. It is safe to swim there.
The main local beer is "Number One," which isn't a sophisticated brew but is pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
While France has many wines, it's better to take New Zealand and Australian wines on a long trip.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're hesitant.
For Australians, "weak, white" coffee is a thing of the past. A "short black" is an espresso, a cappuccino is served with cream (not foamed), and tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate is made to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive, but exceptionally delicious.
Underwater rock diving trips are conducted multiple times throughout the year, and injuries due to underwater rocks are rare.
Even so, take advice from the management, follow all signals and execute them accordingly, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near coastlines and river waters from October to April. At other times, they are rarely found.
Although sharks exist, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind knowing they'll have a place to sleep and rest when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as places to pitch your tent, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combinations of flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or purchase other travel documents (e.g., visa) for your destination.
Any additional changes or requests should be coordinated with the travel agent first, and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to stay at the location, and most participants consider it a necessity.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to secure accommodation near the music.
Even though the music has finished on the main stage, there might be areas at the festival where music continues to play until midnight.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of your cabin, as walking on the ice can produce very dangerous noises.
A boat trip in St. Petersburg includes time spent in the city. The boat trip also exempts passengers from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. There are often no windows or clocks, and exit doors can be difficult to find.
They usually take special orders for food, drinks, and entertainment, making guests feel good and giving them the feeling of wanting to stay there.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages. However, most good players know the importance of staying sober, as intoxication impairs the ability to think clearly.
Anyone driving through high altitude areas or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
You can't drive the same way on ice and snow-covered roads as you would on dry pavement due to low friction.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short amount of time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited due to phenomena such as snowfall, blizzards, vehicle windows frosting over, and ice accumulation.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic usually continues year-round without any hindrance.
Safaris are a great thing that attracts tourism to Africa, and many travelers are drawn to them.
The word "safari" generally refers to traveling to see the magnificent wildlife of Africa, especially the tropical savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and can be observed well with standard equipment.
Lions, lynxes, and snow leopards are sometimes shy, and you will have a better chance of seeing them through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walking", "safari walking" or "going on foot") consists of hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be organized in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having previously hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for your 2020 trip before the extension was announced, you're in a difficult situation.
Even though the cancellation procedures are different, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies from late March will not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to take place.
Most event tickets are estimated to be between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Damp clothes are dried by ironing. Although not available in the room in many hotels, an iron and ironing board can be requested.
If you don't have an iron and you don't like wearing unironed socks, try using a hairdryer if possible.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (or it will shrink and get scorched badly).
There are many different methods for purifying water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some places, boiling water takes only a minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
The filter is distinguished by its efficiency, and if you have any concerns, consider buying bottled water sealed by a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests and insects that are unfamiliar in their home countries.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, and transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from excise and other taxes at specific locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco, can save a significant amount of money.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult section of driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, constantly running through desolate, dense forest.
If you haven't learned to drive on rural roads, remember that steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limit is noticeably lower than the preceding and following sections, often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it is especially important to adhere to this speed.
But surprisingly, the cell service here is much stronger than in many other areas along the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich, varied, and similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Throughout the year, apple pies are a popular pastry, and in the summer, cherries and plums are added to pies.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often well paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to eat a small but rich pastry, try a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, usually eaten with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be "dry" or "liquid."
In Northern India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is widely used in curries; in Southern India and the coastal regions of the peninsula, coconut milk is widely used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a catch-all term that represents the wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without a specific qualifier, the term refers to food originating from the eastern and central parts of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine consists of simply flavored foods, with ground peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and a variety of fragrant spices being the preferred flavors in Java.
Stirrups provide support for the rider's feet and hang on either side of the saddle.
While they provide a great deal of stability for the rider, stirrups also pose a safety risk as the rider's foot can get caught in them.
If a person riding a horse falls off and their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, they are likely to be dragged by the horse. Several safety precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
Initially, most riders wear special boots with heels, solid and rather narrow soles.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety catch consisting of a leather part that breaks away in the event of a rider falling backwards to prevent them from being dragged by the saddle.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's climbing heartland, known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts diverse granite big walls and crack systems.

Skiing and snowboarding, which include mountain downhill snow sports, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a key activity for travel, as many enthusiasts, sometimes called "snow nomads," plan entire vacations to ski in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old; cave paintings depicting people skiing date back to 5,000 BC.
Skiing downhill dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Snowshoeing: This activity is also known as snowshoe touring, snowshoe hiking, or snowshoe trekking.
Although it doesn't usually include Alpine skiing or mountaineering, this is related, and doing the following things on steep terrain required more rigid skis and boots.
Think of sledding routes as being similar to hiking trails.
In good conditions, you can cover significantly more distance than walking, but the speed at which you can traverse the entire area on skis is achievable if you are on a groomed trail without a backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, international travel means applying for visas multiple times and going through passport control several times.
However, the Schengen area functions to some extent like a single country in this regard.
Within this zone, you can cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what constitutes an antique manufactured item. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition has geographic variations, as places like North America may have a lower age limit than Europe.
Handmade products, even if newer than similar mass-produced goods, can be defined as antiques in terms of longevity.
Reindeer husbandry is an important part of the Sami people's livelihood, and their trading culture is also important to many people with other professions.

Searches at security checkpoints have become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
It is not necessary to assume that transgender people will have their privacy and dignity strictly protected by the screening and admission area before surgery.
A rip current is an explosive flow usually caused when underwater rocks or similar obstructions are hit and broken, and then the flow rushes back from the shoreline.
According to underwater topography, return flow concentrates in deeper areas, creating a rapid current towards the deep water.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back won't be more difficult than swimming normally.
Depending on your skills, try aiming for a place that cannot be rebuilt, whether you are noticed or not, you may want to wait to be saved.

For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, sometimes it can be very difficult to readjust to their native culture.
After living abroad, when you return to your homeland, you may have adapted to a new culture and lost some aspects of your own native culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people probably knew you were traveling in a new country and understood that travelers need to adapt to a new country, so they were patient.
People might not fully anticipate that patience and understanding become essential for travelers returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for kids in this place.

In remote locations where there is no mobile network coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for mobile phones because the satellite antenna needs to be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite to make calls, so it needs to be in line of sight.
This service is frequently used in freight forwarding, including for recreational boats and long-range data expeditions where voice communication is required.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, the most common options are traveling and studying.
This is especially common among those who have finished school, and it offers the opportunity to take a year off before entering university without interrupting their education.

Enrolling in this educational program requires paying tuition.
Finland is a country where you can travel by admiring boats. It's known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" and also has thousands of islands, both in its lakes and as an archipelago.
You don't necessarily need a sailboat in archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are big enough for any sailboat, even a small boat or kayak offers a different impression.
Boating is a Finnish summer pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It has been compared to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it has its own unique characteristics (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you will visit the historical city for several full days and then sleep and rest on a boat overnight on the way back.
You will not need a separate visa if you are only going on a coastal tour (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Germany and Berlin in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages, especially if they have never flown before or have been exposed to shocking events.

Delivery companies deliver anything quickly and efficiently for a good fee. Time is often of the essence for business documents, goods, or urgent repair parts.
Some routes are operated by large companies with their own aircraft, while other routes and smaller firms had no problems.
If they had sent their goods by air freight, customs and loading could take several days on some routes.
The fastest way to send it was as checked baggage. Airlines don't ship unaccompanied baggage, which means you have to travel with it yourself.
One definite way to fly first class or business class is to spend a thick wad of cash to get priority (or, even better, there's a good way to have your company do it).
However, this doesn't come cheap: according to the rule of thumb, you'll have to pay four times as much for a business class seat as for a regular economy seat, and eleven times as much for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no need to even check for discounts on business and first-class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there's a specific core group of people who are willing to pay top dollar for an equivalent experience to get to a place quickly and comfortably.
