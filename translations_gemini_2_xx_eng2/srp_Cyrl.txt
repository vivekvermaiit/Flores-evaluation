Although one experimental vaccine appears effective in reducing mortality from Ebola, so far no drug has proven adequate enough to treat an existing infection.
The antibody cocktail called ZMapp initially showed promise, but official studies revealed that it was not as effective in preventing Ebola mortality as expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments against it.
USA Gymnastics supports the US Olympic Committee's letter and embraces the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that it would be in the best interest of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, to continue with significant changes within our organization, rather than face decertification.

Besides confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, this also gives us details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis likely arose later in evolutionary development compared to these other characteristics.
The feather structure indicates that they were not used for flying, but for temperature regulation and display. The researchers' opinion is that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample suggests that it is the plumage of an adult individual, not a juvenile.
Researchers stated that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult individual and not the down of a chick.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty people.
The governor's office announced that nineteen police officers were among the injured.
The police stated they suspect a purported ISIS fighter is responsible for the attack.
They concluded that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: it was established that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their light and rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in the domain of its magnetic reversal.

The work done is mainly theoretical in nature, but the program is written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was searching for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
In the same principle that the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just like ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, the largest part of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo, and is made up of numerous tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal area of South Africa.
He said in the interview that the new strain is "extremely problematic and disturbing due to the high mortality rate."
Doctor Mole thinks that some patients may have been infected in the hospital, and at least two were hospital healthcare workers.
In the course of one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.

Infrared images showing temperature differences between day and night indicate that these are most likely caves.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface, while at night they are warmer.
"Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it's clear why that is given that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Science Center and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally very simple in terms of technology: voters seclude themselves in a booth and place a printed ballot with the selected candidate marked into an envelope.
Once the officials confirm the voter's identity, they insert the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter register.
The French electoral law very strictly codifies protocol.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except those from properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend any part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Four female skiers in the sitting category failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to make the race ranking list.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants were named Baba Kandžar, Buta Kandžar, Rampro Kandžar, Gaza Kandžar, and Vishnu Kandžar.
Police Inspector Chanda Shekar Solanki stated that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja has since been charged at Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised given that her picture has been published in many media outlets.
This is common practice in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted: "It seems that journalists are walking a dangerous line if they publish images of suspects or something else."
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, which is Scotland's prosecution service, told reporters that there would be no further comment at least until charges are brought.
According to leaked information, the document will concern the discussion about borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian authorities agree to that presence for only five years.
Marksmen involved in the supplementary pest control operation were supposed to be under the strict supervision of rangers, considering that the operation was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Thanks to a partnership between NPWS and a corporation called the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers have been engaged within the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park and heritage protection at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
The new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) was sworn in yesterday under Martelly.
That is Martelly's fifth electoral commission in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests are caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating defective iPod devices have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires, as well as minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices in question.
Last week, Meta announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "insignificant."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report delay "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM on Friday, GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no tsunami threat.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, but at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly lady as she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to build a career in the field of medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that the application of hormones would accelerate fetal lung maturation in babies.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two "black boxes" containing flight data recorders.
Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. Pretty unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as weird as I am...maybe even more...I love her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but doubts have been raised about his fitness due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed for pain because it was banned at the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several individuals confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water that reached Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and enable life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets have been colliding with Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, became governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said the rumors were "political babble and nonsense."
The rumor is that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to earlier technologies based on ground-based radars, so that air traffic controllers can determine a more precise position of the aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate data.
No extra transport put on overground trains will stop at Wembley, and park-and-ride facilities are not available above ground.
Fear of a lack of transportation has raised the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal "Science" reports on the creation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be processed into a thin wire, which can be twisted or braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made in a very thin form, as well as glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical is.
pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (given that hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix those two dry powders together and then, with clean, damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilet bowls in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in the same company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a signal and then sends it back down almost instantaneously.
The rocket sent a satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
Sending satellites or telescopes into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet tall.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us is that it enabled much easier and faster transportation.
That brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are mid-sized cats that eat mid-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a specific job each cat performs that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats and live in large groups known as prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and their young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions in behavior (but not to other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, a tiger can climb trees (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same genus (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's loud roar, but rather more like a sentence full of growling, exclaimed words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and if they can, birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and search for animals to eat (prey) by scent, by smelling the place on the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with the help of night vision, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different rivals, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger rival than was previously necessary.
The original population has not changed at all, so they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe in and take in the carbon dioxide that people breathe out (that is, exhale).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide us with shade.
We make houses from plants, and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, and they feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with over 70 teeth, as sharp as razors, along with an additional set of teeth on the hard palate, meaning that nothing that crossed his path could escape.
We cannot say for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a huge dinosaur like a T-Rex would be no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual things to feast on, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor men and women would eat their food sitting on chairs, the rich liked to organize banquets where they would recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not contain foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's house.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to appease the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in front and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
In the past, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The majority of daily life for a Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just open stalls overlooking the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not correct. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.

Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that somewhere near the beginning of its creation, this large document on parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Well, the tag was most likely added purely as a marker.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
She was led by "Vichy" French. These were Frenchmen who reconciled with the Germans in 1940 and allied themselves with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, an invasion called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated the south of France and began moving towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in cooperation, i.e., a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word "civilis," which means civic or relating to citizens, and is connected to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, which also somehow defines the size of the community.
City-states are the precursors to nations. Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and are therefore often not recognized as true civilizations.
While the War of Independence was being waged, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all its legal documents.
He also had no right to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
Unanimous approval from all states was necessary before members could be changed, and the states took the central administration so lightly that their representatives were often absent from meetings.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, was the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical representations.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of this island as "Ilha Formosa," or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and in 1885, they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire.
Following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, by which Japan gained sovereignty over Taiwan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio was inherited by the image sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is considered to be 3:2 (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or nearly approximate this ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and mocked, is simply a guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in the image.
It states that the most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be subjected to oversight.
The Christian religion has connected European countries for thousands of years, despite differences in language and customs.
With her inexhaustible power, she influenced everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for that reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off the flow of key military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, thereby endangering even neutral ships.
As responses to this tactic had been limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and war atrocities during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
To accept a job at the New York-based Edison Company, Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each period of China or each family that was in power represented a specific dynasty.
There were also unstable periods of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous period of all was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted sixty years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce fighting occurred between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the throne in the enormous palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, professions were open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the military, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that were beyond his ordinary life. He would often go to contemplate in the cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light).
The cave itself, having survived various eras, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's hard to find, even if someone knows it exists. After entering the cave, complete isolation ensues.
Nothing more can be seen except for the clear, beautiful sky and numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramidal structures that pay homage to the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upbow" marking looks like a V, and the "downbow" marking looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
"Up" means you should start from the tip and push the bow, while "down" means you start from the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Raising the bow usually produces a quieter sound, while lowering the bow produces a louder and more assertive one.
Feel free to pencil in your own markings, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to withdraw from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats directed at the king and queen.
The mob ordered the King and Queen to throw open the carriage windows.
At one point, a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the citizens of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to cover most of the costs and interest on securities that circulated in Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the enormous profit stemming from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people represented the fundamental gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, which is a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which officially ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development follows a path of its own, independent of cultural and political influences, and that technology, in turn, has its own "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Nevertheless, a national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher frequency of road accidents, which in turn leads to the discovery of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and a culture would emerge tied to that geography, and these, in accordance with the society's location, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until around the year 1100.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned, bringing gifts, such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was precisely at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could be lagging behind by some 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest inventions of that era, resulting from the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food only for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds, indigenous to a given ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class affiliation, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often signify their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, which include fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at some sad cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children occurs because parents refuse to accept the child's serious intellectual and physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse in childhood or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are claimed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When completely raised by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely resembling that of the animals that cared for them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, learning through scaffolding goes a step further.
Metacognitive scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals, helping them navigate a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is essentially a type of support, but so is the little paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are an integral part of the software and should review, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to carry out on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it still happens.
We consider the foster care system a protective zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, continuous education, and reliable healthcare.
Family foster care should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes from which the children were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of usage and access to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important purposes for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998), in their research on audience reactions to websites, identified "personal involvement" and "maintained relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that, if you accurately interpret microexpressions, you can detect whether someone is lying.
In his work "President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even believes that animals like domestic dogs might also possess such abilities in understanding human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unhidden.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination influence the constant mixing of variations between two gene pools in each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a human-like digestive tract struggles to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
Even if this is not done, serious consequences can occur: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest accessible plant resources were proteins available in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting them unless they are cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
When everything is taken into account, it shouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleeping period and going back to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved with a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you to a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you reset your alarm clock while you are asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only things standing in the way of this goal are our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they have been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing different deities, energetic channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to these two countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was planned to last 40 years, and the struggle would be real, through conflicts in smaller countries representing the interests of larger military powers, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transoceanic shipping is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across the ocean.
The job of a navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while also preventing the enemy from transporting their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and armaments across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as it conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easier access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by goatherds who were mainly children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still in use today.
Railways for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling wagons to achieve greater speeds and haul larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Railway sleepers were introduced quite early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
This has become an established practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the carts.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, rails made of solid iron were used for the first time.
The first known form of transportation was walking. Humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, australopithecines, did not walk as upright as is commonly believed.
Perfection in bipedalism has been found in australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and extinguish it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent several blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
John Nixon was the first to publicly read this document, on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th and read to his troops on July 9th in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original, handwritten version has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still seem like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on handling information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
It may not be immediately obvious that it is internal poisoning. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of open packages of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term beetle in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects very well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and common bed bugs are species that stay with their parents for a long time, and are adapted to living in the nest or host's home.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to experience MS symptoms as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples may decide to plan for adopting a baby.
During adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main task of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. This method actually governs most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only method, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also drive scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's conceptions of all scientific questions, including psychology, were respected.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many notable rhythms in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms that are not just responses to the periodic alternation of external influences have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a free-running period of oscillation, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material that is affected, and whether the cells affected are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna of the wilderness.
Field activities include, for example, hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural villages by car to get to their workplaces, passing those whose workplace is precisely in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation process, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this high-carbon consumption economy has shifted the biosphere away from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints and why do they make mistakes every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid enemies and more efficiently find food and partners.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against their body.
This gives them a wider choice of different small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This sounds reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its width occasionally reaching six miles.
A full twenty percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids at Giza in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old by then.
The Vatican has about 800 residents. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also a common language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, considering that they can be found in nature in their native form and can be relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, had a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of only one or a few of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances in order to form what we see.
Alloys are actually mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that consist of a small amount of nonmetals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pen was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and used less.
People now write messages on a computer screen without ever having been near a quill.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will turn into when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle of taking energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's roughly like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Re-splitting the nucleus then releases a certain amount of energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
The thinner one is under the lunar sea, and the thicker one is under the hills.
Perhaps there are more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what motivates people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they matured into adults.
These theories study what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the one responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Such behavior often results in a gap between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams need to meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones, which local management might not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is a management team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing organizational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can come to the fore.
As a result, the organizational process in which people work together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that will satisfy customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching cognitive abilities, thereby narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' claims in their research.
It has been known for quite some time that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and material for creating simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI strongly evokes science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence encompasses creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and for military purposes, given that they are embedded in several home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places where traveling by bus isn't an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Virtually sharing experiences from the field trip is also an excellent way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School from North Carolina design a webpage about their trip to the state capital, every year the webpage is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critically inclined audience, the blog writer is starting to make an effort to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more resourceful regarding the world around them." The need to encourage audience interest inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to online materials, students can define their own positions in the context of others' texts, as well as present their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, and boasts a wealth of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven of unspoiled natural beauty in Muskoka and beyond.
All of this further highlights Ontario as something that foreigners essentially consider to be quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, just off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island, and also a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely adopted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, from when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was also used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and even the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Baida, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it is all intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
Goma was destroyed in 2002 by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside of Goma should be carefully examined to understand the state of the fighting that is still ongoing in the North Kivu province.
This city is also the base from which ascents to the Nyiragongo volcano begin, along with offering some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation ranks it among tourist attractions, and it even has an airport.
Due to the threat of desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
That was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stops while filming "Africa's Great Civilizations" on PBS.
This city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship attraction of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entry fees.
It is also worth considering purchasing a Wild Card, which allows entry into specific South African parks or all national parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The skyline of Hong Kong, a series of buildings, is likened to a glittering bar graph made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To best experience Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban area is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This place was taken as their own by British colonizers, so if you're looking for proof of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world and stretches 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans spans an area of 3850 km², of which one-third is covered by water/wetland areas.

Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a fast and convenient way to reach nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge across the Oyapock River that connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide each.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge was planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the completion of customs checkpoints on the Brazilian side was expected.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "Giant Province of the Indies," was founded in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous native groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
You can also see smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
For all news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association (Asociacion Argentina de Polo).
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at parity with the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British currency and United States currency may be; check with owners in advance to determine which method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; temperatures above 30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity in combination make it feel much colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
Regardless of their tame appearance, bison, moose (both North American and European), bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Besides that, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking strongly scented food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has officially held the title of capital of Samoa since 1959.
Luka was the site of a notorious naval conflict in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships, except for one British cruiser, were sunk. Nearly two hundred American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Given that Auckland sprawls across two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas:
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most of them have shade provided by pouhutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitematā Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches which are sometimes crowded, and with a rich array of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer "Broj Jedan" (Number One) isn't a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that are good to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines might withstand the journey better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the coffee "white double espresso with milk" is a foreign concept. Short black is "espresso", cappuccino comes highly topped with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but exceptional.
Throughout the year, numerous trips to the reef are organized, and injuries caused by any of the aforementioned reasons on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the authorities' advice, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the city of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of this timeframe.
There are sharks, however they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away from you as far as possible.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation through them, such as campsites.
Travel agents commonly offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even flight and hotel combinations.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer, or they can obtain other documents you need for the destination you are visiting (e.g., a visa).
Any amendment or request should be sent to the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to secure a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have stopped, there may be parts of the festival where music is played late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea during winter, check the location of the hut, as passing through the ice causes quite horrible sounds for those who are most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money visitors spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and encourage them to stay on the premises.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served on the house. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning a trip to high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is weak, and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, as well as fog or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic generally flows without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the experience for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to overland journeys where you can see amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars slowly, so standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you'll have a better chance of seeing them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "nature walk," "walking safari," or "walking tour") consists of hiking, which lasts a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies are not valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
The expected price for most event tickets will range from 2,500 to 130,000 Japanese yen, with a typical ticket price being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps damp clothes to dry. Many hotels offer ironing and ironing board rentals, even if you don't have them in your room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are several methods for purifying water, some of which yield better results against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying water from reputable companies in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are generally not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated rural areas.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be prepared to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns dominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the preceding and subsequent sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
It's interesting, however, that the mobile phone network is much stronger here than along many other parts of the road, e.g. in the Pennsylvania Wilds reserve.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and diverse, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices in combination with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Given that it encompasses 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generalized term encompassing a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
However, when used without further qualifiers, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a wide array of simply seasoned dishes, among which the prevailing flavors Javanese people prefer are peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer the rider greater stability but can pose a safety hazard due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse continues to run. Numerous preventative measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to fall off the saddle if pulled by the rider during a fall.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
Breathtaking views stretch from the highest peaks. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among the mountain's vast potential.
Snow mountain sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," plan entire vacations spent skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to as early as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski mountaineering: This activity is also often called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not usually include, ski touring or alpine-style mountaineering; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much sturdier skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as being similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover a somewhat greater distance than by walking – but you will very rarely reach the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa application and passport control multiple times.
In that regard, however, the Schengen area functions similarly to a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply separately for visas for each of the Schengen member states, which saves time, money, and avoids paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured articles are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define products older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be lower in places such as North America compared to Europe.
Handmade items can be defined as antiques, even if they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is important for the life of the Sami people, and culture within trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami were heavily dedicated to reindeer herding, but rather lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and primarily used reindeer for pulling and carrying loads.
Today, many Sami people are engaged in modern crafts. Tourism is a significant source of income in Lapland, a region located in the Lapland region.
Although common, especially outside the Roma community, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it evokes negative stereotypes and false assumptions about Roma people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to travel advisories, this may affect your health or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to hear the advice of governments of other countries in addition to yours, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different scenarios than Europeans or Arabs.
The reports are just brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are different types that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and consequences of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks posed by bad weather in the area they are in, as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who wants to travel to a country that could be called a war zone should undergo professional training beforehand.
If you type "hostile environment course" into an internet search engine, you will probably get the address of a local company.
The course will typically cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
The course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, plenty of first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documentation for their return.
The readiness of governments to issue passports that do not specify a person's gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security checkpoint screenings have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are return flows from waves that break off the beach, often present at reefs or similar locations.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast current to deep water can be created there.
Most fatalities occur due to exhaustion when trying to swim upstream, which can be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their home culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding with you, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adjust.
People may not expect that passengers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things here for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is positioned as a background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Many nations lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and have the most bases there, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau, then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountain Range, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are located the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak, Vinson, reaching 4892 m.
In remote locations, without mobile phone signal coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone because, in order to make a call, you have to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used when traveling by boat, including yachting, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
A increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with those finishing school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can improve prospects for progressing towards higher education in one's country of origin.
There is usually a tuition fee for enrolling in one of these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are similar to this, but otherwise it is very unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit a historic city for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only visit the coast as part of ship excursions, you do not need a special visa (as of 2009).
In brochures, Berlin in Germany is highlighted as part of some cruises. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
That's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes regarding other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight can help them overcome fear that is based on the unknown or the inability to have control over events.
Courier companies are well-paid for the fast delivery of items. Time is often very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes or for smaller companies, it was a problem.
If they sent the goods by air freight, on some routes it's possible that it took days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get through faster was to send the luggage as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to shell out a hefty sum for the privilege (or, even better, get the company you work for to do it for you).
However, this isn't cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than a regular economy ticket for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business and first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there's a certain group of passengers willing to pay extra for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
This conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova in 1994, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very well-connected transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center situated in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass walls, and modern shopping malls are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some tombs.
It's worth setting aside half an hour for a walk through the intriguing village.
To the north and in the immediate vicinity lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron recorded the glorious story of its delights.
The Scotturb bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also, in the north, visit the grand Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple), a place known worldwide for apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please be aware that you are visiting a site of mass graves, as well as a place of almost incalculable significance to a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their stay here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or exploited to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the site by making marks or carving graffiti on objects.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, given that it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also used quite a bit in public transport and in other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced automatically in a large number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, unkind, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave politely - like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make your navigation much easier.
The unfriendly behavior of Parisians quickly evaporates if you show a little basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an exceptionally wide range of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, differing soils, and diverse levels of altitude.
This area is also a habitat for an exceptionally large number of diverse species of animals and birds.
Rare animal species can be found here, including brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats, and capercaillies, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knee and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries have skirts available for women who came unprepared, but if you bring your own skirt, especially one with bright colors, you'll bring a smile to the face of the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same rule, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this from the stock at the entrance, but that clothing is not washed after every wearing, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, it's a universal size!
Mallorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and predominantly uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie," which means "You" (formal), are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between certain verbs and an object.
It can also be said that it makes reading easier, although writing is a bit complicated due to the need to determine whether a verb or adverb is being used in the form of a pronoun.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are "c" and "g", considering their pronunciation varies depending on the following consonant.
Also, make sure you pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means carriage.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that if you speak a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and exist as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution wasn't the problem it is today during their heyday, they can usually be found in cities or on campuses, where they were more easily accessible than those built in the modern era.
Most modern telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossom were organized by the Emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the urge to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "samples" will also get you kicked out, and without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But considering that it is located in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less often).
A couple of buses also go north to Hebron, where the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives is located.
Check if the bus you plan to take goes directly to Hebron itself, and not just to the nearby Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for planning a vacation.
For example, a tour of the Loire Valley castles, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night without sleeping, in some open place in order to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possible that this ritual of spring and fertility originated before the appearance of Christians.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, while communities often begin the celebration as soon as midnight strikes to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not travel, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you are visiting Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience polar nights, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, given that the sky will be dark more or less throughout the whole day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are common in business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees often have to seek approval from their superiors for every decision made, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
