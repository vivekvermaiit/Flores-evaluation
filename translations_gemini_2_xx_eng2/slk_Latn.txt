Not only does it confirm the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, but it also provides details that fossils generally could not, including color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored underneath.
The discovery also provides a detailed insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather features – barbs and barbules – scientists have concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. According to the scientists' claim, even though this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows the feathers of an adult individual and not the down of a hatchling.
Even though it is a young dinosaur's tail, according to scientists the sample contains the feathers of an adult individual and not the down of a hatchling.

The work they carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations about the Sagittarius galaxy.
The phenomenon the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attractive force on the Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way act on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that the effect of one dark matter on another is the same as it is with ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a sort of halo, and is made up of a multitude of small particles.

Infrared images captured temperature changes at night and during the day, thus proving that they are likely caves.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team, who also works at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting was traditionally at a low technological level. Voters went to a separate area and placed a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of their chosen candidate in an envelope.
Once officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law has a relatively strict codification of procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except those cast by duly verified and counted voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the entire process. In the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision in accordance with specific procedures.

The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house at the moment the car crashed, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
While the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT, the road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed.
Initially, he was hospitalized in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Then Adekoya was accused of murdering his son by Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised because her likeness has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in Great Britain, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee argues that "journalists are heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photographs of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for criminal prosecution, indicated to reporters that it would not comment further on the case, at least until charges are brought.
According to leaked information, the document is said to concern the border demarcation dispute demanded by Palestine based on the state of the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly being discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Following the signing of the agreement, Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while Palestine agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
Marksmen in the supplementary test against pests were to be under the strict supervision of foresters, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were accepted under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting park manager for conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly inaugurated the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Martelly's CEP in the last four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the pre-arranged resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been taking place since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods have been reported, which have caused six fires and resulted in minor burns for four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, the government agency METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "minor."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 Greenwich Mean Time).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management has declared that no damage has been reported in the country.
According to a statement from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there is no indication that a tsunami is expected.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Along with the Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and elderly people, were also prematurely released.
Then the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, so-called "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Comrades also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. She was my first manager. She died on a night of two moons, which was quite original, just like her. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented on it with the words: "Luna was just as crazy as me... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's doing well up there."
Of the 1400 people who participated in a survey before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard communicated during the campaign before the 2010 federal election her conviction that Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of respondents think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle at the Commonwealth Games, as well as three relays, but doubts have arisen about his fitness due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication needed to overcome the pain because it is banned at the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Several people had confirmed the invention using other hardware and software by the beginning of February, with this being announced on Tuesday.
Comets were likely a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political blather and foolishness."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows airplanes to fly shorter routes, thus saving millions of liters of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radar, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
There are no other modes of transport available, overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are also no parking facilities or park-and-ride options available.
Concerns about a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
On Thursday, a study was published in the journal Science reporting the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new animal species was able to evolve in just two generations, even though it was believed that this process would take much longer. This was achieved through the crossbreeding of the endemic Darwin's finch Geospiza fortis and the immigrant cactus finch Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a variety of forms. For example, it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be turned and braided. It can be hammered and rolled into sheets.
It is possible to produce it very thinly and it can be glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handmade images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) a chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, form them into a ball.
The moisture from your hands will start to react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange sensation and the formation of a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house.
Remnants of a sewage system were found in the houses of Greek Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets were also present in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were together in mixed company.
You use a satellite to speak to someone who is thousands of kilometers away.
A satellite located in space receives a call, which it then reflects back down to Earth almost immediately.
A rocket carried the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
To get a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket, taller than 30 meters.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most significant thing the wheel brought us is much simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to that, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that prey on medium-sized game – from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a "niche," that is, specific areas or tasks that each predator is responsible for, which prevents mutual competition.
Lions are the most social of the cat family, living in large groups called prides.
A pack consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, as they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other felines). They are also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger, like a well-trained athlete, can climb (even if not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times stronger than a powerful man.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's roar with a mighty voice, but more like a few hoarse, shouted words.
Ocelots have a fondness for eating small animals. Occasionally, they manage to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds. However, the vast majority of animals that ocelots hunt are significantly smaller.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and search for animals that can be eaten (prey) based on scent and by sniffing places where they have been.
They see very well in the dark using night vision and also move very discreetly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (such as when they move across a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island, making it difficult to return), they often find themselves in an environment that differs from their original one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor, compared to what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it will increasingly resemble members of other populations less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
The name of this process is speciation, which simply means the evolution of new species. Speciation is an unconditional result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which people breathe out.
Plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our houses, as well as to make clothing. Most of what we consume is of plant origin. Animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. It also fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked everything that entered the water. Not even a huge dinosaur, like a Tyrannosaurus rex, could match it.
While many of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual foods at banquets, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that poor people and women used to eat sitting on chairs, while wealthy men preferred communal feasts where they consumed food while reclining on their sides.
Ancient Roman dishes certainly could not contain ingredients that only arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the deity.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and ceremonies.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, specially built pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were also part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
The house was not as essential in the warm climate of the Middle East.
An ordinary Hebrew family spent most of their life outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, and the shops consisted only of counters open to the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas relate that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he sailed further west, he found a new land and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Even though Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are "Scandinavian" countries, there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days it was a large parchment document (measuring 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the record served only to identify the document.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
He was ruled by "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means civic, and this word is related to the Latin word "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, which also defines the size of a society in a certain way.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture brings with it the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, the continuation of a cultural footprint, and even distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolution, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, whose only component was Congress.
Congress had no power to levy taxes. And since there was no national executive or judiciary, Congress relied on state authorities to enforce all its laws. However, they often did not cooperate.
It also had no authority to rewrite tax and tariff laws between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team, along with the national football team from Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and they were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international and Olympic events.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, from a geographical perspective, Japan is often considered an "archipelago."
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors sailing around recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, begins transforming the cultivation practices of native grains, and employs Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) gained control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the edge of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1975, and restoration continues to the present day.
For example, the most common photograph format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sensors of digital cameras.
In reality, the 35 mm format is surprisingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format, when divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers, is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS group of formats) are equal to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
A very commonly used, but also ridiculed, technique is the simple rule of thirds, which creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in the image.
He claims that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a millennium, Christianity has united European countries despite differences in languages and customs.
His ubiquitous power influenced everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should serve precisely these purposes.
The Church, as a central authority in Rome, had been present for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether its principles were being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it managed to disrupt vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, creating a danger even for neutral vessels.
Since there was only a minimal reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After the world witnessed the horrors and atrocities committed during the First World War, nations longed to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from his previous manager, Charles Batchelor, recommending him to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each historical period of China, or each family in power, was a dynasty that left a significant mark on history.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which existed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a brutal war raged between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, and thousands of people died fighting for the highest position in the grand palace of Xi'an.
Many social and political phenomena are noticeable, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, jobs were available to all male applicants, thus allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same goes for the army, because instead of army ranks being based on class, they switched to caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters transcending earthly life. He often went to meditate in a cave, which became known as Hira, on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Lying on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to get to it at all, even if you know where it is. Once you find yourself in the cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing but a clear, beautiful sky and a multitude of surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many vast pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," is located in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead. Several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx can be seen here.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops), and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and members of his family.
The "bow up" symbol looks like a V, and the "bow down" symbol looks like a hairpin or a square missing its bottom side.
Up bow means you should start at the tip and push on the string, while down bow means you should start at the frog (the part of the bow you hold) and pull the bow.
The upper part of the bow usually creates a finer sound, while the lower part of the bow is stronger and more durable.
You can feel free to write down your own tracks, but remember that the printed notes are there for musical reasons, so you should usually preserve them.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women drove the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, from Versailles back to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, accompanied by an angry mob of shouting people who were threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the windows of the carriage wide open.
In a moment, someone from the crowd waved the head of the royal guard, which had been beheaded in Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of the American imperialism's war during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to cover the majority of expenses, and interest from bonds in the name of the Philippine government was channeled through banking houses on Wall Street.
It is clear that the enormous profits acquired through the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order arose.
The period when those events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an epoch of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is generally dated to around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that, in practice, encompasses a wide range of concepts, from the development of new technologies or technological imperative to its narrow meaning that human destiny is governed by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology "influences" societies in ways that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that motor vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
A nationwide road network solely for a few cars is not economically sustainable, therefore new production methods are being developed with the aim of reducing the costs associated with car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to heal injured bodies.
An important element of Romanticism was cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture arose in connection with geography, which were in harmony with society and were better than arbitrarily established laws.
Just as Paris is currently considered the capital of fashion, Constantinople was in the era of feudal Europe.
His fame as an epicenter of luxury began sometime around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century. The main reason is that the crusaders returned and brought gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what was offered in Byzantine markets.
It was precisely at that time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. Among the greatest achievements of that era, brought about by the Crusades, were buttons. They began to be used for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is practiced for the purpose of producing only enough food necessary to sustain the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses its own saved seeds – originating from the ecoregion – in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, social class, geographic location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization draws on several unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unfortunate, or intentionally abused and were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "untamed" or wild. Some untamed children were restrained by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents abandoned the child because they couldn't cope with its severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived independently in the wild.
When a feral child is raised only by non-human animals, their behavior (within physical limits) is almost the same as the behavior of that particular animal, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should facilitate learning and make it more interesting, a strategy called "scaffolding" goes a step further.
Scaffolding isn't a teaching method, but rather a support that helps people who encounter new experiences while learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
"Scaffolding" can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is also a form of "scaffolding," but so is a paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software. They are primarily designed to challenge and explain overly complex procedures to the student, which they would not be able to manage on their own.
Children are placed in alternative care for various reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet it still happens.
We perceive it as the foster care system being a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide children with everything they need that was missing in the household from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to further possibilities in the context of uses and gratifications theory.
For example, there is an assumption that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
In researching audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as motivating aspects.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
More precisely, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, one can determine whether a person is lying.
In his work "President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can accurately assess the sincerity of a speech.
It even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may also be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix variations between these two groups with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
If you do not do so, it will have serious consequences: weakened growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources were likely the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, it shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is a process that involves deliberately waking up during one's usual sleep time and then falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
You can achieve this easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
However, if you snooze your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, a known diuretic), which will force a person to get up and urinate.
The level of inner peace a person possesses is indirectly related to the tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is fundamentally very simple and encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yogic postures, aerobic exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The foundation of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, these allied countries became divided in their views precisely because of the clash of systems, processes, and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last another 40 years, and it was indeed fought through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive wall had already been broken, and the only hope for it was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union violated the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral, and entered the eastern regions of Poland, thus creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and cargo across oceans.
The traditional role of naval forces was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move people and goods. At the same time, however, they were to prevent your enemy from moving people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move troops and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop these transfers mainly by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain, just as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, and were often herded by goatherds, who were frequently children or adolescents, much like the well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed draft horses to achieve higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the roads of the time, which were somewhat rougher.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. However, it was later discovered that the rails would be more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation is walking. Humans began walking upright as early as two million years ago, when Homo Erectus (upright man) evolved.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in australopithecine fossils dating back 4.2 - 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start behaving more considerately towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, in order to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
As in many cases, it's about something like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should get to the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly thanks to humanity's scientific and technological progress, and overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles are only exacerbating the problems.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made in the course of one night. They are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was delivered by John Nixon and took place on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
25 Dunlap broadsides still exist, and they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today hold the view that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds, there are many things that still look like they do in dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The quickest sign to determine internal poisoning is the presence of open packaging of medications or toxic household cleaning chemicals.
Refer to the label for specific first-aid instructions related to this particular poisoning.
Entomologists use the term beetle for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This name comes from the old knowledge of the bedbug, which is an insect highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Mites and bedbugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in a nest or located on their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research indicates that the probability of MS occurring in women is twice as high compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples may decide to create a so-called adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take over the care of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works using scientific methods. These methods, in effect, drive most scientific research.
However, it's not just about experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observations during observation can also help guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific knowledge, including that in the field of psychology, was accepted.
The West gradually became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots as knowledge of Greek declined.
Many observed physiological and behavioral rhythms often critically depend on the presence of internal cycles and their creation through biological clocks.
Regular rhythms are documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and these rhythms are not merely a response to external, repeating signals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that will continue to free-run even in the absence of external environmental cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was among the key evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on their type, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether germ cells are affected.
Mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and animals.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Examples include sightseeing, photography, and getting to know orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns for work, passing by others who work where the first group just left.
In this shuttle transport, everyone is somehow tied to and supports the transport system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive "carbon" economy has displaced the stable state of the biosphere that supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the life of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate a large number of complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the result of observing the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and monitoring their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is challenging because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, and therefore traffic flows also often behave consistently, which can be approximately represented mathematically.
To more clearly represent traffic flow, relationships were defined between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This offers them a wider selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Currently, only one insect group cannot fold its wings, and those are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It discharges more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It accumulates water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom. However, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed, neither in size nor in the technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were captivated by the monuments of their ancestors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world with the lowest population.
Italian is used in the Vatican City for official communication and in legal regulations.
Italian is also used daily by the majority who work in the country, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their native forms and can be extracted relatively easily using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle came up with the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Nevertheless, he believed that they transform into new substances in order to create what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
When the pencil was introduced, it became a good friend to many people.
However, as newer methods of writing emerged, the pencil was sidelined and used less and less.
People now leave messages on computer screens and never have to get near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb utilizes the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with a certain number of protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. When the nucleus is split again, some of this energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei. This means they are prone to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust's thickness is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner underneath Maria and thicker underneath the highlands.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. Lava could more easily reach the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates people to behave in a certain way or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become their own in adulthood.
These theories focus on what motivates people to want to do certain things, and what in their environment compels them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, there are two types of behavior that can occur when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the gang" (or buddies).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary measures, evaluate performance, assign responsibility, and also with responsibility towards people.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual with the feeling that they must change everything the team has done and do it their way.
Ultimately, the manager is responsible for the success or failure of the entire team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual and traditional teams are held to the same quality standards, albeit with slight differences.
Members of a virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet across changing time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
A unique aspect of the virtual team is also the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The Invisible Team" is a management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team also sets the conditions for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals in implementing organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the organization's performing departments, doors open to creativity and ingenuity.
The collaborative process within an organization to overcome an obstacle can subsequently lead to a new, innovative process that helps satisfy customer needs.
An organization can be innovative, but first the leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
The film Angel (2006) explains the Continua approach as a method used to help organizations focused on achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
Correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a large amount of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
AI has a strong science fiction connotation and forms a significant branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of robots.
Research in the field of AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The cases include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These have become independent disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is frequently used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been incorporated into several applications in home computers, or applications within video game software.
Excursions are an important part of every class's life. The teacher would often like to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire magnificent works of art while sitting in the classroom with their classmates.
A great way to think about a trip and share experiences with other classes is to share the excursion virtually.
Each year, for example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is redone annually, but older versions are kept online to serve as a notebook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog author strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
In blogging, "students are forced to focus more on the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest thus inspires students to become more skillful and pursue their interests (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "allows students to deepen their analytical and critical thinking; through active response to online materials, students can define their attitudes in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming "bilingual" capital of Canada, offering visitors a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase its past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka region.
All these things, and others too, highlight Ontario as what foreigners consider to be fundamentally Canadian.
Large areas higher in the north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadians.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have ties with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and on the Comoros and Mayotte, they adopted it in a grand style.
The period of European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female travelers are advised to claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Even wearing a ring is beneficial (but only one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would normally consider harassment. It is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and, under the name Anfa, served as a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it in 1755 after the earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dár al-Bajdá, and Spanish merchants, who established trading posts in the city, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive cities for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the area around the old Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan products are sold, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of geegaws, but it is all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
Even though Goma is reasonably safe, you should do some research before trips outside of Goma to understand the ongoing fighting situation in the Nord-Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
For getting around Goma, you can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu" as a metaphor began to be used to denote relatively inaccessible, exotic, and remote lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction. There is also an airport there.
In 1990, the city was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates's main stops during the PBS special "Africa's Great Civilizations."
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country because its appearance is more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) in northeastern South Africa stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern boundary is formed by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Here too, daily conservation fees and entrance fees are payable, just as in all South African National Parks.
The most beneficial option might be to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a selected number of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The entire Hong Kong area is named after Hong Kong Island and is a major point of interest for many tourists.
The collection of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline could be likened to a glowing bar graph visible from Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the most beautiful view of Hong Kong, you have to leave the island and go across to the Kowloon coastline.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that British colonizers appropriated, and if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarban is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest located in Indian territory is designated as Sundarban National Park.
Forests include not only mangrove swamps, but also some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarban spans an area of 3,850 km², with about one-third being aquatic/marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a kingdom of wilderness, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is recommended to buy your ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to surrounding towns such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the entire Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not put into operation until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is scheduled to start in September 2017, at which point the Brazilian customs control points should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group of people. They resided in the area of present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born from the clash between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has allowed Paraguay to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in the Las Cañitas area.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
You can find information about tournaments and how to purchase tickets for polo matches on the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at parity with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley by credit card, and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, although they might take British and American currency; check with the owners in advance to find out what the acceptable payment method is.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is almost impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are used to the presence of people, wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Regardless of how peaceful they appear, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they need to be given space.
It's also important to remember that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval misunderstanding in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships, except for one British cruiser, were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering of people in the city led to the killing of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Being bordered by two harbors in Auckland allows for the existence of many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches in the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
It's about occasionally crowded beaches for families, with many shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One; it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
Many French wines are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be more accessible.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink. However, if you have concerns, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A small black coffee is an "espresso," a cappuccino is served with a high layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Throughout the year, many excursions take place on the reef, and injuries resulting from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the relevant authorities, obey traffic signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770. They also occasionally occur outside of this period.
Sharks really do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean; their common habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler certainty that upon arrival at their destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with specific hotels. However, they also offer the possibility to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel deals.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need more time to consider the offer or obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g., visas).
Any suggestions for changes or requests should be directed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even if the musical performance ends on the main stages, music may still be playing in some parts of the festival until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are travelling through the northern Baltic region in winter, check the location of your cottage, as travelling on the ice causes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include a city stay. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (but please check the conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to ensure that guests spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible. They mostly lack windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have unique offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests entertained and staying as long as possible.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages. Since intoxication impairs judgment, all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the likelihood of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and therefore you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you could get stuck in it.
Reduced visibility may be caused by falling or blowing snow, condensation on the window, or also by ice forming on the vehicle's window.
Conversely, in many countries ice and snow are common, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest draw for tourism in Africa and a great experience for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to a land journey with the aim of exploring the magnificent African wilderness, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the cars, and the standard equipment allows for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you're better off seeing them from a distance using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, hiking safari, or simply walking) is a hike that lasts several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place at various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having previously hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have found yourself in an unpleasant situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most cancellation policies originating from the coronavirus do not extend into July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the price of a regular ticket being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps to dry damp clothes. Even if they are not in the room, many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't like ironing socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric isn't too hot (this can cause it to shrink, and in extreme cases, burn).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for just one minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying bottled water from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may come into contact with animal pests that are not found in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or violently kill people, are not usually classified as pests.
Shopping in so-called duty-free zones allows you to purchase goods exempt from regular and excise taxes.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it frequently passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on dirt roads, be careful: they are full of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections - typically 56-64 km/h - and strict adherence to them is more important than ever.
Surprisingly, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than on many other sections of the route, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good, and in Bavaria they are also quite varied and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common. Apples are usually baked into pastries year-round, while cherries and plums tend to appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often combined with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but satisfying pastry, try a filled donut, which is called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
We know curry as "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid used.
In inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Thanks to 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
When used without further qualification, the term tends to refer to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, features many simply seasoned dishes. Popular seasonings favored by Javanese people include peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can also pose a safety risk, as the rider's feet can potentially get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse bolts. A number of safety measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a fairly narrow, smooth sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, are equipped with safety bars that allow the stirrup to come loose from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backwards.
The Cochamó Valley is a popular climbing destination in Chile, often referred to as the Yosemite of South America due to its diverse, massive granite walls and overhangs.
The views from the peaks are breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes among the endless potential of the walls.
Popular downhill winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski fanatics," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
With a backpack on skis: This activity is also called backpacking skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski touring.
It is related (but does not usually include) alpine ski touring and mountaineering, which is practiced on steep terrain and requires much tougher skis and boots.
Consider the ski trail to be similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than if you were walking – but you will very rarely reach speeds comparable to cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean that you have to repeatedly apply for visas and go through passport controls.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to some extent as a single country.
If you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen area member countries separately, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes an item an antique. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
The conditions for determination vary across the world, and this age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted items can be classified as antiques even though they are younger than a similar mass-produced product.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and business culture is also important for many other professions.
However, not all Sami were traditionally involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry; they also made a living from fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer mostly as draught animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people are involved in modern crafts. In Sápmi, the Sami area, tourism is an important source of income.
Even though the word "cigán" (gypsy) is very widespread, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are planning to visit is subject to travel advice, this may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
Besides your own government, you may also want to consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The information bulletin only provides a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The opinions presented are often only cursory, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, create serious social disruptions, or lead to loss of life.
Adverse weather and its various forms, which depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions, can occur anywhere in the world.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of adverse weather such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
We strongly advise passengers to consider all the risks that could arise as a result of adverse weather in their area, which could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should participate in professional training.
Just search the internet for "hostile environment course" and you'll likely find the address of some local company.
The course covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, along with practical experiences.
The course length is usually 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid instruction, and sometimes even weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are common, but publications that deal with war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents for the return journey as well.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to reflect a desired name and gender varies.
Similarly varied is the willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents.
In the period after September 11, 2001, security checks at security checkpoints also became much more annoying.
Transgender people pre-surgery should not expect to go through scanners without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Undertows are backwash from waves breaking on the beach, often near a reef or similar.
Thanks to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper sections, where a fast current can form, reaching deep water.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be completely impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to aim somewhere where it won't catch you again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether anyone noticed you, you can try waiting for rescue.
Reverse culture shock sets in faster than culture shock (the initial honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture, it is sometimes particularly challenging to readjust to their original culture.
After returning home from living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adjust in a new country.
People don't have to predict that travelers returning home need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
You can view the pyramids in the dark and quiet before the show starts.
Usually, you can always hear the hustle and bustle of tourists and vendors here. The sound and light show is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is displayed as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Various scenes are depicted on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the highest number of bases, sixteen of which were still active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, there's Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano creates a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area located on the southern part of the peninsula and is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are located the highest mountains of Antarctica. This is the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Mount Vinson, which reaches a height of 4892 m above sea level.
A satellite phone might be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone coverage.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone. To make calls with it, you must be outdoors in a location with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is frequently used in maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as on expeditions that require remote data and voice connectivity.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, traveling and learning remain the most popular choices.
It is especially popular among recent graduates, as it offers them the opportunity of a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, participating in a foreign foundation course can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education in your country.
Tuition fees are usually required for registration in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on archipelagos and lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Rowing is a Finnish national sport, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It's the same for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it's quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands, the number is 1 in 40).
Most Baltic Sea cruises also offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you have a few full days to visit the historical city, while returning to the ship for the night.
If you are only going ashore for an excursion from a cruise ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures include the German city of Berlin. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located by the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience, regardless of the age or origin of the passengers, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear that is based on the unknown or on feeling out of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for fast delivery. Time is often very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies, a problem has arisen.
If the items were shipped by air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take days on some transport routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. However, airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to allocate a large amount of funds for this privilege (or ideally, get your company to do it for you instead).
However, it won't be cheap: you can expect to pay an estimated four times the regular fare for business class and up to eleven times as much for first class!
Generally, it's not even worth looking for discounts on business or first-class tickets for direct flights from point A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of passengers willing to pay a premium for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also very frequently used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna has transformed into a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center that stretches around a huge bay and is surrounded by mountains.
Amidst the wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers, lie houses with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches. The city feels more like Mediterranean Europe than contemporary Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble statues of doves above some of the tombs.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk around the interesting village.
Within easy reach to the north is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, well-known among foreigners and made famous by the brilliant poem about its splendors, written by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 regularly runs to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, it is possible to visit the significant Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (tomb), which is a place of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please keep in mind that you are essentially a visitor to a mass grave and also a place of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who spent some time there during their lives, and far more whose loved ones were murdered there or worked to death, of both Jewish and non-Jewish origin.
Approach the site with the utmost dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the property by writing or scratching graffiti on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the population prefers to communicate in Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs and labels are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
Spanish is not yet commonly used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only announced in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it's often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to not get lost in Paris is still to behave your best and act like someone "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will be significantly easier not to get lost.
The Parisians' austere exterior quickly vanishes if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely covered in forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide range of plant communities due to its array of microclimates, differing soils, and various altitudes.
This area is also home to a wide variety of animals and birds.
Rare fauna occurs here, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering the knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with vibrant colours, a monk or nun might smile at you upon entry.
The same regulations require men to wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the warehouse near the entrance, but be aware that the garment is not washed after each user, so you probably won't feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like others in similar areas of the Mediterranean, relies on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and is indispensable without olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, or other toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns and the formal pronoun "Sie" (You) always begin with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between verbs and objects.
It also demonstrably helps to simplify reading, but writing is slightly more complicated due to the need to distinguish whether a verb or an adjective is used in a nominalized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is quite simple because most words are pronounced the same way they are written.
The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Don't forget that 'r' and 'rr' are pronounced differently: 'caro' means expensive and 'carro' is a cart/carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer could help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It's true that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish, however, may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated today and remain used as museums or places for education.
They are usually located in cities or campuses because they were built during their heyday, when light pollution was not yet a problem. They are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous instruments in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were organized only for the emperor and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even a single specimen.
If you visit a meticulously manicured garden, collecting "samples" will also undoubtedly get you thrown out.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place and it is very easy to get around. You can buy almost anything there after you arrive.
However, if you are located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with heat (constantly) and also strong sun (with clear skies, less frequently).
Several buses also travel north to Hebron, which is the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Verify that the bus you are considering goes to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good idea for a holiday choice.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or a boat trip on the Eijsden Canal.
Moreover, you can find popular hiking and cycling routes in their surroundings.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by non-believers and non-Christians around the world, even in Christian countries.
According to tradition, you stay awake during Easter under the open sky to watch the sunrise.
Of course, Christian theological explanations of this tradition exist, but it could easily be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Mass on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with congregations often celebrating at the stroke of midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands either swam, flew, or floated here.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make this journey. As a result, the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced to the territory, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It will be a good opportunity to observe the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less continuously.
And you will also be able to enjoy the stars, because light pollution is not a problem in sparsely populated areas.
Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what people in the West are used to.
Suits are common work attire, and colleagues address each other by last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key; group effort is emphasized more than individual achievements being praised.
Employees often need to get approval from their superiors before making any decisions and are expected to follow their instructions implicitly.
