While the experimental vaccine appears promising in reducing the death toll from Ebola, to date, no treatment has clearly proven suitable for curing an ongoing infection.
A cocktail antibody, ZMapp, was initially seen as promising in the field, but formal studies have shown that it had little more benefit than what was sought to prevent death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three different treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and embraces the critical need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.

This not only confirmed that some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provided details not possible with fossils in general, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers are chestnut-brown, and on the upper side, there is a pale or carotenoid color on the underside of the flanks.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had feather-like designs—barbs and barbules—researchers estimate that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that, even if this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shown exhibits mature feathers and not those of a chick.
Researchers suggest that even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shown exhibits mature feathers and not down.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning. It killed two police officers and injured more than twenty people.

They found that the Sun behaves according to the simple principles of other stars: the movement of all stars in the system is known to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less magnetically active the star is in relation to magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to replicate observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for can be caused by large waves between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon's struggle to pull the earth causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way it affects regular matter.
This theory suggests that the darkest matter exists around a galaxy in a crown-like structure, and it is made of many small particles.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new strain is "deeply worrying and alarming due to the extremely high death toll."
Dr. Moll suspected that some patients had been infected with an insect in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital health workers.
In one year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any particular time in South Africa.

In France, voting is traditionally a rather old-fashioned experience: voters seclude themselves in a booth, placing a pre-printed paper slip bearing their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the vote roll.
The French electoral law strictly scrutinizes the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those from voters who have properly voted and are allowed to vote.
The candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested the five people who sexually assaulted the Swiss woman and we have recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The accused were named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused attended court with their faces covered.
Even though the car crashed into the house with three people inside, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collapse happened is temporarily closed while emergency services extricate the driver from the red Audi TT.
She was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
She was immediately transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court and is being prosecuted for the murder of his child.
He is in custody while awaiting trial, but any witness evidence could be tainted because his image has been widely publicized.
This is standard practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's justice system is different, and the courts consider publishing photographs potentially prejudicial.
Written by Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous path and it is even more dangerous if they publish images and other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is the overall prosecution authority, indicated to reporters that no further comment would be made until any indictment.
The document, according to the leaker, reportedly discusses border disputes that Palestine wants to recover based on the pre-1967 Mideast War borders.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel is demanding a continued military presence in the valley for ten years if the agreement is signed, while the PA has agreed to only allow the presence for five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control trial are strictly managed by the rangers, who also monitor the trial and assess its effectiveness.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly swore in the nine-member new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended accepting the CEP's prior resignation as part of a series of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission is Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes-violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some dating back to 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in Japan says it is aware of 27 accidents that have occurred involving gadgets.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded to Apple's call for postponement, calling the report "deeply concerning."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office says no damage has been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer kidnapped tourists from Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages were rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Soon, the photographers took the old woman's place because she needed to use the sink. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his free time.
Her research showed that when the hormone is applied, it accelerates the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also gave her an award.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away two months ago. One of a kind. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was weird like me...maybe even more so...I loved her and I miss her...I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 national election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The then Prime Minister Julia Gillard admitted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the polls share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the height of the election, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness is in doubt.
He could no longer take the medication he needed to overcome the pain because it was banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people have confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software since the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
There is a possibility that comets were the source of delivering water to Earth along with organic matter that formed proteins and aided life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, who began his term as governor earlier this year, signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "politically motivated and nonsense."
It was predicted that he would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system recognized by the FAA that will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transportation provided and trains will also not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available as of the occasion.
Fears of transportation shortages are increasing the possibility that the game will be forced to be held in a private venue without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports information on a new species of bird in the Ecuadorean Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species evolved in just two generations, even though this process was believed to take longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into all sorts of shapes. It can be hammered to make tiny shapes.
It can be drawn out into a thin wire, which can be bent and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and hammered onto other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, using clean, wet hands, take a handful and form it into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a tingling sensation and forming a frame-like structure.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with a flush in almost every house, and they were connected to a modern sewage system.
The remaining sewage systems were found in houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.

If you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then bounces it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent to space via a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and viewing.
It requires a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in unbelievable ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It gives us trains, cars, and many other transportation tools.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and one.
Ultimately, there are a lot of small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat a lot of small prey such as insects, mice, geckos, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a specialized job held by each cat that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most sociable of the cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one or three families of adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Usually, the women have close relationships with each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals strangely similar to lions (but not unlike big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and drag five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full roar of a lion, but rather like a cluster of angry and shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and hunt animals to eat (prey) by scent, smelling where they have been on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and can move very quickly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then quickly pouncing.
If a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (for example, if they move to hills or a stream, or if they move to a new island so they can no longer easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
This new environment has diverse resources and different competitions, therefore, the new population will require different traits or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
There has been no change in the original population; they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, their appearance gradually became different from other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. If there were no plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it had no fear, except for other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were filled with 70 razor-sharp teeth, with an extra set on the roof of his mouth, suggesting that nothing could escape once it passed through them.
We certainly don't know for sure, but it may have been a liar. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may also have been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. rex is no match for it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and the women eat their food while sitting on chairs, the rich people like to feast together, where they recline on their sides while they eat.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a principal temple known as a house of the god.
The people offer sacrificial offerings to the gods, and the priests try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Most of the special-shaped pyramid towers, called ziggurats, were built in the past to be part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the god.
In the sweltering climate of the Middle East, the house is not so important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women are cooking in the yard; the shops are open to the street. Stone is used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Not many people live in Greenland. In Norse stories, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while continuing to travel westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even so, that's not true. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The words are located at the very bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that in its early life, the large document paper (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was folded for storage.
Therefore, it's highly likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
This was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, calling the invasion "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and confronted Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that also describes the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A culture with civilization signifies that knowledge has been passed down through generations, highlighting heritage and equitable dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—of which Congress was the only part—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended upon state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He also doesn't have the authority to override the tax and tariff laws of the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states never really took the central government seriously because most of their representatives did not attend.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Cup champions in the year 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, which is why Italians compete in international games and the Olympics.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, it is commonly called an "archipelago" from a geographical standpoint.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift in the grain production practices of the aboriginals and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, where it ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a good idea of how they were originally made.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in still image photography worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film size after the analog film era.
This is still done today, but what's important is that the aspect ratio comes from the digital camera image sensor formats.
In reality, the 35mm format is, rather confusingly, 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters tall.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) are the same as or close to this aspect ratio.
The most abused and often mocked rule of thirds is simply a guide to create dynamism while maintaining some level of compositional order.
This states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersections of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, underwent scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the states of Europe despite their different languages and customs.
Sweeping power affects everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the leading Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church money exists for that reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this centralization of power and money has led many to question whether its teachings are being fulfilled.
Not long after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off significant military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated widely accepted international laws established in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the seas, and this endangered even neutral ships.
Since there had been a limited response to this tactic, Germany hoped for a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of the average citizens and the nation was pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations sought to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former work supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showcasing different stages of their history; each era in China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
Amidst each dynasty was an unstable period for the divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times, a fierce battle occurred between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China where thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
And also after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military because instead of the rank in the army being based on class, it is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this world. He would often go to a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, having endured through the ages, provides the clearest image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located atop a mountain in northern Mecca, the cave was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, it's not easy to find even if one knows it's there. Once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
Nothing could be seen except for the clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains. Very little of the world could be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to dedicate to the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built for the dedication of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built for the dedication of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "down bow" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Upward means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and downward means you should start at the end called the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while the down-bow is stronger and more aggressive.
You are very welcome to follow your own markings, but remember that there is a musical reason for the printed bowing marks there, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles because of a mob of market women.
Riding in the carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by riotous people shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The rioting crowd forced the window of the King and Queen's carriage to be opened.
At one point, a member of the mob paraded the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, in front of the horrified Queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the cost of the United States' imperialist war in its colonization of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime to fund a large portion of the expenses and the interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits gained from the long exploitation of the Filipino people may constitute the basic gains of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must first understand the context that led to the group's creation.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing many types of ideas in practice, from technology-push or technological imperative to the complete belief that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic combined with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one might argue that the automobile actually leads to improvements in roads.
However, the nationwide delivery system is not economically feasible for just a few vehicles, so there are new manufacturing methods to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
The prevalence of vehicle ownership leads to more road accidents, which has driven inventions and new techniques for repairing injured human bodies.
Romanticism has a significant part in cultural determinism, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes each individual, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerge, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, are better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It rose to prominence as a center of luxury that began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the twelfth century due especially to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts like silks and spices that were more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
During this time, the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style became popular in the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the era, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming that is practiced for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is simple, mostly organic, a system that uses saved seeds found in the ecological region, and is accompanied by crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in agriculture for subsistence, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to create an identity.
Subcultures can differ due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define subcultures as distinct can be due to linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often have a sign of their membership through a distinct and recognizable use of style such as fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of social interaction is to take some unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, involved in disasters, or deliberately abused, having no interaction with adults while they were growing up.
"Laaw" or wild is what the former children are called. Some wild children are abandoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child is due to severe physical and mental damage.
It is possible that feral children experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some of the animals were reportedly raised in captivity; others were said to have lived in the wild on their own.
If a child is raised entirely by animals, this feral child will exhibit behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely like the particular animal that cared for them, such as its fear or lack of concern for humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes beyond that.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support system that assists individuals who are undergoing new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, as is the little paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are included in the software and are intended to question, facilitate, and clarify procedures that might be too challenging for a student to manage alone.
The children were placed in foster care due to many reasons such as abandonment, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but some do.
We envision the Foster Care System as a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system is expected to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, strong education, and reliable healthcare.
The orphanage is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the homes they were taken from.
The Internet combines the two elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The diverse characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" have been suggested as significant motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" are also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has resulted in important discoveries in the interpretation of subtle expressions, facial movements that last only a few seconds.
Specifically, it is believed that one can detect when a person is lying by accurately mimicking subtle expressions.
In Oliver Sacks' essay The President's Speech, it is revealed that even people who cannot understand language due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two components of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection draws from this pool of diverse points.
Segregation and recombination randomly shuffle back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
Outside of the savanna, it's difficult for a monkey with a human-like digestive system to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the available plants there.
Furthermore, if this is not done, there are dangerous consequences: growth stunting, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest source of food to obtain is protein from leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for us primates to digest unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a high amount of protein containing all amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savanna monkeys do today.
Sleep cycling is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep cycle and going back to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This is easily done by using a silent alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself snoozing the alarm repeatedly, try placing it on the opposite side of the room so you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Some bio-rhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, known to promote urination) before bed, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of peace of mind a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
Less stress, more positive life energy now. Every person has the potential to find true peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only obstacle to reaching this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but expanded by the mahayana path of compassion and numerous techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is actually very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love towards all.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy pathways are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the realization of enlightenment becomes possible.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, which resulted in cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures resulted in misunderstandings between the nations.
In the two years after the war, former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
This will last for the next 40 years and must be fought in earnest by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had collapsed, and the remaining hope was to retreat and reorganize on Romanian soil.
However, these plans were revealed to be unusable in almost one night, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union invaded and created battlefields in Belarus and Ukraine after occupying the eastern region of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the best way to move large numbers of people and products across oceans.
The traditional job of navies is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and things, while at the same time, hindering the ability of the enemy to move their people and things.
One of the most prominent recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, aimed to stop this passage.
If the Allies had not been successful, Britain might have been conquered by Germany, as it conquered other parts of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats are usually herded and roam in the hills or other pastures, usually cared for by goat herders who are often children or young people, like the more well-known shepherd. These methods of raising goats are still used today.
Carriages have been made in England since the 16th century.
Even though wagonways consisted of the same wooden planks, they helped horses pulling them to move faster and haul heavier loads on the somewhat difficult roads of that day.
Crossties were introduced to hold the tracks in place. However, it was slowly realized that it would be better to have a steel surface on top.
This is a common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known means of transportation was walking. People started walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
What they followed, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as was customary.
Bipedal specialization is seen in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some areas.
This is only like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we must find the cause of the problems, and we must address that fundamentally.
It is clear that there has been a great change in the world due to human advancements in science and technology, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyles of people.
After it was accepted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft of the agreement signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printer John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
Between 150 to 200 copies were made overnight, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
On July 8, John Nixon first read the document publicly in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy of it reached London on August 10th.
Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist, they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call these birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them seem like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk using their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits, to use as a technical term in computing.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are common occurrences, so an immediate diagnosis of poisoning may not be made.
The best indication of poisoning may be the presence of open containers of medicine or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The word "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient experience with bed bugs, which are insects that have adapted to become parasites of humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disorder in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop Multiple Sclerosis as men.
The couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or for the well-being of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose or create an adoption plan for their potential child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of Science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
However, it's not alone; experimentation, an experiment being a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, also guides scientific research, along with questioning and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Latin Bible.
The accepted views on all things in science, including psychology, were those of Aristotle.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself disconnected from Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior sometimes crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic cues, have been demonstrated in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain their free-running cycles even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have varying effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only germ-line cell mutations can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the flora and fauna of wildlife.
Examples of indoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small towns travel by vehicle to their workplaces, some passing by others whose work destinations are in the same area they came from.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everything is interconnected and supports a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science now shows that these large carbon economies are removing the biosphere from one of the stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developing countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why are transportation systems receiving so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Do transportation engineers lack competence? Or is there something more significant happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers maintain reasonable speeds; as such, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better present the flow of traffic, a relationship is shown between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships can help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily escape predators and was also their way of getting food and finding mates more easily.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them more diverse places to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolves around the sun.
Some people believe he is correct, but many people also believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, since you can't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries 8 times the amount of water of the second largest river.
The widest river in the world is the Amazon, sometimes six miles wide.
The entire 20 percent of the water flowing in the planet's rivers to the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent nation in the world and the nation with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most state employees, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these are all found in nature in native form and are relatively simple to mine using ancient tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, had a theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements. Those are earth, water, air, and fire.
It's like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he considers that they can change and become new substances to form what we see.
Actually, alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the world is made of matter. All materials are also made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, because newer writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to fewer situations and uses.
People are writing on computer screens now, so there's no need to use erasers anymore.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when a newer one arrives.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
Like the act of rolling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus also takes effort and then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they have a tendency to break apart with little or no prompting.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the mountains.
There might be more maria in the near side because the crust is thinner. It's easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what people like or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that are inherent in them as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that causes them to do what they want, and what things in their environment cause them to do, or not do, certain things.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In short, two behaviors emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. One type is striving to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
Managers of this type have difficulty making decisions that upset people, taking disciplinary action, measuring employee performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable for their mistakes.
From another perspective, someone can transform into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
Often, this behavior results in misunderstandings between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams have the same basic skill requirements as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual group often act as the point of contact for their co-located physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a conventional group because their group can meet according to different time zones, which their local manager might not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the manager's team where each member reports. The invisible team sets the standard for individual members.
Why might an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One purpose for practically organizing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
If resources are used effectively by the operational departments of an organization, creativity and innovation will flourish.
As a result, the organizational process of uniting to work towards overcoming a barrier can lead to a new creative process in serving the needs of customers.
Before an organization can become innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defined the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating the mind. Therefore, it narrows down the research scope and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain disease and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies has allowed us to see and examine brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that can help us understand the processes of our minds.
Despite its strong connotations with science fiction, AI represents a significant branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
AI research involves creating machines to have machines perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct fields, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often, the teacher likes to take their students to places where traveling by bus isn't an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting with their class.
Virtual field trips are also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capitol, and every year the website is changed, but the old versions are left online to become a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is a reader presence.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to capture the audience's interest encourages students to be masterful and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "helps students become inquisitive and analytical; through actively responding to internet materials, students can determine their position in the context of the writings of others and in organizing their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the beautiful and bilingual capital of Canada, offering art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
In the far south lies Niagara Falls, and in the north you can find the natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
These things, and many more, highlight Ontario as the most perfect example of Canada from an outsider's perspective.
The vast areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that shocks most: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Currently, Madagascar is the largest, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxurious beach vacation spots.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these nations, and this had a major impact on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism followed in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The border of West Africa to the north is the Sahel, and to the south and west is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also help (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as disrespect, and things like being followed, having their arm pulled, etc., are common.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether there are cultural differences or not, this is not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a port called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt with the name Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
The city was rebuilt as Daru l-Badya by the Sultan of Morocco and was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trade there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop overall in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole line of trinkets, but all of this is just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma requires research to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also the jumping-off point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the most affordable Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Alongside the difficulty in accessing it, "Timbuktu" became a symbol of strange and faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included on the list of world heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
This is one of the major locations featured in the PBS special, Wonders of the African World, by Henry Louis Gates.
The city has a distinct difference from other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic influence than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Of all the South African National Parks, there are fees for daily conservation and park entry.
It can also be beneficial for a person to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to any of the options of parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is what gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that most tourists recognize as the most important.
The parade of buildings that makes up the Hong Kong skyline resembles a sparkling bar chart, made even clearer by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across the way.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is built on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place claimed by British colonizers, and if you're looking for evidence of this place's history, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80km (50 mi) into Bangladesh and the Indian countryside from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just mangrove swamps, but includes the remaining beautiful forests that are part of the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², about one-third of which is wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that it now has 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (near the creek) throughout the day, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthanh which leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because inter-district buses are often full, people are advised to buy tickets a few days before boarding.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, and these are said to be comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a length of 83 meters, a height of 378 meters, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to the public until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the customs checkpoints in Brazil are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous group living today in Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also farm.
The Chaco region is home to various indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, then called "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the era of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has found a way to maintain its native character and identity.
Argentina is very well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest match of the year will take place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the island's only bank, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted on the islands and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, even if British and United States currency might be; check with owners beforehand to find out what forms of payment are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer months, it is common for the temperature to reach +30°C.
Winter can be deceivingly cold: temperatures only sometimes drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel much colder than what the thermometer reads.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: rainfall remains fairly consistent throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the animals in the forest are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how gentle they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Furthermore, you should know that the smell can attract bears and other wildlife, so you should avoid bringing or cooking strong-smelling food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port is the site of a notorious incident involving the navy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British ship. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches because it is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these are sandy beaches safe for swimming, and most offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes these family-friendly beaches with a good array of shops lining the shore are crowded. Swimming is safe.
The leading local beer is 'Number One'; it's not a complicated beer, but it's satisfying and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
Many French wines have a long reach, but New Zealand and Australian wines probably have an even longer reach.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is new. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino has a lot of cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are also expensive but very good.
Many skydiving trips are done throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these skydiving causes are rare.
You should still take advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea snakes emerge on beaches near river mouths from October to April in the northern part of 1770. They can also sometimes be seen outside of these times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will just swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles are not actively inhabiting the sea, their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give travelers peace of mind knowing they have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, but you may find it possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also extend the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer, or obtain additional documentation for your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most attendees of music festivals decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you need to go early to get a camping spot near the music.
It should be remembered that even after the performances on the main stages have finished, there may still be performances in other areas of the festival until late at night.
Some festivals have special areas for camping for families with young children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's location, as passing through ice causes the most terrifying noise for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include city time. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos often try to ensure that guests don't waste time and money. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exit can be difficult to find.
Usually, they have special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to make them stay in that place.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment/affects understanding, and all master gamblers know the importance of staying conscious.
Anyone driving in high latitude areas or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is very little friction and you can't drive like you would on clear pavement.
During a snowstorm, significant snowfall is possible in a very short time, which could trap you.
Visibility may also be limited due to falling or blowing snow or due to condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, many countries normally have icy and snowy conditions, and traffic usually isn't disrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, in popular usage, refers to a journey on land to view the stunning wildlife of Africa.
It is likely that some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are approaching the vehicles, and common equipment can provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you are more likely to see them if you use binoculars.
Going on a safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "trekking") involves walking, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, your situation is likely difficult.
Cancellation policies vary, but around the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies were no longer being extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to get the fabric too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in severe situations, burning).
There are many ways to purify water, each more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others it takes a few minutes.
The effectiveness of water filters varies, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your own sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their regions of origin.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Communicable diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that harm or kill people by force, are not usually accepted as pests.
Duty-free shops offer the opportunity to purchase goods without paying taxes and excise duties in specific locations.
Sometimes, travelers going to countries with high taxes can save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The distance from Point Marion to Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often tracing a remote path behind the woods.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, remain cautious: there are many steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp curves.
Posted speed limits are noticeably lower than previous and subsequent sections—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is more important than it otherwise would be.
But, surprisingly, the mobile phone service is actually stronger here than anywhere else on this route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty, and in Bavaria, they are quite numerous and diverse, similar to their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, as apples are baked into pastries year-round, and plums are found in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you like a small but delicious pastry, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from spices and seasonings, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some of the coastal regions of the continent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a staggering variety of cuisines from regions found throughout the country.
However, if used without additional qualifiers, the term seems to imply that the food originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features many simple dishes, with the dominant seasonings favored by the Javanese being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
The stirrups support the passenger's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but there may be safety concerns due to the potential for the rider's feet to get caught in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this danger, there are many safety precautions that can be taken.
First, most riders wear boots with heels and smooth, somewhat narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.

Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and Norwegians opened the very first recreational ski club in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking by skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It's related, but usually doesn't involve alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on steeper slopes and requiring more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as similar to a hiking trail.
In good weather you can cover greater distances than walking - but you rarely get the speed of cross country skiing without a backpack on nice tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means going through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
In this respect, we can rather say that the Schengen zone is functioning as a single country.
As long as you stay within this zone, generally, you can cross borders without needing to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you no longer need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for man-made items that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies call items older than 100 years old as antiques.

Advisories are just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.

Rip currents are the return flow from waves that have broken on the shore, often found in channels and similar areas.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in certain deeper areas, and strong deep-water currents can form there.

Once you are out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try going somewhere you won't get caught again, or, depending on your ability and if you've been seen, maybe you'd prefer to wait for help.

A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
Shipping services, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions requiring long-distance information and voice communication, are frequently used.
Your local telephone service can provide more information about connecting to this service.
A popular and well-known option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school-leavers, allowing them to take a year off before entering university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can increase the chances of accessing higher education upon returning to your home country.
There is usually a tuition fee when registering for these education programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.

Shipping companies are paid well for the fast delivery of goods. Often, time is very important for business papers, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and with smaller companies, there is a problem.
If they send items via air freight, on some routes it can take several days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way for this to get through faster is to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow sending luggage without a passenger; that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this isn't cheap: as a general rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it's pointless to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there's a certain group of flyers willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
