This isn't just about confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, the theory has spread widely, but fossil details reveal more, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers have found that the fur of this animal is light chestnut brown on top or carotenoid in the bottom part.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers didn't have a central shaft that was perfectly formed, called a rachis, but were characterized by other feather parts — barbs and barbules — the researchers concluded that the rachis was like a later evolutionary development from these other characteristics.
The arrangement of these feathers suggests that they are not for flying but for regulating temperature or display. The researchers believe that even though this is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult feathers and lacks down feathers.

But, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident happened is currently closed while emergency services rescue the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was immediately treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From then on, Adekoya was in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
He was in the pre-trial detention and trial proceedings, but a lot of eyewitness evidence was scattered because his image had already been widely spread in public.
This is a common practice anywhere in the UK because the Scottish courts are different and the courts have seen publications of images that are likely to be damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee warned, "journalists are seen to be heading towards dangerous boundaries if they publish images of suspects and others."
The Crown's office, which is prosecuting the case completely, has suspended the few journalists who were talking too much, at least until the indictment is filed.
Based on the leaks, the document will refer to the border areas that Palestine wants as the basis for the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other covered topics were also reported, including the future capital of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requested the continuation of the military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement was signed, while the PA only agreed to leave the presence for five years.
The shooters in the pest control trial are being closely monitored by security forces, the trial is being supervised, and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers who meet the requirements are recruited, under the supervision of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director of Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received safety briefings and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in before the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), the new nine-member council, yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed the resignation of the previous CEP for the national measurement section towards the new elections.
The commission is Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, which were supposed to be held in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods that overheated have been reported, causing six fires and resulting in four people suffering minor burn injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry responded and said the postponement of Apple's report is "very regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office says that no damage has been reported domestically.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage and hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at a group of tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released beforehand, along with several fishermen from the Philippines.
The photography crew then replaced an old woman who needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in the medical field.
She trained as an obstetrics specialist and then began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at Liggins Hospital, he began researching premature births during his free time.
His research indicates that the administered hormones will accelerate fetal lung development.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' of the flight recorder on Wednesday.
Even fellow wrestlers also give respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the original Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the second month. There's nobody quite like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was just as weird as me... maybe even more so... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she is in a good place."
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, those opposing Australia becoming a Republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey stated the desire for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a Republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should not become a Republic.
He won Olympic gold medals in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming in three consecutive Commonwealth Games, but due to his declining fitness, his health is questionable.
He was no longer able to take medication to relieve his pain, so he was withdrawn from the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and Professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number on January 25th.
Several people examined the validity of the findings using various hardware and software starting in February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are thought to be a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, had begun his administration earlier this year and signed a bill into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He is based on news about "political discourse and humor".
He ran for president in 2016 to win.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to ground-based radar technology, to provide air traffic controllers with aircraft guidance and better precision, and to give pilots more accurate information.
There will be no additional transportation provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no car parking or park-and-ride facilities in the area.
The reason for the lack of transportation increases the possibility that the match will be forced to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study was announced on Thursday in a scientific journal that reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced a new species evolved in just two generations, even though this process was previously believed to take much longer, due to interbreeding between medium ground finches, Geospiza fortis, and immigrant cactus finches, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into many shapes. It can be rolled into a thin shape.
This can be drawn into thin wires, which can be twisted and woven. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and is connected to others. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to create hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Red cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (meaning a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry ingredients, then, using clean, wet hands, knead it until it forms a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel funny and form shells.
The cities in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in each house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Wastewater systems have been found in residential areas of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets became part of public bathhouses where men and women mingled together inside.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in outer space receive signals and then quickly reflect them back down.
Satellites are sent to outer space using rockets. Scientists use telescopes in outer space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and deceives us.
This uses giant rockets over 100 feet tall to put satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an amazing way. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a lot of convenience and faster transportation.
Technology has given us cars, motorcycles, and many other modes of transportation.
Below them, there is a medium-sized cat that eats medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to mouse-deer and deer.
Finally, there are many feral cats (including escaped pet cats) that eat a much wider variety of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the flexibility concept, a special ability that cats possess that differentiates them from others.
That lion is the most social cat, living in large groups called prides.
A group is formed from one to three, depending on the large male, and up to thirty females and their young.
The women diligently stay close to each other, forming a large family from siblings and daughters.
A pack of hyenas behaves like a pack of wolves or wild dogs, animals that are similar to lions (but not cats) in terms of behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, able to climb (even if not skillfully), swim, throw objects over long distances, and lift five times stronger than human strength.
That tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
The roar of a tiger isn't as complete as a lion's, but more like a growl, a shout of words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will try to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that Ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
It can see clearly in the dark with night vision and move stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding in the surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (in a small population) is separated from its main population where it originated (for example, if they move to a mountainous area or a river, or if they move to a new island so it is difficult for them to return), they will often feel that there is a different environment from what they used to have.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adapt to become stronger competitors than what they needed before.
The initial population hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adjustments as before.
As time passed, the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to pay less attention to and like the other population less.
Actually, thousands or millions of years ago, the two populations would have looked very different to the point where they couldn't be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means forming new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that's why we breathe).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses using plants and make clothes using plants. Most of the food that we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Its elongated jaws are filled with over 70 sharp, dagger-like teeth, complemented by an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We don't know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been cannibalistic.
Even just a leech attacks anything that enters the water, even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would be no match for a leech.
Even though most of the food seems familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual dishes, including wild boar, flamingos, snakes, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that poor people and women eat their food while sitting on chairs, while rich men prefer to hold feasts together where they lie down next to their food while eating their food.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods originating from Europe, America, or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey meat.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple that was believed to be the god's home.
The people brought offerings for those gods, and then the priests took care of the needs of those gods by holding ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and a sacred inner chamber that only priests can enter.
Their pyramids, specifically tower-shaped, called ziggurats, were built to be part of a temple.
The top of the tower is a sacred place for the god.
With the warm climate of the Middle East, houses aren't that important.
Most of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women are cooking in the yard; the shops are open facing directly onto the street. Stones are used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while sailing west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of their discoveries, the Eskimo people already lived there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, their kings, clothing, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watch the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Katia, this isn't right. Even though there's something written on the back of the document, this isn't a treasure map.
What is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The reading is at the bottom of the document, written in reverse.
Even if no one knows who wrote it, it was discovered just recently, that large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
That's why, this is just like a note that's been added as a label.
D-Day and the subsequent landings and battles had liberated northern France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
This was governed by "Vichy" France. These French people made peace with the Germans in 1940 and then worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, this invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French Liberation Army had liberated southern France and turned back to face Germany.
Civilization is a single culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word "civilis," meaning civil, related to the Latin word "civis," meaning resident, and environment, meaning city or city-state, and also however it defines the size of a society.
That city-state was the original state. Civilized culture means inheriting knowledge through several generations, a cultural footprint that is sustainable and widespread.
Subtle cultures often disappear, leaving behind no historical evidence and failing to be recognized as a proper civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen original states formed a weak central government—with the Congress being its only part—under the Articles of Confederation.
The council lacked the power to levy taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the authority of the states, which often did not help, to enforce all its laws.
This also does not have the authority to reject tax regulations and tariffs between countries.
These articles need unanimous agreement from all countries before they are amended and countries consider the central government essential whose representatives are pressured to be absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and also the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The sports I like include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and the Italians compete in international races and Olympic events.
Japan consists of around 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because of a cluster of islands owned by Japan, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as "the archipelago."
Taiwan originated in the 15th century when European sailors passed by and then recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in the implementation of aboriginal wheat cultivation and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty troops (1644-1912) controlled the western part of Taiwan and the northern part near the coast and recognized Taiwan as a Province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better picture of what they actually look like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic image format is still 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
This is still being made until now, because more importantly, the aspect ratio has been lowered to the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35mm format, actually, is a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The ratio is formed this way (divided into twelve parts to easily find the overall ratio) that's why it's called 3:2.
Many formats that are common (for example, APS family formats) are the same or closer to approximating this aspect ratio.
One of the most misused rules and often forgotten is the simple guideline of creating dynamism when maintaining the proportional measurements of an image.
This refers to the fact that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound European countries together despite differences in language and customs.
His power, which encompasses everything, affects everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main principles of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church monetary funds exist for that reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money makes many people question whether this principle is being fulfilled.
After the outbreak of hostilities, England began to blockade Germany's sea routes.
This plan is recognized as effective in cutting off vital supplies for the military and the population, even though this blockade violates established international regulations agreed upon in several international treaties in the last two centuries.
England is laying mines in international waters to target any ships entering all parts of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
That reward has a limited response for this plan; Germany considered the same response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, a strong attitude of most societies and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the devastation and brutality of war during World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with his ideas, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing time differences; each era in China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
And also, between each dynasty, this was a time of provincial fragmentation that was unstable. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
Throughout these eras, fierce battles involved nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying for the chance to sit on the highest throne in the empire in Xi'an.
There were many social and political influences such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
And also after that, the Revolution opened up opportunities for all male registrants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to advance.
Just like the military, nowadays army ranks are based on ability, no longer based on class.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond the worldly. He often went to a cave that was later named 'Hira' on Mount 'Noor' (light) to contemplate.
He meditated alone, enduring for days, which gave a clear picture of His spiritual desire.
Resting atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, that cave was extremely isolated from the outside world.
Actually, it's very difficult to find even though I already knew its location. Once you enter inside there, it's truly isolated.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear, beautiful sky surrounded by many mountains. Very little can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Refined by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like the letter V and the "down bow mark" looks like a staple or a box without the bottom part.
Above means you must start at the end and point the curve, and below means you must start at the frog (your hand follows the curve) and pull the curve.
Moving the bow up and down frequently produces a finer sound, while a lower, more arched bowing is stronger and firmer.
Just leave it up to you to create your own identity, but remember that the existing musical conventions are there for a reason, so they often have to be considered.
The formidable King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
Inside the carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open the chest as wide as possible.
Then one of the mob mockingly presented the head of the palace guard who had died at Versailles to the terrified Queen.
The cost of the American imperialist war in conquering the Philippines was paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial authorities of the United States, mostly to pay for the expenses and interest on floating bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Indeed, the profit taken from the prolonged suffering of the Filipino people is the basic profit of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the formation of the order.
The period in which the events occurred was the High Middle Ages in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages started after the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses various ideas in practice, from technological exigency or technological necessity to the strict reasoning that human destiny is controlled by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development progresses on its own, following steps that are largely outside the influence of culture or politics.
For example, people can say that cars definitely contribute to the development of highways.
Therefore, this national road network is not economically viable for even a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to the discovery of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism possesses a strong element of cultural determinism, influenced by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the matter of Romanticism, geography shapes experience, and over time, habits and cultures associated with that geography emerge, and this becomes more harmonious with the community and its place, better than imposed laws.
Because Paris is known as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople is considered the capital of feudal European fashion.
Known as a center of luxury, starting around 400 AD and lasting until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century, especially due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts like silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine Market could offer.
At that time, the title of Fashion Capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gutik style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Because of slow communication, fashion trends in the West can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the western European region began developing their own style. One of the biggest developments was caused by the Crusades, and people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is practiced to produce just enough food for the farmer and their family.
Agricultural life is simple, more natural, arranged using original ecoregion seed stock combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers are trapped in agricultural life, and this is still a problem in developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop their identity.
Subcultures can be different because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several reasons.
These subculture members often signal their membership through differences and use style for identification, which includes fashion models, behavior, and dialect.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to benefit some aspects of disadvantaged children because they are neglected, less fortunate, or abused, and not cared for by their parents as those children grow up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (often their own parents). Some cases of abandoned children are because their parents cannot accept their child's disabilities or physical defects.
This feral child may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
The others are suspected to have been disturbed by animals; some also say they used to live in the wild.
If truly raised by animals that do not resemble humans, the feral child would display habits (within physical limitations) closely resembling the animal that raised them.
Project-based learning makes learning more enjoyable and engaging, using scaffolding as a method to progress further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but rather assistance that provides support for people who are learning new experiences, such as new computer programs or starting new projects.
Scaffolds can be both, virtual and real, the point is, a teacher is a form of scaffolding but also like that paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual simulations are integrated into learning tools and are intended to observe, instruct, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to do on their own.
Various reasons exist for children being placed in foster homes, ranging from being neglected, abused, and even child exploitation.
No child should live in an environment that is not educational, does not care for them, and is uneducated, let alone them.
We feel that this Foster Home Arrangement is a safe place for these children.
Our foster care aims to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and adequate healthcare.
Foster homes aim to provide all the needs that they couldn't get at home before being placed here.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet create an additional dimension in terms of usage approaches and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are recommended as important motivations for Internet usage (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings leads us to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last milliseconds.
Specifically, to the point where someone can tell if they're being deceitful or not by interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his writing President's Speech, mentions how people who cannot understand words, due to brain damage, can accurately assess sincerity.
He also added that the ability to interpret human habits can be distinguished from animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and visible.
Migration introduces new genetic variations, and selection removes variation from the visible group.
Separation and unification of language have created a back-and-forth mix of variations between the two groups and each of their generations.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to satisfy their amino acid needs from the available plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
Existing plant sources that can provide protein are in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates to digest unless cooked first.
Conversely, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digested, but it also provides a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
What needs to be considered is that we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees currently do in the savanna.
Sleep disturbance is a process of intentionally waking up during regular sleep hours and then going back to sleep later (10–60 minutes).
This can be done by using an alarm that isn't too loud, to make us aware but not really wake you up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm while still asleep, try putting the alarm clock on the other side of the room from where you sleep, this will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on rhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (water or tea, which makes you urinate) before going to sleep, causing us to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive life energy is present. Every person has the possibility to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and rigidity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. Its principles consist of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of loving everything.
And Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) awakens through yoga movements, training breathing, awareness, and visualization.
That Tibetan meditation center is Yoga Diwa. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, inner energy is activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was the enemy of almost all countries in World War 2, causing cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. And at the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the fall of nations.
After two years of war, the former allies became enemies again and the Cold War began.
This lasted for up to 40 years and was fought for in a real way, by military representatives, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in other places as well.
On September 17, 1939, the defense of the Polish people collapsed, and their hope was to surrender and retreat to the border and the Romanian headquarters.
Reportedly, this plan was considered obsolete overnight, when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and put Belarus and Ukraine against each other after invading eastern Poland, violating the Peace of Riga treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to send goods is the most appropriate way to send goods and people in large quantities across the ocean.
The job of naval forces is to ensure that our country maintains the ability to send our goods and people, while also hindering the enemy's ability to send their goods and people.
One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to send their people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to support England.
At the same time, the German Navy, mostly using U-boats, tried to stop this transportation route.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to subdue England like other European countries.
Goats were probably first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Domesticated water buffalo and tribal people began raising them to obtain milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Local goats are usually raised in herds that roam the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who are mostly children or teenagers, similar to diligent shepherds. This method of raising them is still used today.
Railways were built in England at the beginning of the 16th century.
Even though the carriages are just made from joined wooden planks, they allow horses to pull them at top speed and haul bigger loads than on rough roads every day.
Cross ties were first introduced to hold the rails in place so they wouldn't move. Gradually, they realized that the rails could be even more secure if there were steel bars on top of them.
This became a common experiment, but the iron made the wooden wheels of the wagon wear out faster.
That's why, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails were introduced.
Initially, the transportation we know was just walking; humans have been able to walk upright since two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
In the past, Australopithecus didn't walk upright as often.
Bipedal specialization was found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living an environmentally friendly life again, we can join environmental movements, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering.
This is like a symptom of treatment in most cases. Then, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem, and we must reject it as well.
It is very clear that the world has changed a lot due to the advancement of human knowledge and technology, and the problems have become very large due to overpopulation and excessive human lifestyles.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent several blocks to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of that document was by John Nixon on the Independence Hall grounds on July 8th.
One had been sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. Handwritten copies no longer exist.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and live until today. They are what we call birds.
Many people don't know that they are also dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But a lot of that bird still looks like a dinosaur.
They have scaly and wrinkled legs, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Essentially, all computers used today are based on information processing that is manipulated by codes from binary numbers.
A single binary number can only have one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and this number is also considered a binary digit - or a bit, to use computer language.
Poisoning in the body is true that it is not immediately visible. Symptoms, such as nausea, are signs that an immediate examination cannot be done.
A good indicator of poisoning in the body is the presence of open medicine containers or poisonous household chemical equipment.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions as well as for the type of poison.
The term pest is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the old families and bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Carrion beetles and bedbugs are both nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or home of their host.
Across the United States, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A married couple can decide if raising the baby is not in their best interest, or the best interest of their child.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their babies.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their rights as parents so that another couple can become parents to the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method essentially guides most scientific research.
However, it's not just that, experimentation and experiment are tests used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations, as well as guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical readings, especially the Bible in Latin.
What was received was the Aristotelian view on all matters of knowledge, including psychology.
As knowledge about Greece declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, some of which are merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustained oscillator that can continue its cyclical periods freely even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments that labeled the DNA in phages with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wild animals.
Examples of activities in the field include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning information about ecosystems.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in the countryside by car to go to their workplaces, and are passed by others who are just returning from their work.
In this dynamic back-and-forth vehicle, everyone is somehow connected and supports a vehicle system based on individual cars.
Current scientific knowledge indicates that this large carbon economy has released the biosphere from one of the stable conditions that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developing countries, you rarely hear complaints of the same level regarding water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why does the transportation system receive such complaints, why does the transportation system fail every day? Are the transportation technicians incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
That traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the relationships they have with each other.
Unfortunately, learning traffic flow is very difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to be quite similar; therefore, traffic flow tends to have strong similarities and can be modeled mathematically.
To indicate the best traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operations of highway facilities.
Insects are the first animals that fly. Their ability to fly helps them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This allows them a wider range of smaller places to hide from predators.
Currently, one type of insect that cannot fold its wings back is the dragonfly and damselfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people think he is right, but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. This river carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, its width reaching six miles.
Approximately 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers on this planet into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. This river collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids never surpassed their size and technical excellence in construction.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt was amazed by their ancestors' monuments, which were already a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most people who work in that country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they are all found in nature in their native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made from a mixture of one or more of four elements. Those are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is actually a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metal elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of atoms can fit within the period at the end of this sentence.
That's why, the pencil became a close friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, because newer writing methods have emerged, pencils have been relegated to a lower position and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, no longer needing to approach a pencil sharpener.
People can only imagine what kind of role models they'll become when something new arrives.
Nuclear fusion works based on the principle that energy is required to combine nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy cart uphill. Separating the nucleus and then releasing some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they readily decay with little or no provocation.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
That crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
Thin beneath the sea and thick on high ground.
There might be a lot of magma near the surface because the crust is thin. Molten lava easily rises to the surface.
The theory focuses on finding what motivates or attracts people.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they age.
This theory looks at what motivates certain people to want things they do and what aspects of their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when a manager starts leading their former subordinates. One end of the spectrum involves trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
A manager like this experiences difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and demanding accountability from people.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone transforms into an unrecognizable figure who feels they must change everything the group has done and make it their own.
Whatever happens, the ultimate leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes friction between leaders and other group members.
Virtual groups have similar performance standards to traditional groups, but with slight differences.
Virtual group members are often used as contact points for their direct physical groups.
They often have greater autonomy than traditional group members because their group can meet according to different regional schedules that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"The invisible group" refers to the management group to which each member reports. The invisible group sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to establish a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing the organizational learning concept is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can spread.
As a result, the organizational process divides work to overcome obstacles so that it can encourage new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as organizational knowledge and shared learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognitive research, in order to narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that differences in the type of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in various mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes within our minds.
Even though AI has strong scientific connotations, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Things like that have become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems today are often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as has been developed in some home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are a big part of any class. It's not very often that a teacher wants to take their students, even though using a bus is the only option, to a place.
Technology offers solutions for virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing virtual travel experiences is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is updated, but the old versions remain available as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with grammar and spelling that are still messy, the presence of a guide generally changes that.
Because students are the most critical guides, the blogger began trying to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Trying to write a blog that "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to feed interest to the audience inspires students to become smart and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The consistent use of blogs "can empower students and make them more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can establish their position within the context of other writings and also express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, which is attractive and bilingual, and features various art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north are the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more highlights Ontario as what is considered the most representative of Canada by outsiders.
The vast area far to the north is sparsely populated, and some of the deserts nearby are uninhabited.
For comparison, a fact about population that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the US than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
So far, Madagascar is the largest and a continent of its own in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries, or affiliated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
Arab people also brought Islam to those countries, and spread it widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonization by Europe started in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, this region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every female tourist say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It really helps too if you wear a ring (just not one that looks expensive).
Women should be aware that different cultures can lead to what they perceive as mockery and are often accompanied by, hands on hips, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for your beliefs (different cultures or not, that doesn't make everything okay!).
The city of modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the busiest places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava originating from Mount Nyiragongo, which buried almost all the roads, especially in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, every movement outside of Goma must be examined to understand the war situation happening in North Kivu province.
This city is also a gateway to climb Mount Nyiragongo, alongside the cheapest Gorilla trekking route in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Due to its difficult accessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
This is one of the main gathering places during Wonders of the African World, a PBS special by Henry Louis Gates.
You are guaranteed to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails winding near the Falls.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
This park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-regions, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a highlight of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Similar to all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
This might also be useful for someone who purchases a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name, and this area is considered a top destination for tourists.
The parade of buildings that creates the Hong Kong skyline is likened to a sparkling bar graph reflected by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across the way.
A large part of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is a place that was taken by the British colonizers as their own, and so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of that area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest area in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) into the inland areas of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian region is called Sundarbans National Park.
These mangrove forests are among the last remnants of the mighty forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans protect an area of 3,850 km², about one-third of which is covered by water/swampy areas.
In 1966, the Sundarbans became a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
These buses depart from the bus station (crossing the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Taxis are a fast and convenient means to explore nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. Its span across the Oyapock River connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers soar to a height of 83 meters, and have a length of 378 meters with two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
15 meters stand upright under the bridge. The building was completed in August 2011, but it could not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be officially used in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection facility is nearing completion.
The Guaraní are an indigenous group who primarily reside as the people of Eastern Paraguay today, living semi-nomadically as hunters who also cultivate farmland in the surrounding area.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups as well, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, farming, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born from the meeting of Spanish landowners and native tribal groups.
The Spanish were also the first during the colonial period for three centuries.
Since the founding of the city of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain its original character and its people's identity.
The Argentina we know also has one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The big competition that is held every year in December takes place at the Las Cañitas polo field.
Smaller competitions and contests can be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about the competition and where to buy polo competition tickets, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which has the same value as one British Pound (GBP).
The money can be deposited at any bank on the island, specifically in Stanley, past the FIC West store.
British Pounds are also generally accepted anywhere around the island and credit cards in Stanley and US Dollars can sometimes be used as well.
On remote parts of the island, various credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currency can be brought; check with the owner beforehand to determine which payment methods are accepted.
It's probably impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the island; exchange your money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is in the south of the Equator, it has summer when it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; during the summer months, it frequently exceeds +30°C.
This winter is truly cold: the temperature can sometimes be below freezing, but also the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There is no concept of "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though there are many animals in the park that are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Based on the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from the bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of their forms, fortresses, deer, big deer, bears, and even other animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, be aware that enticing smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food with strong odors and maintain the cleanliness of your campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
That port was the location of a famous naval anchorage in 1889 when seven sloops from Germany, the US, and England refused to leave the port.
The entire fleet sank, except for one British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of their high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is located between two harbors. The three most well-known places are:
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches have sand and safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, on the edge of the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is a family beach that is sometimes crowded with many shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Nomor Satu' (Number One), which is a complex beer, but refreshing and invigorating. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that must be tried, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be cheaper.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is very easy to find if you are worried.
For Australians, the term "kopi susu" is commonplace. The small black one is 'espresso', cappuccino is surrounded by lots of cream (not foam), and tea is made without milk.
The hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards. The juice is expensive but very delicious.
The boat trips to that reef are held all the time, and injuries caused by the coral are minor.
Please listen to instructions from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are present near the beaches and around river mouths from October to April since the north in 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of these times.
That shark is there, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to stay away.
Estuarine crocodiles are not actively found in the sea, their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
The resort prioritizes giving visitors peace of mind by assuring them that they will have a place to sleep after they arrive at their destination.
Ticket sellers often have agreements with certain hotels, but you can try to find alternative accommodations, such as campsites, through travel agents.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combine flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your trip (such as a visa).
Every change or request must be communicated to the ticket seller first and cannot be done directly with the hotel.
For several festivals, most participants who joined the music festival decided to camp at the location, and most of the participants also considered it an important experience.
If you want to be close to the performance, you have to come early to get a camping spot that's close to the music.
It must be remembered that even though the music performances are finished on the main stage, there's a possibility that some parts of the festival will continue playing music until very late at night.
Some festivals have dedicated camping areas for families with children.
When crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location first, because passing through the ice will cause quite a bit of noise that can be frightening for even the most hardened people.
As cruise ships enter St. Petersburg. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from needing a visa (check the requirements).
Casinos typically make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. Clocks and windows are usually absent, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the guests' mood good, and to keep them in their place.
Several places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all skilled gamblers should know the importance of staying sharp.
Anyone who wants to drive at high altitudes or cross mountains must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or extremely cold or freezing temperatures.
On snowy and icy roads, the friction is low, and you can't drive like you do when driving on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, snow can easily make you trapped and can cause you to suddenly fall.
Visibility can also be reduced by snowfall or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is not disrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are a major tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in general usage refers to land journeys to see the extraordinary wildlife in Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, are always close to vehicles and standard equipment to provide good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are known to be shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "bushwalking", "hill walking", or "footing") consists of walking, whether for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Several matches will be held in different places throughout Japan.
Tokyo is set to become the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you are likely in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March the cancellation policies were most based on March 2020, after the Olympics were rescheduled.
It is estimated that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have ironing boards and irons available for loan, or if not available in the room.
If there's no iron available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful to ensure the fabric doesn't get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in other places, several more minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter animals that are not native to their place of origin.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation or itching, spread poison, and spread infection.
Contagious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans cannot be categorized as pests.
Shopping duty-free is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain places.
People who travel far and like to travel to other countries with high taxes can save a lot of money, if they don't buy alcoholic beverages and tobacco too much.
The straight road between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through wooded islands on the roadside.
If you're not used to driving on village roads, be careful when navigating narrow, winding, and hairpin turn roads, prioritize safety.
The clearly visible speed limits are lower in the back and coming sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is very important to obey the regulations.
But also, strangely enough, cell phone service is faster here compared to the straight roads on other routes, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The cakes in Germany are quite delicious, and in Bavaria, there are quite a lot and a variety of them, similar to those of their neighbors in the southern part of Austria.
Fruit preparations are common with apples cooked into tarts for pastry week, and cherries and plums make an appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small, various kinds of cakes, it depends on the region, being called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Karih is a dish whose basic ingredients are spices, and meat or vegetables.
Karih can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of gravy.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a term that encompasses and covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
This is widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a variety of dishes with rich spices, the predominant spices favored by Javanese people are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups support the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but also increase attention and safety because of the rider's own potential for their feet to not get stuck inside.
If a rider falls from a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs. To minimize this risk, several safety measures are used.
Initially, most racers used thin-soled shoes that fit the heel, were quite tight, and had soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup leather to fall away from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various massive granite walls and cliffs.
