This not only confirms that dinosaurs at least had feathers, a theory already widespread, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional composition.
Scientists say that the feathers were brown on top with a yellow or orange lower part.
The discovery also shows the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a very developed rachis, but do have other parts of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers reasoned that the rachis was perhaps an evolutionary development that came later than these other elements.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying but rather for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers pointed out that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not down.
Researchers have indicated that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult and not of a chick.

It was discovered that the Sun behaved according to the same basic principles as all other stars: it had been discovered that the activity of all stars in the system was driven by luminosity and radiation, and nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic cycles.

The work has been mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made with the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing the tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to discover that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and is made of many particles.

In France, traditionally voting has been a low-tech experience: the voter isolates themselves in a booth, puts a pre-printed paper indicating their choice inside an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in a ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral law regulates the processes very strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added apart from those of the voters counted and authorized in a regular manner.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes with strong supervision, following specific procedures.

The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.
In any case, the person who was driving suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was closed for a while, while the emergency services were extracting the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterward, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya then appeared in the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh, accused of killing her son.
She is in custody awaiting trial, but some eyewitness evidence may be ruined because her image has been published many times.
This is a common practice in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as a possible prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee makes it clear that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspected people."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which has overall control of the proceedings, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the formal indictment.
According to the source, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be those before the 1967 Middle East war.
It seems that other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years from when the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to allow this presence for five years.
The sharpshooters of the supplementary pest control test would be closely supervised by the park rangers while the test was conducted and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteer shooters have been recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's culling program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the conservation and heritage director for the park with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received complete safety instructions and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) as part of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that had begun in Léogâne.
The protests, sometimes violent, had been triggered by the failure to hold elections, which were due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating defective iPods have been reported, which have caused a total of six fires and minor burns in four people.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has said that there have been reports of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had reported 34 incidents of overheating, which the company defined as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report delay "truly incomprehensible."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 in the morning local time (09:19 in the afternoon GMT Friday).
The emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands has stated that no damage has been reported in the nation.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has stated that there are no indications of a Tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by diverting their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
At least six are confirmed dead, so far. A number of hostages have been saved.
The kidnapped, including children and the elderly as well as the Filipino photographers, have been released.
The photographers then took the place of an old woman who needed the bathroom. Mendoza was killed.
He followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She studied as a midwife and started working at the National Women's Hospital of Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the Liggins hospital, he had started studying premature birth, in his free time.
His research had shown that if a hormone were administered, it would have accelerated fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black box' flight recorders.
Even former wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first director. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Unique like her. Strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as extravagant as me…maybe even more so…I love her and I will miss her…I hope she is in a more beautiful place”.
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal election, those who are against Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the people in the survey share this view, as they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last sovereign of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of the people interviewed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while for 31 percent Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his form has been in doubt.
He couldn't take the medicine to make the pain go away because it was banned by the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Numerous people have verified the discovery using different machinery and programs since the beginning of February, and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets might have been sources of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how Earth formed, from when comets struck it a long time ago to today.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor at the beginning of the year and last month he signed a law that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He defined the voices as "rattling noises and political machines".
It is said that he wanted to run for president in 2016.
Nextgen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, unlike the older technology based on ground radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate the aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport has been activated and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park and ride facilities are not available overground.
Concerns that transportation might be lacking have led to considering the possibility of playing the match behind closed doors, without the fans of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports on the formation of a new species of finches in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would have taken much longer, due to the selection between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch, a migrant, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be made into very small shapes.
It can be inserted into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or made into sheets.
It can be worked very finely and inlaid in other metals. It can be made so fine that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the total of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Put the peppers together and then, with clean hands, arrange them in a jar.
The moisture of your hands will react with the outer layers, which will change and form a crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women went together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space takes the bite and sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and vision.
You need a large rocket, taller than 100 feet, to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to have given us easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car, and other means of transport have beaten us.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
In the end, many small felines (including free-roaming domestic cats) eat numerous other prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of the niche, a specific task that each feline performs that saves it from competition with the others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups, prides.
The groups are composed of one to three adult male relatives, with a maximum of thirty females and offspring.
The women tend to be related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides function similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are strikingly similar to lions (but not other large felines) in behavior, and also very deadly to prey.
A complete athlete, the tigress knows how to climb (though not well), swim, make very long jumps, and push with a force five times that of a man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These three felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a phrase of muttered and shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they hunt weasels, voles, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than itself.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find their prey (animals to eat) by scent, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment and pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the larger population from which it comes (such as moving to a mountainside or a river, or moving to a new island and being unable to easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment than where it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need more than before new qualities or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they begin to become increasingly different from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be able to be considered of the same species.
This process is called speciation, which indicates precisely the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants receive nourishment from the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they provide shade.
From trees we make our houses, and our clothes. A good part of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to live.
The mosasaur was the top predator of that time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its jaws are furnished with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with others in the palate, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed that path.
We don't know for sure, but perhaps it had a forked tongue. In its diet there were turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps it was even a cannibal.
Moreover, it would attack anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex wouldn't have been a problem for it.
Since most of their loot would be known to us, the Romans had their share of curious and rare festive objects, including deer, parrots, kookaburras, and a type of rodent they called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting in chairs, the rich liked to snack together while lying on their side.
In the meals of the ancient Romans, there could not be foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomato, nor potato, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians had erected a main temple to each of their gods, which they considered the house of the god.
The people would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to attend to the needs of the gods with rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes very special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary in honor of the god.
With the hot climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't such an important thing.
The majority of a Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There weren't large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was as expensive as fire.
Greenland was colonized in stages. In the stories of the Norsemen, they say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for homicide, and when he was traveling further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But putting this discovery aside, the Eskimo tribes had already been living there for a long time.
Since each country was 'Scandinavian', there were several differences in terms of population, kings, customs, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Anyway, this isn't true. Maybe there's something written on the back of the document, but it's not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the other side of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text appeared on the bottom, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that initially, the large parchment of the document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) had been rolled up for archiving.
Then, it could be that the annotation was only added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had freed the north of France, but the south was still to be liberated.
It was governed by the French "Vichy" regime. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had worked together with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies had invaded southern France, calling the invasion "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and French forces, having landed, had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture that unites a group of a certain size of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, linked to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which defines in some way the greatness of society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A culture of civilization requires a knowledge that is passed down from one generation to another, a lasting cultural footprint, and honest dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states had formed for the first time a weak central government - with the Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had lost all power to impose taxes, and, due to the fact that there was no national executive or judiciary, they relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all their acts.
He had no authority, not even to disregard fiscal laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent of all states before being ratified, and the states had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second team with the most wins in the world and was the FIFA world champion in 2006.
Popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more well-known in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international sports and Olympic events.
The Japanese have about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which make Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often defined, in a geographic sense, as "an archipelago."
Taiwan's history begins in the 15th century when European sailors passing by gave the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in the indigenous wheat production activities and putting Chinese workers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized the western part of Taiwan and the stretches of the northern coasts, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, which are called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of how they looked originally.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been restored, and the restoration still continues today.
For example, the most common still image photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the period of analog films.
Today it is still produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratios are inherited from those formed by the image sensors of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, imprecisely, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore what is called 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, so abused and often derided, is a guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
He stated that the best place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united the states of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
His power, present everywhere, had caused damage to everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth usually alleviates suffering and that the church's monetary funds are specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven beneficial, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, as this blockade violated international law generally accepted and codified with various international agreements in the last two centuries.
Great Britain had mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering neutral ships as well.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the sentiment that most citizens and nations shared was that of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations desired to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison company in New York.
He had arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China was unique in displaying different periods of time; each phase of China or each heir that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Even between each dynasty there was a troubled age of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there had been a fierce war between several nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with millions of people dying fighting to sit on the highest throne of the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are a multitude of social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single governor alone.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were open to all men who applied, giving the most ambitious and brilliant the opportunity to succeed.
The same applies to the army, where military ranks, instead of being based on class, are now based on merit.
The French Revolution also greatly inspired many other repressed people of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to retreat to a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived through the years, provides a very clear picture of the spiritual habits of Muhammad.
Perched on the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, it's not easy at all to find even if one knows of its existence. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Only a small piece of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of the death of the Pharaoh.
In the Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arc up" symbol looks like a V, and the "arc down" symbol is like a bracket or a square that has lost its bottom side.
"Upwards means you should start from the tip and load the bow, and downwards means you should start from the nock (where the hand is holding the bow) and load the bow."
An up bow usually generates a softer sound, while a down bow is stronger and more decisive.
Feel free to mark your signs with a pencil, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so usually you have to respect them.
King Louis XVI, dismayed, Queen Marie Antoinette, their children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, on October 6, 1789 were forcibly brought back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of women from the markets.
In a carriage, they had returned to Paris surrounded by a throng of people shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd of people had forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of the carriage.
At one point a member of the mob swung the head of a dead guard from Versailles at the frightened queen's face.
The U.S. imperialism's war expenses in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S.A. in order to return the majority of the expenses and the interest on bonds that had been incurred in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
As is obvious, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute a source of income for U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is essential to understand the context that led to the order's creation.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Early Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Antiquity and followed by the High Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technology push or the technological imperative to a narrow sense that human destiny is guided by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Beyond the interpretations of technological determinism, they share two ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that surpasses cultural or political influence, and that technology, for its part, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than conditioned by society.
For example, one could say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not suitable for a spread of vehicles only, so new production methods are being developed to minimize the cost of vehicle ownership.
The property of increased vehicle mass also leads to a rise in road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to treat the physical damage to people.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, shaped by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and in the course of time, the customs and culture tied to this geography came to the fore, and these, being in harmony with the place and society, were better than laws imposed in an arbitrary way.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its condition declined during the twentieth century because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices that were valued much more than those offered by the Byzantine market.
It was then that the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style arrived in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
In any case, due to the slowness of communication channels, styles in the West could remain behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its style, one of the greatest steps of the time; as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough resources to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses conserved seed originating in the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other more or less simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers were employed in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized from societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or combined factors.
Members of a subculture often signal belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is designed around a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, disasters, or deliberate abuse, adults failed to socialize while they were growing up.
Therefore, those children are called "agrestes" (wild). Some "agrestes" children have had restrictions from people (usually the parents themselves); in some cases this abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a severe physical and mental disability.
The wild children may have had a severe experience of child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others think that animals raised them; some say that they lived in the forest on their own.
When animals that are not human completely raise him, the feral child shows (within physical limits) almost completely behaviors like those of an animal to be cared for, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While a project based on learning would make it easier and more interesting, the scaffolding one is a step backwards.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals who are in the midst of a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real; in other words, a trestle is a form of scaffolding, but so is the formatting grid in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are embedded within the program and are meant to ask, advise, and explain procedures that could have been confusing for the student to handle alone.
The children are placed in foster care for a range of reasons that vary from lack of care, to abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that lacks nurturing, care, and education, but it is so.
We see the foster care system as a free zone for these children.
Our family foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Family fostering is supposed to meet all the needs that are lacking in the home from which the child was taken.
The internet combines both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The marked characteristics of the Internet lead to other dimensions when speaking of a flow based on uses and gratification.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are indicated as important reasons for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continued relationship" were also noted as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied visitors' reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his publication *The President's Speech*, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nonetheless able to ascertain the truth with care.
He even suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that there are groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Inbreeding and recombination shuffle and reshuffle the variation among groups in each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to compensate for the loss of amino acids from plant resources available.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Most of the vegetable resources directly accessible would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking them.
On the contrary, the food of animals (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but provides a large quantity of proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, it wouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problems" somewhat in the same way as chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of deliberately waking yourself up during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a more or less quiet alarm clock to lead you to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock when you're asleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension one holds in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that remains in the way of this goal is the tension we hold and being negative.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and a multitude of Indian yoga techniques.
In the beginning, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces all.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the yoga deity. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was an enemy in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clashes of system, process, and culture led the countries to be in conflict.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years and they had truly fought, with proxy armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
From September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to regroup and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
In any case, these plans were already obsolete by night, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union had entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most suitable way to move large quantities of people and goods across the ocean.
The traditional job of naval forces has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, and at the same time, interfere with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had begun to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally raised in flocks that grazed on hills or other pasture areas, often tended by goatherds who were almost always children or young boys, similar to the more well-known shepherds of sheep. These grazing methods are still used today.
The wheels had been manufactured in England since the 16th century.
Even though the wheels were simply parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and pull bigger loads than on the somewhat more bumpy roads of that time.
The sleepers had been quickly added to support the rails in their place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the rails would have been more efficient if they had had an iron band on top.
This had become common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known transport was on foot, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the stage of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
The predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright habitually.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs from seven million years ago.
We can start living with more respect for the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is only a treatment of the symptoms, in many cases. In any case, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is quite normal that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of humans.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a copy signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was then sent some blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in Independence Hall Plaza on July 8th.
One had been sent to George Washington on July 6th, who was to read it to the troops in New York on July 9th. A copy had reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is living today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are a ton of things about birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and can walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers refer to binary digits - or bits, to use the language of computers.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general to allow for a quick diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The word "babballoti" is used etymologically in a formal sense for this group of snakes.
This word comes from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects adapted to parasitize human beings.
Whether they are bird mites or bed bugs, they make their nests, adapted to live there or in the homes of their hosts.
Throughout the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
The research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have an MI (myocardial infarction).
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or in the interest of the child, to raise a child.
This couple is considering making an adoption plan for their daughter.
In an adoption, the birth parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can assume legal guardianship of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works, using the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides the majority of scientific research.
Therefore, it is not only experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, even asking questions and observing that guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and, above all, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific topics, including psychology.
With the decline in the knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed the rhythms in physiology and behavior often decisively depends on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external stimuli, have been documented for a large part of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient regulatory organs that continue to follow free-running cyclical periods even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects that depend on the type of mutation, the amount of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are in the germline.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscapes, the plants, and the wildlife.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks, and the study of information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning things about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from the small towns of the countryside go to work by car and pass others who have the work destination in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth of transport, everyone is connected in some way, and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has separated the biosphere from one of its stable states, which supported human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is difficult to hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of the water or bridges that collapse.
Why do transport systems generate these complaints, why do they have problems every day? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something else more important happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they may have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be more or less mathematically represented.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three characteristics: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operations of infrastructure.
Snakes were among the first animals to start flying. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most snakes have the advantage of knowing how to fold their wings behind their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that don't know how to feather their wings are flies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus had said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many people thought the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems to make sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon river is the second longest and the largest on Earth. It carries more than eight times the amount of water of the second river.
The Amazon is also the widest part of the Earth, sometimes six hundred miles wide.
A good 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were astonished by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then already more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is more or less 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the one with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of those who work for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, because these can be discovered in nature and in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he theorized that they change into other substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. It is clear that there are also metals like silver and gold.
They can also be alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of very small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Back then, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, since other writing methods have been born, the pencil has been relegated to minor status and uses.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to have a pencil sharpener nearby.
One wonders what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes out.
A fission bomb works according to the principle of taking energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again then releases part of that energy.
There are atoms that have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no stimulus.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There should be more seas on the visible side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what motivates or attracts passionate people.
These theories suggest that people have needs and/or desires that have been internalized with growth into adulthood.
These theories look at what is upon certain people that makes them want to do the things they do and what things in their environment lead them to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start managing former colleagues. One side of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys (or girls)."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning competencies, and giving responsibilities.
On the other side of the scale, someone turns into a never-before-seen person who thinks they need to change everything the team has done and that they need to do it alone.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Often they have more autonomy than members of a conventional team, as the teams can meet according to time zones that might not be understood by the local administration.
The presence of a real "invisible team" as well (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administration team to which the members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to pursue the long process of establishing organizational learning? One goal for putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a consequence, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create both a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum perspective as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical perspective on research into cognition, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports scientists in their research.
For a long time, it was believed that different types of damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors of the brain affected behavior and caused changes in some mental function.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study the structures and processes of the brain never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI is an important part of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
AI research deals with making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The features include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, such as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Today's AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every class. Often a teacher would like to take students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire works of art sitting with the class.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a beautiful way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state's capital, every year this site is remodeled, but the old versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
Even blogs can help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with superficial grammar and spelling, the presence of a public audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, whoever writes in the blog should make an effort to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, creating a blog "obliges students to become more expert on the world that surrounds them." The need to nurture the public's interest inspires students to be knowledgeable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Creating a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond a traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the writing of others while also developing their perspectives on particular topics (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the elegant and bilingual capital of Canada and features a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
At the extreme south are the Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka, and not only that.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as being considered the quintessential Canadian province by outsiders.
The larger areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost wild, uninhabited land.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The African Islands of the East are in the Indian Ocean, far from the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
A good portion of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs had also brought Islam to those lands, especially in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region's border is the Sahel, and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all women traveling say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (even one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can surface in what they consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stand firm refusing men and do not be afraid to empower your position (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and used by Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese had destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dari I-Badya and it received the name Casablanca from the Spanish merchants who had established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the easternmost part bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside the city should be studied to understand the combat situation raging in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for ascending the Nyiragongo volcano and for doing some of the cheapest gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The usual price (locally) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in strong contrast with the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arab style than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends to the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and to the southern border of the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is daily upkeep and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry either to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists view as the main location.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's urban skyline have been compared to a bright line graph that is evident thanks to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers had taken as their own, and so if you are looking for proof of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 mi) into the land from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
Although the forests are not just mangrove swamps—they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km², of which about two-thirds is covered by water/wetland areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and almost 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave from the inter-district station (near the river) during the day, although the majority, particularly those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the interdistrict buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese vans, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge was scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian cells were awaiting completion.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formally called "The giant province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish had begun the colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain many indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Other times of the year, you can also see tournaments and smaller matches here.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank of the islands, which is located in Stanley, directly opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the island, and in Stanley they also accept credit cards and US dollars.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards might not be accepted, while British and United States currencies are taken; check in advance with the owners to determine what method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed +30°C.
Winter, although it may not seem like it, can be cold: every now and then temperatures can drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There aren't seasons that are particularly "rainy" or "dry": the amount of water remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the fauna is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other animals!
No matter how tame they may seem, bison, badgers, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Furthermore, you should know that food smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying cooked food with strong smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the famous naval standoff of 1889 when seven ships coming from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships had been sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is halfway between two harbors. The most famous ones are found in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the Northern Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches safe for swimming, and pohutukawa trees often provide shade.
The marinas of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are beaches for families, often very crowded, with luxury boutiques on the seafront. It is safe to swim.
The main beer of the area is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's easy to drink and refreshing. The other beer from the area is called "Manta".
There are a lot of French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local water from the pitcher is safe and perfect to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a "long black" coffee is strange. A short black is an "espresso", they fill the cappuccino with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on par with that of Belgium. The future juices are expensive but very good.
Many tours around the coral reef take place throughout the year, and disturbances to the coral reef due to one of these causes are rare.
However, keep in mind the advice of the authorities, obey all the signs, and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
The box jellyfish stings near the shores and river estuaries from October to April of 1770 past. Occasionally they can be found outside of this time.
Sharks are present, but it is rare for them to attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary natural habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance removes the worry from the traveler of having a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents are often in agreement with specific hotels, while it should be possible for them to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Usually, agencies offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined travel/hotel packages.
They can even hold the reservation if you need time to think about the offer and if you need time for the documents for your destination (e.g. the visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed to the travel agent in advance, not directly to the hotel, please.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those who participate in music festivals decide to camp there, and most of those who participate consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to go early to find a spot where you can settle near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages might be finished, there could be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are sailing in the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of your cabin, because passing through the ice floes causes a rather horrible sound for those who suffer from seasickness the most.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the terms).
Casinos in general make great efforts to make customers spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment, to keep regular customers happy and inside the venue.
Some bars offer free drinks at the counter. In any case, drunkenness makes you lose your mind, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over mountain ridges should consider the possibility of snow, hail, and very low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During the snow seasons, in a short time enough snow can fall to block you in.
Visibility may be limited by falling or blowing snow, condensation, or fogging of the car windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic mostly continues without interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most interesting moment for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to a trip on the mainland to see the charm of African fauna, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and the standard equipment will allow you to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "walk in the bush," "safari excursion," or simply "walking") consists of hiking, lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might find yourself in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies are changing, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is predicted that the majority of tickets for the events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing clothes can help them dry. Many hotels lend out the iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If there isn't a plant or you don't feel like putting in planted bets, you can try using a handkerchief, if there is one.
Be careful not to let the cloth get too hot (as it could shrink it or, in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others several minutes are needed.
The filters change in effect, and if you should have any doubts, you should consider buying water in a well-sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter parasitic animals that are unfamiliar to them in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritations, or, in the worst case, cause allergies, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force usually do not present themselves as parasites.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in specific locations.
Travelers going directly to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most treacherous driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated wooded areas.
If you're not experienced driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: they're all steep uphill climbs, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
He knows that the established speed limits, which are lower than in the sections before and after — generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and the rigorous respect for them, is even more important than the opposite.
It's curious, though, that the mobile phone service here is much stronger than in many other stretches of the journey, for example, the wildlands of Pennsylvania.
German sweets are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit desserts are common, with baked apple desserts available year-round, and cherry and plum desserts appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich sweets, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.

The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from both sides of the saddle.
They provide more stability to someone riding pillion, but there can be safety problems caused by the possibility that the person's feet get stuck.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, the horse running away could drag him. To minimize this risk, some safety measures can be adopted.
Firstly, most of the riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, slightly tight sole.
Afterward, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow a flap of leather to come away from a saddle if a falling rider pulls it from behind.

Winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain on skis or a board attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the travel activities with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: the rock paintings that show skiers are from 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed for at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski association was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, alpine skiing, or ski touring.
It has things to see, but usually it doesn't include tours with skis in an alpinism style or going across the mountains, the latter done on steep terrains and which require skis or much tougher boots.
Think of ski routes as similar to hiking routes.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover significantly longer distances than walking - but only rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack on prepared trails.
Europe is a rather small continent but with many independent countries. As a rule, traveling between several countries would mean having to go through visa requirements and passport control more than once.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a country in this sense.
As long as you stay in this area, in general you can cross the borders without going back through passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which manifestos are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the antiquity limit can be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products could be defined as antiques, even though they are more recent than mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important means of sustenance among the Sámi, and the culture that revolves around the trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in reindeer herding at a high level, but they lived off fishing, hunting and such, keeping the reindeer mostly as draught animals.
Today many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.

A course like this will address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course as a standard usually lasts 2-5 days and should include role-playing games, basic first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the wild are known, but publications that deal with war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to allow passports with unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to reflect a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents in the same way can change a lot.
Even the checks at security controls became much more thorough in the era after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not have to wait to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being respected.
Rip currents are the flow of waves that return and collide with the sea, often a coral reef or something similar.
Regarding the submarine topography, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas, and there a sudden current can form towards the deep water.
Most deaths are due to the effort of those who try to swim against the current, which could be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming afterwards is no more difficult than normal.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be captured or, according to your abilities and if they have noted you, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock hits before culture shock (less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture sometimes struggle to readjust to their culture of origin.
When you return home after having lived abroad, you have become accustomed to the new culture and have lost some of the customs of your own culture.
When you go abroad for the first time, people are probably patient and understanding because they know that travelers have to get used to a new place.
People wouldn't be able to understand that patience and understanding are necessary even for travelers returning home.
The light and sound show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the spectacle begins.

The scenes are shown in the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and hold a good portion of the bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula blend with the plain, then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the maximum at Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used for navigation at sea, including recreational navigation, and also for expeditions that have needs for remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
A increasingly popular option for those considering a gap year is to travel and study.
This is most popular among those leaving school, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their education.

There is usually a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful place for boats. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, both inside the lakes and along the coasts of the archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, it is not necessary to have a yacht.
While it's true that archipelagos and lakes are large enough for yachts, smaller boats or even canoes offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same is true for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but for the rest it is truly unique (for example, in Holland the figure is one in forty).
A good portion of the various Baltic cruises include a long stop in Saint Petersburg, in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historical city for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on excursions by boat, you won't need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, in Germany, in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin has no sea nearby and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is of great importance for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
In some areas, the larger companies have their own airplanes, but for other areas and smaller businesses it was a problem.
If things were sent by air transport, in some stretches it would take days to pass unloading and customs.
The only way to get him across quickly was to send him as luggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The best way to be able to fly first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, to convince your company to do it for you).
Believe me, this thing is not cheap: most of the time, you end up having to pay up to four times the normal cheap fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Most of the time, it's not even worth looking for discounts for business class or first class when you have to fly from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there's a group of travelers who want to pay the maximum to be able to go to a place quickly and comfortably, and they take advantage of it.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

While this is often just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get along with Parisians is always to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is "well-bred" (well-raised). It will make it much easier to get around.
The sudden aloofness of the Parisians will quickly evaporate if you show some basic cordiality.

Pre-modern observatories are out of use today, and remain as museums or places of education.
Since light pollution in their golden age was not the kind of problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are very large structures in areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing the cherry blossom in bloom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the flower of the emperor.
