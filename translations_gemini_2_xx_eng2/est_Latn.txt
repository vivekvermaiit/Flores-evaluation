Besides proving that at least some dinosaurs had feathers – an already widespread theory – it allows us to see details not usually visible in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown, and its underside was light or yellowish-red.
The discovery allows us to take a look at the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a developed quill, which is called a rachis, but they possess other feather parts – a rachis and a plumulaceous base of the vane –, scientists concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than the other parts.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggested that the specimen is an example of adult plumage, not downy feathers of a hatchling, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur.
Researchers hypothesized that although it is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult plumage, not chick down.
Yesterday morning in Turkey, a car bomb detonated at the Gaziantep police headquarters, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy exists as a halo around the galaxy and is composed of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a technology-free experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed paper with the name of their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The procedural rules of the French electoral law are quite strictly formalized in the laws.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes in the box at the beginning of voting and that no other envelopes are added to it except those that have been duly accounted for and added to it by eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific instructions.

Police Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
When the car hit the house, there were three people inside, but none of them were injured.
The driver sustained serious head injuries, though.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed until the rescue services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused in Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering his son.
He has been taken into custody until the indictment and court hearing, but any eyewitness testimonies may be of questionable value because his picture has been published in many places.
Elsewhere in Great Britain, this is common practice, but Scotland has a different justice system, and the courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when publishing photos of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until a charge is brought.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants it to be based on the border that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a guaranteed military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow the military to remain for only five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control trial were strictly monitored by forest rangers, as the trial was under surveillance and its effectiveness was being assessed.
In collaboration with the NPWS and an affiliate of the Australian Clay Target Association (NSW), qualified volunteer shooters were recruited under the shooters association's game shooting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Director of Conservation and Cultural Heritage at NPWS Park, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received thorough safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member interim electoral council yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the president's commission recommended the resignation of the previous acting president as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
In some places, the trigger for violent protests was the failure to organize elections, some of which had been expected since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of iPod malfunction due to overheating have been reported, which have collectively caused six fires and resulted in minor burns to four people.
According to Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), there were 27 accident reports involving the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
In response, the ministry called Apple's report delay "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday evening).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an old woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was neutralized by gunfire.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied to be an obstetrician and started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature birth in his free time.
Her studies showed that administering a certain hormone to the fetus accelerates the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Even Luna's wrestling colleagues paid their respects.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the original queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of the double moon. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and miss her... hopefully she is in a better place now."
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of survey participants agree, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the results, 29% of those surveyed think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his readiness is in doubt due to complaints.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs to overcome the pain, as they are banned at the Olympics.
On January 25th, mathematician and Central Missouri University computer science professor Curtis Cooper discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets supplied the Earth with water, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, given that comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed the same-sex marriage legalization law.
He called the rumors political lobbying and nonsense.
It is speculated that he/she will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Instead of older land-based radar technology, it uses satellite-based technology, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the locations of aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
Additional transport will not be provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Furthermore, there are no overground car parks or "park and ride" facilities.
Fearing a lack of transportation, the possibility was raised that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands, which belong to Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer. An endemic medium ground finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant large cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, interbred.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into thin wire that can be twisted or braided. It can be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books, which were called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make your own indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) a chemical is.
pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H is the symbol for hydrogen in pH) present in the chemical being studied.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then squeeze it into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture of your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a funny feeling and forming almost a shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in Crete, in the houses of Minoan culture cities, and in Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were mixed.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts light and the view.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important change the wheel has brought us is significantly easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to this, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them on the scale are medium-sized felines, whose diet consists of medium-sized prey, starting with rabbits and ending with antelopes and goats.
Finally, there are many small felines (including stray domestic cats) that eat significantly more small prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept, a specific task that each cat does, which prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups, or prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and pups.
Females are usually very closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in many ways like wolf and dog packs – animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a versatile athlete, can climb (though not well), swim, cover great distances by jumping, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers belong to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four felines can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's loud roar, but rather like a sentence of growlingly shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible. Almost all of the animals that an ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than itself.
According to scientists, spotted seals track and find prey (victims) by scent, sniffing places where they have been.
Their night vision is excellent, and they move very stealthily. The ocelot blends into its surroundings to hunt prey and then pounces on it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, they move across a mountain range or a river, or colonize a new island, and returning is not easy), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In a new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics than before and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adjustments as before.
As time passes, as a new population adapts to its new environment, they look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
In his elongated jaws were over 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to extra teeth on the roof of his mouth, meaning that nothing that crossed his path escaped.
It is not known for sure, but mosasaurs may have had forked tongues. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may even have been cannibals.
He also attacked everyone who went into the water, even a gigantic dinosaur like a T-Rex would be no match for him.
While much of their diet would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men preferred banquets where they ate reclining and resting.
Ancient Roman food could not contain ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and priests cared for the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests may enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The tower's peak was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
The Jewish family conducted most of their life activities outdoors.
The women cooked outside; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, which is why wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian-like, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there was a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is located upside down at the bottom edge of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early years, the large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ by 24 ½ inches) was stored rolled up.
Thus, it's likely that the tag was simply added as a label.
D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
Vichy French ruled there. They were people from France who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, an action that became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and liberated French forces had freed southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, or a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "of a citizen," which is related to the Latin words civis, "citizen," and civitas, meaning "city or city-state," and this to some extent also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of states. Civilizational culture means the transmission of knowledge over generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and sufficient cultural diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress as its sole component.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and lacking a national executive or judiciary, it relied on the authority of the states to enact all laws, which were often not very cooperative.
Nor did he have the power to repeal tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is one of the most successful teams in the world, and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in them internationally and at the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the Japanese archipelago, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan was already mentioned in the 15th century when European sailors sailing past wrote down the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) brought the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan under their control, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding the governing rights of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures – namely, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions were inherited by the dimensions of digital camera image sensors.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm tall.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing both numbers by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore believed to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format group) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
Often exploited and frequently ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
According to this, the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines, dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be carefully monitored.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united the nations of Europe, despite the differences in their languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are intended precisely for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the center of ecclesiastical power had been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being adhered to.
Soon after the start of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective – it cut off vital supplies to the military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which has been enshrined in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since this tactic was not followed by a special reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a large part of the citizens and peoples were pacifistically and isolationistically minded.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his last job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each stage of Chinese history or each ruling family had a separate dynasty.
There was also an era of unstable divided provinces between each dynasty. The best known of these eras was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce fighting took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history – thousands of people died in internal conflicts as they hoped to gain the highest position of power in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not an autocrat.
Even after the Revolution, fields of activity were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applied to the military, as instead of military ranks being based on class, they were now based on military merit.
The French Revolution also inspired representatives of the oppressed working class in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad felt a great interest in things deeper than secular life. He had a habit of often going to meditate in a cave on Mount Noori ('light'), which became known as Hira.
The cave, which has survived the ages, provides a vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, located on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you knew it existed. Once you're in the cave, it's completely isolated.
There is nothing to see except for the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of the world reaches or is visible inside the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many giant pyramid structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "bow up" mark resembles the letter V, and the "bow down" mark resembles a bracket or a square with the bottom side missing.
"Up" means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and "down" means you should start at the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow stroke creates a softer sound, while a down-bow stroke is stronger and more powerful.
Feel free to write down your markings, but keep in mind that the printed articulations are there for a musical reason and should therefore be respected.
The terrified Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of Parisian market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob that shouted and screamed threats towards the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a murdered royal guard in front of the horrified queen at Versailles.
The Filipinos themselves paid for the war expenses of the US imperialism conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover the expenses, in the name of the Philippine government, of expenditures and bond interest channeled through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the super-profits earned from the long-term exploitation of the Philippine people constituted the elementary profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that motivated the order's creation.
The era in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, and it was a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is conventionally considered to be the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept encompassing various ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to the firm conviction that human destiny is governed by the logic associated with the laws of science and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely culturally or politically unaffected, and that technology itself has an impact on society that is inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the existence of motor vehicles definitely necessitates the development of roads.
However, a domestic road network is not economically viable with only a few cars, which is why efforts are being made to develop new production methods to reduce the cost associated with car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
An important aspect of Romanticism was cultural determinism, which drew on writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the society's location, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a place where all luxuries converged began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century mainly because the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were more valuable than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture characteristic of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by nearly 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most notable developments of that era, stemming from the Crusades, was that people began using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture in which food is produced in quantities sufficient only to meet the needs of the agricultural producer and their family.
Natural agriculture is a simple, often nature-friendly system where seeds from that ecological region, crop rotation, or other relatively simple methods are used to increase yields.
Historically, most peasants engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with similar ideas who feel that societal standards do not apply to them, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Characteristics that allow a subculture to be distinguished can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a mixture of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the use of a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to pay attention to those few unfortunate cases where adults failed to socialize children during their upbringing due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called feral or wild. People (often their parents) have kept feral children confined; in some cases, parents abandoned the child due to a severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If a child is raised entirely by an animal, the feral child behaves (within physical limitations) almost exactly like the animal that raised them, for example, they fear or are indifferent to humans.
Although project-based learning should simplify acquisition and make it more interesting, the educational scaffolding approach is a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a way to support people who are acquiring a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, or in other words, support can be both a teacher and Microsoft Office's little paperclip character.
Virtual steps are integrated into the software with the aim of questioning, referencing, and explaining procedures that may be too complicated for the student to manage alone.
Children are taken to orphanages for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We find that the foster care system represents a safe zone for these children.
The goal of our foster family system is to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The foster family should provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet bring additional dimensions from the standpoint of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are highlighted as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as newly motivating aspects when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, or facial movements lasting only milliseconds.
Primarily, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately identify sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior exist in animals as well, for example, in domesticated dogs.
Studies conducted in the twentieth century have shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
With isolation and recombination, diversity in each generation fluctuates back and forth between two pools.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs with the available plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant-based sources would have been proteins in leafy greens and vegetables, but for primates like us, these are easy to digest only when cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
Taking all of this into account, we shouldn't be surprised that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep disturbance is the process of purposefully waking up during a normal sleep period and falling asleep again after a short time (10–60 minutes).
It's simple if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you find that you turn off your alarm clock while still asleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or known diuretic teas) before bedtime to force yourself to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive the life force present. It is possible for every person to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to reaching this goal is tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana path of love and various Indian yoga techniques.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened in Kundalini Yoga.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the countries fell out due to clashes of systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
This was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and proxy armies were actually supposed to fight on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup via the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans failed almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the conquest of Poland's eastern territories, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
Using ships for transporting goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, navies have had the task of ensuring that a state can move people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the more notable recent examples of this was the World War II North Atlantic campaign, in which the Americans tried to get men and materials across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain like the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were originally domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to gain easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds, which grazed on hills or other pastures, and were often herded by goat herders who were children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted of merely parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger quantities than on the somewhat bumpy roads that existed at the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early on to hold the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that rails are more effective if they have iron strips on them.
This became a standard method, but the iron wore out the wooden wheels of the wagons more.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking — Homo erectus started walking upright two million years ago.
For their ancestor, the australopithecus, walking upright was not habitual.
Examples of specialization in bipedalism can be found in australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can start living more environmentally friendly lives, join environmental movements, and even become activists.
Often, this is exactly like treating symptoms. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and neutralize it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to mankind's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have grown bigger due to overpopulation and mankind's wasteful lifestyle.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, the manuscript of the bill, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, which are now known as Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon conducted the first public reading of the document on July 8th at Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy of it reached London on August 10.
The 25 copies made by Dunlap are the oldest surviving copies of the declaration. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have several characteristics that look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled and clawed feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in binary format.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or - in computer slang - bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general and do not allow for immediate diagnosis.
A clear sign of ingested or drunk poison may be an open medicine package or poisonous household chemicals nearby.
Refer to the label for specific first aid instructions regarding the poison.
Entomologists officially use the term "cimicids" for this group of insects.
This term comes from a long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, which are extremely well-adapted to living on humans as parasites.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in nests or the host's dwelling.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease affecting the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research found that MS is twice as likely to occur in women than in men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or the child's best interests.
These couples may choose to give their child up for adoption.
During adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method is the basis for most scientific research.
However, scientific research is not guided only by experimentation – an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses – but also by asking questions and observing.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's scientific, including psychological, views were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek dwindled, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Several observable rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on endogenous cycles and their creation through biological clocks.
The occurrence of periodic rhythms that are not simply a reaction to external periodic factors has been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillatory system that continues with its free-running cycle even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence indicating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children; mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites to enjoy the views and also wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting Bornean orangutans, photographing them, and learning about them.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to work, and they are in turn passed by others whose workplace is located where they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everything is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science has now shown that this massive CO2-producing economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has been favorable to human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints of that level about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate complaints about daily failures? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, traffic flow research is complex because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so traffic flows tend to be somewhat reasonably consistent and can be broadly represented mathematically.
To better describe traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections contribute to the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to move by air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies much more easily and find food and a mate much more efficiently.
Most insects are able to fold their wings against their body.
This gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that are unable to fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite – the solar system, together with the Sun (and even other stars), moved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, since you can't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide in some places.
20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the size of the Giza pyramids or the technical knowledge of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious services.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can be found naturally in nature and are relatively easy to mine with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything is formed from a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order) – solid, liquid, gas, and plasma – although he also speculated that they form new substances that we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil, when it was first introduced, was a good friend to many.
The importance and use of the pencil has decreased, as unfortunately newer writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to use a sharpener.
One can only speculate what will happen to the keyboard when something new emerges.
A nuclear bomb works on the principle of taking energy to bring together many protons and neutrons into an atomic nucleus.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the atom again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with a small nudge or spontaneously.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the back side.
It is thinner under warm seas and thicker under highlands.
There might be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Achievement motivation theories attempt to understand what motivates people to act and what they enjoy.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted during the process of maturing into adulthood.
These theories address what makes certain people want the things they do, and what environmental factors cause these people to do certain things or not do them.
Two of the most popular needs-based theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
When managers start managing their former peers, it can generally elicit two kinds of behavior. One extreme of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the boys (or girls)."
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, discipline others, conduct evaluations, assign duties, and delegate responsibility to employees.
On the other end of the spectrum is the person who changes beyond recognition, feeling that they must change everything the team has done so far and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often causes disagreements between managers and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same high standards as traditional teams, but there are still some slight differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for their immediate real-world group.
They usually have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The so-called invisible team is the administrative team to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
What reason would a company have to undertake the time-consuming task of creating a learning organization? One of the goals of involving business learning concepts in activities is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across functional departments throughout the organization, creativity and resourcefulness begin to emerge.
As a result, the company's collaboration to overcome the obstacle may lead to a new, ingenious process that meets the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, the management must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help companies reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data presents physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus, it delimits the field of study and makes it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports researchers' studies.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provided us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us better understand the processes taking place in our brains.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, forms of AI are a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves automating machines to solve tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include verification, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on finding solutions for real-world problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields, and they are also built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every class. Teachers often like to take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution to this through virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a tour virtually is also a great way to document a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a webpage each year about their trip to the state capital. The webpage is redesigned every year, but old versions are kept as keepsakes.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. However, while students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger is trying to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
"Also, "blogging forces students to get to know the world around them better." Capturing the attention of readers encourages students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can determine their position in relation to the writings of others, and provide an overview of their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital, boasting a wide array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north extends Muskoka, with the untouched natural beauty of the areas beyond.
All of the above and more highlights Ontario as characteristic of Canada for foreigners.
Further north, large areas are sparsely populated and, in places, consist of almost uninhabited wilderness.
In a surprising population comparison: the United States has a larger African American population than Canada has citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of fauna, practically a continent of its own.
Most smaller islands are independent countries or have ties to France, and they are known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became very popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: female travelers, regardless of marital status, are advised to say they are married.
It also helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, something might be done that they consider harassment, and stalking, grabbing hands, etc., are not uncommon.
Firmly say no to men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. Phoenicians, Romans, and Maronites used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badyana, and Spanish merchants, who established trading centers there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather products, hookahs, and a whole range of various gadgets, but it's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched in advance and the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province should be understood.
The city also serves as a base for ascending Mount Nyiragongo, and additionally offers the most affordable opportunities for tracking mountain gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
In conjunction with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Timbuktu is an impoverished city, even though its fame makes it a sight to see and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat from encroaching desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, "Africa's Great Civilizations".
Compared to other cities in the country, it is completely different, as it has more of an Arabic than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border in the east, Zimbabwe lies to the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park's area is 19,500 km², and it is divided into 14 different ecological regions, each of which supports a different type of wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, daily conservation and entrance fees also apply in this park.
It can also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to certain South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is a place that many tourists consider a primary attraction.
Hong Kong's skyline, a row of buildings, has been likened to sparkling bar graphs reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite it.
A large portion of Hong Kong Island's urban development projects are densely located along the northern coast.
This is a place that British colonizers took for themselves. Therefore, it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial era.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans are a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps, however; they include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The area of Sundarbans is 3850 km², of which about one third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has also been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that around 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer currently live in the area.
Buses depart from the inner city bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
As buses between city districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a couple of days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two 3.5 meter wide lanes.
The bridge's clearance height is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to plans, the bridge will be fully opened for operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani indigenous people were the most notable group of native people who inhabited the areas of present-day Eastern Paraguay and lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle as hunters, also practicing agriculture for subsistence.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous people, a territory previously known as the Giant Province of the Indies.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character.
It is well known that Argentinian water polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The year's biggest tournament will take place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and polo match ticket information, see the Asociación Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at a value of 1:1.
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although British and American currency may be; check with the owners beforehand to determine a suitable payment method.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is nearly impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30 °C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity together create a colder feeling than what the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct wet or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, it is still wildlife and should not be disturbed.
Park authorities say to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how calm they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they did not keep a safe distance. These are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals, so give them the space they need.
You should also be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The infamous 1889 harbor blockade took place in the port, where seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except for one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement-led struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland is surrounded by two harbours, it has many beaches. The most popular of these are located in three regions.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay (in the north) to Devonport (in the south).
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most of them offer shade from tall ironwood trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the elite suburbs of Mission Bay, and in St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are sometimes overcrowded beaches intended for family holidays, lined with a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One, which doesn't have a complex flavor, but is pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called Manta.
There may be many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be more suitable for travel.
Local tap water is perfectly suitable for drinking, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, "flat white" coffee is a foreign concept. "Short black" is espresso, but cappuccino is served with a heap of cream (not foam), and tea is offered without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips are made to the coral reef throughout the year, and it is rare for any of them to cause damage to the coral reef.
However, listen to the authorities, follow all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and estuaries north of the town of 1770 from October to April. They can occasionally be found outside of this period as well.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live entirely in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also find other accommodation options, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your booking if you want to think over the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests should be discussed with the tour operator first, not directly with the hotel.
For some music festivals, the majority of participants decide to camp on site and consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the hustle and bustle, you need to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
Keep in mind that even though the main stages may no longer be playing music, there may be other stages at the festival where music is played until late into the night.
Some festivals have special campgrounds designed for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check where your cabin is located, as passage through ice creates quite a loud noise for nearby cabins.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually struggle to keep guests there as long as possible and spend as much money as possible. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and prevent them from leaving.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, being drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know that it's important to stay sober.
Anyone travelling at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you can't drive the same way as you would on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a short time to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues mostly steadily throughout the year.
Africa's biggest tourist attraction is probably safaris, which are the highlight of the trip for many visitors.
The popular term "safari" refers to overland journeys with the aim of discovering African wildlife, especially in savannas.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, come close to the cars, and standard equipment is sufficient to observe them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and easier to see with binoculars.
A walking safari (also referred to in English as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts for a couple of hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies no longer extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to take place.
Presumably, most ticket prices will range from ¥2500 to ¥130000, with standard tickets costing around ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if it is not in your room.
If you don't have an iron handy, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different methods for purifying water, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others it needs to be done for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reliable manufacturer in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter pests that are not found in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through landscapes with isolated thickets of forest.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, drive carefully: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sudden turns are common.
Speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – typically 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and adhering to them strictly is even more important than usual.
Strangely, the mobile service here is much stronger than in many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and diverse, resembling those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked into the pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you're looking for a hearty, rich baked good, try a pastry known as a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be dry or liquid, depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the peninsula, coconut milk is generally used.
Indonesian cuisine is a general term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country, allowing you to choose from 17,000 islands.
However, when used without further qualifications, the term tends to refer to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, widely available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes, with peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices being the favorite flavorings of the Javanese.
Stirrups, hanging on either side of the saddle, are meant to support the rider's feet.
These help the rider maintain better balance, but they can be dangerous because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot remains trapped in the stirrup, it can happen that the horse may drag them along while running away. Precautions should be taken to reduce this danger.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backwards.
The Cochamo Valley, a premier climbing destination in Chile known as the "Yosemite of South America," features a variety of granite big walls and rock formations.
Breathtaking views open up from the peaks of the mountain ridges. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes on these cliffs with endless potential.
Alpine snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow-covered surface on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity among many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski-bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in one particular location.
Skiing is very old – skiers are depicted in cave drawings from as far back as 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport was practiced as early as the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to downhill skiing or mountaineering but does not usually include them. Downhill skiing or mountaineering is usually done on steeply sloped terrain, and they require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover somewhat greater distances than walking, but despite the groomed trails, you will very rarely achieve a cross-country skiing speed comparable to skiing without a backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, yet it has many independent countries. Usually, traveling through several countries means having to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
But in this matter, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can essentially cross borders without going through passport control points again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member state, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are over 100 years old.
The definition varies in different geographical regions; for example, in places like North America, the age limit may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be called antiques, even though they are not as old as similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for many Sami people, and the culture associated with trading is also important for representatives of many other professions.
But even traditionally, not all Sami were engaged in extensive reindeer herding, but rather lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people work in modern commerce. In the Sami region of Lapland, tourism is a significant source of income.
Although the word "mustlane" (gypsy) is widely used, especially by those who are not Roma, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma ethnicity.
If there are travel advisories in place for the country you are visiting, this may affect your travel health insurance or travel disruption insurance.
Perhaps you'd prefer to consult with a different government instead of your own, but their advice is intended for the citizens there.
As one example, American citizens may face different situations in the Middle East compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A country's travel advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in that country.
The views presented are often superficial, generalized, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous meteorological phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of them, which may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are extreme weather phenomena, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and dust devils.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all the dangers of severe weather conditions affecting the area, as this may impact travel plans.
Anyone planning a trip to a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for "hostile environment course" will likely yield the address of a local business.
The course usually addresses the problems discussed here in much greater detail, typically with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 3–5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about the sustainability of wild nature are common, but publications about war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender marker (X), or to update documents to reflect a preferred name or gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents also varies greatly.
Security screenings at checkpoints have become much more thorough since September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transsexuals should not assume they will pass through security checks without their privacy and dignity being affected.
In rip currents, the water flow bounces back from the shore, often due to a reef or something similar.
Due to underwater landforms, the returning water flow moves to a couple of deeper spots, and there a fast current can form, heading into the deep waters.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from swimming against the current, as it can be an impossible task.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to move somewhere where it won't pull you back in again, or if you don't have enough skill and have been noticed, you can wait for the rescue team.
Reverse culture shock hits earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their local culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and also lost some of the habits of your home culture.
Initially, people were likely patient and understanding with newcomers from abroad, knowing that travelers needed time to adjust to a new country.
People may not anticipate that travelers returning home may need patience and understanding.
For children, the pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area.
Before the performance starts, you will see the pyramids in the dark and be able to observe them in silence.
Usually, the voices of tourists and traders can always be heard. Sound and light tell a story just like a storybook.
The Sphinx has become the backdrop for spectacle and the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated with lights.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several countries and host the largest number of bases – 16 active bases as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano forms a remarkable natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region of Antarctica lying west of the base of the Antarctic Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merge into a plateau, then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
Located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in Antarctica — the Vinson Massif — the highest point of which is Mount Vinson, at 4,892 m.
In remote locations where there is no mobile network coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone doesn't typically replace a mobile phone because you need to be outside, in an unobstructed line of sight with the satellite, to make a phone call.
The service is often used by shipping, including pleasure boats, but also expeditions that require remote data and voice.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
A growingly popular option for gap year planners is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before university without it negatively affecting their education.
In many cases, taking courses abroad during a gap year can improve your chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
These educational programs generally require tuition fees for enrollment.
Finland is a great destination for boating. This so-called land of a thousand lakes also has a thousand islands, located both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to travel between the islands and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different kind of experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland; there is one boat for every seven to eight people.
Comparable figures can be found in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is a unique phenomenon (e.g., in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty).
Most various Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you have a couple of full days to visit the historic city, while being able to return to the ship for the night and sleep there.
If you only go ashore on ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some travel brochures highlight the German city of Berlin. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located anywhere near the sea, and visiting this city is not included in the price of the travel package.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it's their first flight or they have had traumatic incidents in the past.
There's no need to be ashamed of it; it's no different from personal fears and aversions to other things that many people experience.
For some, understanding the working principles of aircraft and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on ignorance or lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well for the fast delivery of packages. Time is often very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Some routes are served by large companies with their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had problems.
When goods were shipped by air, unloading and customs clearance could take days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as registered baggage. Airline rules don't allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, that's where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class is to shell out a large pile of money for that luxury (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
But it's not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times more for business class and 11 times more for first class than for regular economy class!
Generally, it's not even worth looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know very well that there is a group of flyers willing to pay a large sum of money for the luxury of flying somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge a corresponding price for it.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict in eastern Moldova led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between the two parts of Moldova, despite the failures in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city with a population of nearly 3.7 million, it is home to the second-largest port after Istanbul, and it is a very good transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center situated on a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-brick roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and it is also home to a rare octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble dove sculptures above some of the graves.
It's worth taking half an hour of your time to wander around this interesting city.
To the north lies the easily accessible, romantic, and charming small town of Sintra, which became known among foreigners after Lord Byron brilliantly described its charms.
Scotturb bus number 403 frequently travels to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca along the way.
North of the village, also visit the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, which is world-famous as a site of apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, and that this place has almost priceless significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
Even today, there are still men and women alive who survived their time here, and even more who had loved ones killed or worked to death here, whether they were Jewish or not.
Treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching its structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because according to the law it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
In the metro, announcements are regularly broadcast only in Catalan, but an automated system announces unplanned disruptions in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
A common belief is that Parisians are self-centered, arrogant, and full of themselves.
Although it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave as politely as possible, conducting yourself like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This makes getting around significantly easier.
The Parisians' boorish attitude quickly disappears if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in dense forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, and a mix of montane and Mediterranean vegetation grows there.
Thanks to its diverse microclimates, soils, and altitudes, there is a remarkably wide variety of plant species.
The area is also home to an extremely diverse collection of animal and bird species.
Besides many common species, you can also find rare animals here, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries do offer wraps for unprepared women, but if you have something with you, especially if it's brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can also be rented at the entrance, but the garment is not washed after every user, so wearing these skirts may not be pleasant. As for men, one size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like similar Mediterranean foods, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses a lot of olive oil.
Especially in summer, a simple and beloved dinner is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and other available toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie ('you'), always start with a capital letter, even when they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between a verb and an object.
Allegedly, this makes reading easier, although writing is more complicated again, as it is necessary to figure out whether a verb or an adjective is being used as a noun.
In Italian, pronunciation is quite simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means "expensive/dear," but carro means "cart/carriage."
Persian grammar is relatively simple and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.

Although people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that there is no need to learn it separately.
Pre-telescopic observatories are usually obsolete nowadays and remain in use as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem during their heyday as it is now, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern scientific telescopes are enormous installations in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea originates from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
The first cherry blossom viewing parties in Japan were hosted by the emperor and were intended only for him and other aristocrats of the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural habitat, so resist the urge to take even "just one" specimen with you.
If you visit a formally designed garden, you will be unceremoniously thrown out for picking a "sample".
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, and it's very easy to navigate, plus you can buy almost anything there after you arrive.
However, being located just a couple of degrees north of the equator at the so-called high tropical latitudes, you have to cope with both heat (all the time) and strong solar radiation (when the sky is clear, which is less frequent).
Some buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Several traditions of this holiday have also been adopted by non-religious people in Christian countries and by non-Christians worldwide.
It is a tradition to spend Easter night awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigil services on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with congregations often going into celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island got here by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Because it is a long distance to the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, which is why giant tortoises are the primary herbivores on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark almost around the clock.
Because these areas are sparsely populated and therefore rarely experience light pollution, it is also possible to enjoy the stars there.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are standard work attire, and colleagues address each other by surnames or job titles.
Workplace harmony is essential, and it emphasizes team efforts rather than glorifying individual achievements.
Employees often need to get their supervisor's approval before making any decision and must follow the supervisor's instructions without question.
