Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that was already widespread, but it also provides details that fossils are not usually able to provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's feather color was chestnut-brown on top with a pale carotenoid hue on the bottom.
The finding also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a developed rachis, called a barb, but do have other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers have concluded that the barb was likely a later evolutionary development than the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of a mature animal and not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
A car bomb that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

The amount of light and the rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for will be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational force on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory posits that most of the dark matter in a galaxy's vicinity is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and it is composed of many small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech affair: voters seclude themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed slip of paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify their identity, the voter deposits the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
French election laws regulate the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there were no envelopes in the ballot box before the start of voting and that no further envelopes are added except for those of legitimate and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to serve as witnesses at any stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, according to specific procedures.

Her first event was the slalom, where she earned a Did Not Finish in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place finisher, Claudia Loesch of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place finisher, Gyongyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers from the Yeshiva team failed to complete their runs, and 45 out of 117 total skiers in the giant slalom failed to achieve a ranking in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arieh said, we arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman, and we found her phone and laptop.
The defendants are named Baba Kanjar, Butha Kanjar, Rampru Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adequah has since appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court and been charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting conviction and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be flawed since her picture has been widely publicized.
This is common practice everywhere else in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently, and courts have viewed publishing photos as something that could cause bias.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists do appear to be willing to take risks if they publish images of suspects, etc.
The legal department, responsible for all claims, informed reporters that no further comment will be given, at least until a conviction.
The document, according to the leak, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
According to reports, other issues discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to such a presence for only five years.
It has been determined that the shooters in the additional pest control experiment must be under the close supervision of foresters, as the experiment is under supervision and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
"In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Co Ltd, accredited volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters' Association's hunting program."
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting manager of the NPWS Conservation and Heritage Park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting trial received comprehensive safety instructions and guidance.
Martelly swore in yesterday a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Council recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, erupted due to the failure to hold elections that were supposed to take place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods that overheated were reported, a problem that led to six fires and left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called non-serious.
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report's postponement very regrettable.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Office of Management of Emergency Situations in the Northern Mariana Islands reported that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former police officer in the Philippine police held tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
A number of hostages were rescued, and so far the deaths of at least six have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
After that, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Ligins continued in his father's path and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research the topic of premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that taking the hormone would have accelerated the fetal pulmonary development of the baby.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman.
Dustin Runnels said that Luna was a freak like me... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... Hopefully she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who responded to the 2010 Australian federal election survey, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The then-Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of the survey participants share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of participants believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness has been questioned.
He couldn't take the medications he needed to overcome his pain because they are prohibited in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water arriving on Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as gossip and political nonsense.
It is estimated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate airplanes more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No public transportation has been added and trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available in the area.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game might have to take place behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was previously thought that the process took much longer, due to hybridization between an endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) and the immigrant large cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be stretched into a thin thread, which can be spun and folded. It can be hammered or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH level of a chemical. You can make an indicator from red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen (the H in pH) in the chemicals being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, form them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and creating a kind of peel.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, nearly every house had a toilet with a flushing cistern connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then transmits it back to headquarters, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
A huge missile over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing the wheel did for us is give us much easier and faster means of transportation.
This brought us the train, the car, and many other modes of transportation.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat much larger numbers of small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a specific role that each cat fulfills, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats; they live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three adult male relatives, along with no fewer than thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in a very similar way to wolf or dog packs, animals whose behavior is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats), and like them, are particularly deadly to their prey.
Being exceptionally athletic, the tiger can climb (albeit not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the powerful roar of a lion; it is more like a sentence of words shouted impatiently.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists think that ocelots find prey and track them by smell, by sniffing the ground they walked on.
They can see excellently in the dark using night vision, and also sneak around silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations than those they needed in the past to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same accommodations they did in the past.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that they will no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, and therefore it feared nothing, except for other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and an additional set in the upper part of his mouth, meaning anyone who crossed his path had no chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have even been a cannibal.
In addition, it attacked any creature that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't stand against it.
While most of their foods were familiar to us, the Romans did have strange or unusual items for celebrations, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich liked to hold feasts together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.
It is impossible that ancient Roman meals included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, or potatoes, and also not cocoa, and no Roman from ancient times ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the god's home.
People would bring offerings to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and a sacred inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special towers in the shape of a pyramid, known as ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special temple in honor of the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not of such great importance.
Most of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, and therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas recount that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and in his voyages westward, he discovered Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each of the countries was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But even so, that's not correct. Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are written the words "The Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that in its early days, the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage purposes.
Therefore, it is likely that the marking was simply added as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
She was controlled by men from Vichy France. These were Frenchmen who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and acted alongside the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a particularly large group of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines, in a way, the size of the society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge between several generations, a cultural footprint, and relatively wide dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and do not receive recognition as actual civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government - in which Congress was the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities in the states, who often did not cooperate, to enforce its laws.
And she had no authority to bypass tax and tariff laws between countries.
The regulation required unanimous agreement from all countries before an amendment could be added, and the countries treated the central government with such levity that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with that of Germany, is the second most successful national team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international events and the Olympics.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to Japan's island group/cluster, it is often defined as an archipelago from a geographical perspective.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European sailors passing through the area documented the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, leading to a change in traditional grain cultivation practices and the employment of Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seized the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex were rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by digital camera imaging formats.
The dimensions of the 35mm format are actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) should be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been subjected to much ridicule and misuse, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in a picture.
He states that the most effective location for the main subject of the photograph is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subjected to rigorous criticism.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the countries of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
Its penetrating power influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the central beliefs in Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are specifically intended for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church resided in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to wonder if this principle was being upheld.
A short time after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved effective, blocking crucial military and civilian supplies, although this siege violated accepted international laws enshrined in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain deployed mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire regions of the ocean, creating a danger even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and countries was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horror and atrocities of World War I, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to get a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of presenting different periods of time; each stage in China's history or each family that held power was a unique dynasty.
Also, between dynasties was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these times, a fierce war raged between many nobles who fought for the crown.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not just one ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, professions were open to any man who wanted them, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This was true of the army because instead of army ranks being based on status, they were now based on ability.
In addition, the French Revolution inspired many more from the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this physical life. He would often frequent a cave known as Hira on Mount Nur (Light) to immerse himself in deep contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived throughout history, provides a very rich picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it at all, even if you know it exists. With the entrance into the cave, you are in complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family.
The upward arc symbol looks like a V, and the downward arc symbol looks like a staple or a square without its bottom side.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the פרוש (the place where the hand grips the bow) and pull the bow.
An up bow generally creates a softer sound, while a down bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own notes, but remember that the musical notes are there for a musical reason, so you should generally stick to them.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forcibly returned to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and hurling threats at the king and queen.
The masses forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At some point, a man from the mob waved the head of a royal guard soldier who was killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The costs of the American imperialist war to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses and interest on bonds transferred to the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
It is clear that the immense profits derived from the ongoing exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the fundamental gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the order's establishment.
The era in which the events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that lasted throughout the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas and practices, from technology push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is based on a logic that arises from the laws of nature and their expression in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology progresses in a way that is largely unaffected by culture or politics, and that technology has effects on societies that are inherent and not socially contingent.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for only a handful of cars, and therefore new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The abundance of private cars also increases the frequency of traffic accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of healthcare to repair bodily damage.
The Romantic movement contained a significant element of cultural determinism, inspired by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped human beings, and over time, customs and culture arose connected to that geography, and these, thanks to their harmony with the society's place, were considered superior to laws arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk fabrics and spices whose value was higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
During this period, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 12th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the clothing was deeply influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western European countries began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the period, resulting from the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is intended to produce enough food to meet the exact needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, method that uses seeds saved from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Throughout history, most farmers have engaged in agriculture for self-sufficiency, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical traits, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture typically signal their belonging through a unique and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is to learn from the unfortunate, isolated cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, did not experience socialization by adults while growing up.
Children like these are called feral children. Some feral children were confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment occurred due to the parents' refusal to accept a severe intellectual or physical disability of the child.
It is possible that feral children experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some were said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely identical to those of the animal that raised it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to facilitate learning and make it more engaging, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a learning aid that supports people undergoing a new learning experience, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real; in other words, teachers are a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and designed to ask, respond to, and explain challenging processes that students may have difficulty dealing with on their own.
Children are sent to foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child in the world deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet they do.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare services.
Foster care is meant to provide all the needs that were previously lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and access to gratification.
For example, it is argued that learning and social connections are important motivational factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and ongoing relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can identify if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech," noted how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities in analyzing human behavior are also shared by animals like domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the expressed variation pool.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation back and forth between the two pools every generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources were the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting them if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all the data, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem in roughly the same ways that chimpanzees in the savanna use today.
Sleep interruption is a process of intentionally waking up during your regular sleep time and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
It can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself repeatedly snoozing your alarm, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces the sleeper to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the available life force. Every person has the ability to achieve complete peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing separating us from our goals are our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the all-embracing path of love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through thought and visualization of various divine beings, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, the contradictions in their systems, procedures, and cultures led to conflict between the countries.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It took place over the next 40 years, with actual fighting carried out by proxy armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already broken, and the only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost irrelevant overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of navies has been to ensure that your nation maintains the ability to move its people and products, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and products.
One of the most prominent recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Simultaneously, the German navy, which primarily used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by shepherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar shepherd. These grazing methods are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Despite being constructed solely of parallel wooden beams, the wagonways allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and haul larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
The cross ties were introduced fairly early to hold the rails in place. However, it gradually became clear that the rails would be more effective if they had an iron strip on their top.
This has become standard practice, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the carts even more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as consistently as they did.
Bipedal capabilities have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 3.9 - 4.2 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can even become environmental activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is exactly like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and we must neutralize them.
It is self-evident that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and problems have intensified due to population density and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now known as Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs since they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet with claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only contain one or two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits, according to professional computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow for immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine box or open bottles of household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term stems from the age-old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that have greatly adapted to parasitic relationships with humans.
Both bat bugs and bed bugs are nest dwellers that have adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it still the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
Couples may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to pursue an adoption plan for their baby.
At the time of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can be the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
But she is not the only one - experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to disqualify one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have noticed rhythms in physiology and behavior, which often depend critically on the presence of internal cycles and their formation by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue for a period of time in regular cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading arguments for the idea that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in cells from the germline lineage can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to commute to their workplaces, passing by other people whose destination is the very place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation vehicle, everyone is, in a sense, connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now testifies that this immense carbon economy has driven the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears the same amount of complaints regarding water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems elicit such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental occurring there?
Traffic flow is a field that studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to stay within a consistent range of reason; therefore, traffic flow generally has a logical consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design, and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This fact gives them a wider range of small places where they can hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite to be true; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems logical, since we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching a width of six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows from the Earth's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The length of the central Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, no structure surpassed the pyramids at Giza in size and excellence of construction.
Ancient Egyptians from the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official media.
Italian is also an everyday language that most people who work in the country use, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, developed the theory that everything is composed of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more akin to the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also claimed that they are transformed into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table includes many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, once it came into use, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the pencil's status has declined, and its use has decreased.
People today write messages on computer screens and never need to go near a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer arrives.
A fusion bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Roughly like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Nuclear fission again releases some of that same energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they have a tendency to decay with little to no prompting.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust's thickness is approximately 70 km on the near side and approximately 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under supports and thicker under levels.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. This made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding the factor that motivates or captivates people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they mature.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to desire the things they do, and what things in their environment will cause them to do, or not do, certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when people become the managers of their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum involves trying to remain "one of the guys."
A manager of this type struggles to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, conduct performance reviews, allocate responsibility, and require people to take accountability.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes unrecognizable and feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same professional standards as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which all team members are subordinate. The invisible team sets the standards for every team member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources across an organization's functional departments are used effectively, creativity and resourcefulness can emerge.
As a result, the process of employees organizing together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that serves the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, therefore narrowing the field of research and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material needed to build simulation models, which help us understand processes in our consciousness.
Although artificial intelligence raises a strong connotation of science fiction, it constitutes a most important branch of computer science, dealing with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence includes the development of machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and time management, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, in addition to handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are usually used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. It has also been installed in several programs for home computers and computer games.
Field trips play a big role in every class. Often a teacher will be happy to take her students to places that are not possible to reach by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or marvel at beautiful art while sitting alongside their classmates.
Sharing a collaborative virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina build a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online to serve as a yearbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger is starting to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also compels students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their position in the context of others' writing, as well as outline their perspective on specific issues (Oraver, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and it boasts a variety of galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
South of there are Niagara Falls, and to the north is the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond.
All these and more highlight Ontario as being considered by foreigners to be a typical Canadian city.
Large areas north of there have a relatively sparse population, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
A comparison between populations that surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the US is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, close to the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by a wide margin, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it gained widespread traction in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the area is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every female traveler say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's also advisable to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they would see as harassment, and that it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their arm, etc.
There were instances of men being rejected aggressively, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourselves (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century BC and served the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casablanca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Bayda, and it received the name Casablanca from Spanish merchants who established trading centers there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old city, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of small items, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, far in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Goma is indeed relatively safe, but every visit outside of Goma needs to be checked in order to understand the ongoing combat situation in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The regular (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu began to serve as a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, "Africa's Great Civilizations."
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has a more Arabic than African flavor.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park spans 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological environments, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
It might also be worth purchasing a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists refer to as a main focal point.
The row of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar graph revealed by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The overwhelming majority of urban development in Hong Kong is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British settlers saw as belonging to them, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching inland nearly 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans forest has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans forest covers 3,850 square kilometers, of which about a third is covered by water areas or grass swamps.
The Sundarbans forest has served as a sanctuary for wildlife since 1966, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those headed east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts receive service via small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 Bhutanese Ngultrums) and Punakha (200 Bhutanese Ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes with a width of three and a half meters.
The minimum clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational by September 2017, at which point the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay of the 16th century, formerly called the immense Province of the Indies, was born as a result of an encounter between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a significant part of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and players, who are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year was held in December at the Las Cañitas polo grounds.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and places to purchase tickets for polo games, search the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at par to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
On the remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and United States currency may be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to determine what form of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is located south of the equator. Therefore, when it is summer there, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common there in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no defined rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains consistent throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, a distance of at least 100 yards/meters should be maintained from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals may attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These are large, wild animals that can be dangerous, so give them the space they need.
Additionally, it's worth knowing that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry fragrant substances on your body, do not cook fragrant foods, and maintain the cleanliness of the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and its population is a little less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a famous maritime dispute from 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British patrol boat. Almost 200 Germans and Englishmen lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland spans across two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour region) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitematā Harbour, in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a wonderful variety of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'; it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more resilient to travel.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but for those who are concerned, bottled mineral water is very easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of a 'flat white' coffee is unfamiliar. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino comes with lots of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many snorkeling trips depart throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of these reef hazards are rare.
Still, heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and listen carefully to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near sea coasts and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of these periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are wary of humans and will stay away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind and the assurance that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any change or request must first go through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
In many festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to sleep on-site, and most participants see this as an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages may have ended, there may still be areas in the festival that continue to play music until late into the night.
Some of the festivals offer special camping areas for families with children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as passage through ice causes quite a terrible noise in the cabins most exposed to it.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Typically, casinos make great efforts to maximize the time and money that guests spend there. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it is not easy to find the exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and ensure they don't leave the premises.
Some places offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads covered with ice and snow, friction is low, and you will not be able to drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow to get you stuck can fall in a very short amount of time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic mostly continues without disruption throughout the year.
Safari trips are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many travelers.
The popular term "safari" refers to overland journeys to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
There are animals, like elephants and giraffes, that tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow you to observe them comfortably.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, backpacking safari, or foot safari) consists of hiking on foot for several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Certain events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in trouble.
A range of cancellation policies exist, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not provide coverage up to July 2020, the date set for the Olympics.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with the majority of tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if it's not important to you to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if there is one nearby.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific dangers.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are required.
The effectiveness of different filters is not constant, and if you have concerns, perhaps you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a well-known company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them from their areas of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or in more severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are generally not defined as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers who visit countries with high taxation can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway and often passes through desolate and isolated terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns along the way.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the preceding and subsequent sections - mostly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Oddly, cell phone reception is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and diverse, similar to those in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries can be found all year round, while cherries and plums are available in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes usually pair particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called, depending on the region, a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on spices and herbs, in addition to meat or vegetables.
Curry can be dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the arid regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, if used without further descriptions, the term refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the central island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simply spiced dishes, and the prominent flavors that Javanese people love are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Knees provide support for the rider's legs, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse bolts. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders use riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Additionally, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall away from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
At the summits, there are breathtaking views from the mountain peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes within the endless potential of the rock faces.
Snow sports on slopes, including skiing and snowboarding, are a popular type of sport based on gliding down a snow-covered surface using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a central travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums, who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting people skiing were created as early as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport began at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related but does not usually involve alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is performed on steep terrain and requires much stiffer boots and skis.
Think of the ski trail as a path similar to a nature hike.
Under good conditions you'll be able to cover greater distances than by walking - but you will very rarely get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on trails prepared for it.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would require going through the visa application process and passport control many times.
The Schengen Area, on the other hand, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay within the area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each country that is a member of Schengen, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines which products are considered antiques. Some taxing bodies define goods over one hundred years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, and the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft items may be considered antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood among the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this occupation is also important to many professionals in other fields.
But even traditionally, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; rather, they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and primarily kept reindeer as pack animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, which is the Sami region.
Although it is in widespread use, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because of the associations it evokes with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting receives a travel warning, this may affect your health insurance or flight cancellation insurance.
You should also consult with the governments of other countries, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
As one example, United States citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
Travel warnings are essentially a brief summary of the political situation in a specific country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and overly abstract compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious disruption of social order, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and raging fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal occurrences of severe weather include strong winds, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the danger of severe weather in the area, as it may disrupt travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be defined as a war zone should receive professional training.
Searching the internet for a hostile environment course will likely bring up the address of a local company.
A regular course will include all the topics discussed here in more detail, usually alongside practical experience.
The course will typically last between 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery in another country must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender marker (X) or documents updated to match the preferred name and gender varies.
The difference in the willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is no less significant.
Security checkpoint checks also became much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender individuals pre-surgery should not expect to be able to pass through scanners without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Backwash is the returning flow from waves breaking on the shore, often over a reef or the like.
Due to the underwater topography, the rip current is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a swift current to deep water may form there.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion, due to trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back isn't harder than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again, or according to your skills, and if they spotted you, maybe you should wait for extraction.
Reverse culture shock occurs earlier than culture shock (it has less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to the culture they were born into.
When you return home after living in a foreign country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits from your home culture.
When you first arrive in a foreign country, people are likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in new countries need to adjust.
People may not expect that patience and understanding will also be required for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
It is possible to see the pyramids in the dark, and it is possible to see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you can always hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as both a backdrop and a narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are subject to territorial claims by several countries and have the highest number of bases in Antarctica, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located about 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the others are Livingston Island, and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano forms a spectacularly beautiful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into a plain, and then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are located the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, the highest of which, rising to a height of 4892 m, is Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, with no cellular reception, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone, since you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by vessels, including cruise ships, as well as research expeditions that need remote data and voice communication.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
A possibility that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before university without hindering their education.
In many cases, registering for a course during a gap year abroad may actually improve your chances of being accepted to higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees are usually charged for enrollment in such study programs.
Finland is a wonderful sailing destination. In the land of a thousand lakes, there are also thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the island archipelago and in the lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although archipelagos of the largest coastal and lake regions are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
It's similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but beyond that, it's unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most of the special cruises in the Baltic Sea include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
The meaning is that you can visit the historic city for several full days and return to sleep on the ship at night.
If you are arriving at the shore only via cruise ship excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid as of 2009).
Some cruises mention Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying in an airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
This is nothing to be ashamed of; it's no different than personal fear or aversion to other things that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight may help overcome the fear that is based on uncertainty and lack of control.
Delivery companies get paid well for delivering things quickly. Often, time is a very important factor when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Some of the routes to the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they had sent things by air freight, on some routes the unloading of the cargo and the customs clearance could have taken a few days.
The only way to get it through faster would have been to send it as registered cargo. Aviation regulations wouldn't allow them to send cargo without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly business or first class is to pay a large sum for the privilege (or better yet, have your workplace pay for it).
However, it's not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of reaching their destinations quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment and declaration of independence of the Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, today a modern, developed and busy commercial center, surrounded by a magnificent bay and mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are punctuated by traditional red roofs, an 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, though the city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble statues of doves above some graves.
A trip to the intriguing village is worth half an hour.
A short distance to the north you can find the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, known to foreigners following a glowing description of its beauty written by Lord Byron.
Scooterbus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In addition, to the north you can visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (sanctuary), a place where the world-famous apparitions of Mary took place.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass burial site, as well as a site of almost incomprehensible significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more whose loved ones were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with all the respect, seriousness, and honor it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by marking or engraving graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of its residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are written in Catalan only because it was established by law as the primary official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are delivered in Catalan only, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and condescending.
Despite often being an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still to behave impeccably, like someone who is *bien élevé* (well-mannered). This will make it much easier to get around the city.
The Parisians' rude exterior will quickly evaporate if you display basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an especially wide variety of plant communities, due to the diverse microclimates, soil types, and varying water levels within it.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
You can find rare animals there, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and wood grouse, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and they must also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do indeed provide coverings for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own covering, especially one with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same vein, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
That can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
The Cypriot cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Middle East, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A popular and simple dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available topping such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie" when it means "you," always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between different verbs and objects.
It could be argued that this makes reading easier, although the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is being used as a noun complicates writing somewhat.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means expensive, while carro means chariot.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally consistent grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand expressions better.
Of course, it will be easier for someone who knows a Romance language to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may be tempted to hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that there is no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern expectations today are generally outdated, remaining as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday wasn't the problem it is today, they were usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are giant facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century CE.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the Emperor hosted cherry blossom viewing parties only for himself and other nobles surrounding the imperial court.
Plants look their best in a natural environment, therefore refrain from picking even just one flower.
When you visit an official garden, picking samples will result in your removal from the premises without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe and easy to navigate place, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
However, when you are located in the higher tropical regions a few degrees north of the Equator, you will also have to deal with heat (always) and strong sun (when the skies are clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you are considering taking goes into Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to base a vacation.
For example, a visit to castles in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube, or a cruise along the Erie Canal.
In addition, they mark trails for popular hiking and biking routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it symbolizes the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by people who do not believe in God in Christian countries, as well as by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter Vigil sleepless in a bare spot in order to watch the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very possible that it is a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night at the end of Easter weekend, and congregations typically begin celebrations exactly at midnight to mark the resurrection of Jesus.
All animals that originally arrived at the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been brought to the islands, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the North or South Pole in winter, you will experience a polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark throughout all hours of the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing teamwork over individual achievements.
Employees often need to obtain approval from their supervisors for decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their supervisors' instructions without question.
