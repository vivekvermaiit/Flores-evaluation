In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC shopping channel.
Ring also reached a settlement in a lawsuit with its security industry competitor, ADT.
Although an experimental vaccine has shown promise in reducing the fatality rate of Ebola, to date, no drug has been definitively proven to treat people already infected.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed great promise for real-world benefits, but formal studies indicated that it did not achieve the anticipated goal of preventing death.
ZMapp served as the control arm in the PALM trial, signifying that scientists considered it a benchmark against which the other three treatments were compared.
The USA Gymnastics Association endorses the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and agrees that the Olympic family absolutely needs to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.

This not only proves a widely circulated theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that most fossils cannot, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that this animal's outer feathers are chestnut brown, while the inner layers are off-white or carrot-colored.
This discovery also provides deep insights into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed rachis, the central shaft of a feather, but did possess other feather characteristics, namely barbs and barbules, researchers inferred that these other characteristics likely evolved into the rachis later on.
The structure of these feathers indicates they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers state that even if this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows it had mature feathers, not downy fluff.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathers in the specimen are fully developed and not the downy fluff of a juvenile animal.
A car bomb that detonated yesterday morning at the Gaziantep Police Headquarters in Turkey killed two police officers and injured more than twenty civilians.

They discovered that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in a system is driven by their luminosity and rotation, it's that simple.
A star's Rossby number is related to the flow of plasma, and must be determined by luminosity and rotation.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active a celestial body is in terms of magnetic field reversals.

Current research is mainly theoretical, but the purpose of this project is to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team wants to observe is the result of tidal forces caused by the interaction of dark matter from this galaxy and the Milky Way, respectively.
Just as the moon's gravity causes tides on Earth, the Milky Way galaxy also exerts a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
Scientists can determine that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
The theory claims that dark matter around a galaxy mostly forms a halo, and is composed of many particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
He stated in an interview that the new variant has an "extremely high mortality rate, making it very unsettling and alarming."
Dr. Moore believes that some patients may have contracted germs in the hospital, and at least two cases involve healthcare workers.
One infected person can potentially infect 10 to 15 close contacts within a year.
However, among the overall tuberculosis patient population, the proportion of those suffering from extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) appears to remain very low; in South Africa, at any given time, 6,000 out of every 330,000 people are infected.

"Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as large caves on Earth, which tend to maintain a more consistent temperature, but is more similar to caves that are deep underground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters go alone into a voting booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their choice into an envelope.
After official personnel confirm the voter's identity, the voter then places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French election law meticulously codifies the voting procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to witness that the boxes are empty of envelopes at the start of voting, and that no envelopes are added except those cast by authorized voters who are actually counting votes.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers follow specific procedures to count the ballots under strict supervision.

Her other event was the giant slalom, where she finished 10th in the women's —Å–∏–¥—è skiing category with a combined time of 4 minutes 41.30 seconds, 2 minutes 11.60 seconds behind the first-place Austrian athlete Claudia Loesch, and 1 minute 09.02 seconds behind the ninth-place Hungarian athlete Gy√∂ngyi Dani.
In the women's seated group, four skiers failed to finish the race, and out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom, 45 did not achieve a ranking in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five suspects in the rape of the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendant's names are Baba Kangal, Boosa Kangal, Rampro Kangal, Gaja Kangal, and Vishnu Kangal.
Officer Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendant appeared in court masked.
Although three people were inside the house when the vehicle crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The section of road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as emergency responders extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is currently in detention, awaiting indictment and trial, but because her image has been widely disseminated, any eyewitness testimony may be compromised.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, with courts believing that publishing photographs could create potential prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out, "If journalists release photos or other information about suspects, they do indeed appear to be walking a dangerous line."
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, which is responsible for overall prosecution matters, told reporters that it will make no further comment, at least until any prosecution.
According to the leaked documents, the document will mention the border dispute in which Palestine hopes to base its borders on those existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
Reportedly, other topics in the document include the future direction of Jerusalem, a holy city shared by both countries, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demanded that, if an agreement were signed, it would continue to station troops in the Jordan Valley for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to a troop presence of only five years.
Hunters participating in the harmful animal control augmentation trial will be closely supervised by national park rangers because relevant authorities need to monitor and evaluate the trial's performance.
The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) has partnered with the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) to recruit qualified volunteers under the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first shoot have received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Madri swore in yesterday before the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which is composed of nine members.
This is Madrid's fifth temporary election commission in four years.
As part of a package of measures to propel the nation towards new elections, the Presidential Committee recommended last month that the former Provisional Electoral Commission resign.
The committee was established by President Maduro in response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due as early as 2011.
Reports indicate approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating, resulting in a total of 6 fires and causing minor burns to 4 people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported another 34 overheating incidents to them, which the company claims were "not serious."
The government department responded, saying that Apple's delay in reporting was "regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 a.m. local time (Friday 09:19 p.m. GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Office says it has not received any reports of damage domestically.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six deaths have been confirmed.
They first released six hostages, including children and the elderly, such as the Filipino photographer.
The two photographers later swapped places with an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. In the end, Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical field.
He trained to be an obstetrician and began practicing at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Sir Liggins would use his time after work to study premature births.
His research shows that administering a certain hormone will accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer once said, "Luna was the original extreme queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a double moon night, very special, just like she was. Strong woman."
Famous wrestler "Goldust" Dustin Runnels commented, "Luna was just as weird as me‚Ä¶ maybe even weirder‚Ä¶ I loved her and will miss her‚Ä¶ I hope she's gone to a better place."
Among the 1400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic was 8% higher than in 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
In the poll, 34% of people agreed with the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
Among the two extreme results in the poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was originally scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as three swimming relays, at the Commonwealth Games, but his symptoms have raised doubts about his physical condition.
He can't take medication to suppress the pain because the Olympics prohibits the use of those drugs.
Central Missouri University mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
By early February, several individuals had verified the discovery using different hardware and software, and it was officially announced on Tuesday.
Water on Earth may have been brought by comets, and the organic matter in the water could form proteins and supply the needs of life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially that of Earth, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called these rumors "political chitchat and foolishness."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration claims can shorten flight paths, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and significantly reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no other transportation options available, the Overground will not stop at Wembley, and there will be no parking or park-and-ride facilities available on site.
Due to concerns about transportation difficulties, the match may be forced to start without supporters from each team being able to attend and cheer.
A study published in the journal *Science* on Thursday reported that new bird species are forming in Ecuador's Gal√°pagos Islands.
Although it was previously believed that the evolution of new species took longer, researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Switzerland have discovered that this new species evolved in just two generations. It is a hybrid of the local endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) and the foreign cactus finch (Geospiza scandens).
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can be rolled into minuscule shapes.
Gold can be drawn into fine wires, which can then be wound and woven. It can also be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. Because it can be made so thin, it is sometimes used in a type of book called "illuminated manuscripts" to decorate the hand-painted illustrations within.
This is called chemical acidity. You can use purple cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (pH) of the chemicals.
The pH value is determined by the hydrogen ion concentration in a chemical substance (the H in pH refers to hydrogen).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix these 2 kinds of dry powder together, then use clean hands dampened with water to squeeze them into a ball shape.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, resulting in a strange texture and forming a shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
In the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewage systems have been found under houses.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses used by both men and women.
When you call a friend who is far away, it's done through artificial satellites.
Artificial satellites in space receive signals and instantly reflect them back to Earth.
Artificial satellites are sent into space using rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere can sometimes distort our light and vision.
Giant rockets exceeding 100 feet in height are needed to put satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The wheel's greatest contribution to humanity is providing us with simpler and faster modes of transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and other transportation devices.
Below them are more diverse species of mid-sized felines, primarily feeding on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, many small cats (occasionally including domestic cats) also prey on a large number of small prey, including insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to success lies in the concept of niche, meaning that each cat should have a unique job to do so they don't compete with each other.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult male lions, along with up to thirty female lions and cubs.
Female lions are usually closely related to each other, being sisters and daughters within the same extended family.
The behavior of lion prides is very similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs; these two animals are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats), and are also very ruthless towards their prey.
Tigers are all-around athletes, capable of climbing (though not particularly specialized), swimming, long-distance jumping, and possessing a pulling force more than five times that of a strong human.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera). Only these four species of felines are capable of roaring.
A tiger's roar isn't a purely vocal roar like a lion's, but rather more like a chaotic, shouted phrase.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, hunting monkeys, snakes, and rodents, and birds if they can. Ocelots' prey are almost always much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that the ocelot relies on its sense of smell to track and find prey, using scent to locate where prey frequents.
They have good night vision at night and can move silently. The oncilla hunts by blending into its surroundings and then pouncing on its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (for example, by crossing a mountain range or river, or migrating to a new island, making it difficult to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment different from what they were used to.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore new populations need different qualities or changes to possess stronger competitiveness than in the past.
The original population remained completely unchanged, so they still needed the same adaptive functions as before.
As time passed, the new population began to adapt to the new environment, and their appearance became increasingly different from others.
Eventually, after thousands, or even millions of years, these two groups will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which refers to the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence of the evolutionary process and also a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide humans breathe out.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. Plants can also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes, and most of the food we eat is also plants; without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus were apex predators of that era, so they feared no creatures except other mosasaurs.
Its long lower jaw is lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and with another set of teeth in its upper jaw, this means that any creature that stands in its way cannot escape.
Although not certain, we believe it may have had a forked tongue. It would have eaten turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been cannibalistic.
It will also attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for it.
While most of the food Romans ate is familiar to us, they did consume some bizarre or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women would sit on chairs to eat their food, wealthy men preferred to participate in banquets together and recline while enjoying their meals during the feast.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods that would be introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans never ate turkey either.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, and those temples were regarded as the homes of the gods.
People prepare offerings to present to the gods, and priests strive to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Some temples also have special pyramid-shaped towers built within them, called temple towers.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not as important.
Much of Jewish family life is spent outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shop was just a counter facing the street. People at that time built houses with stones.
Because the land of Canaan didn't have large forests, wood was especially expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he went further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although every country is "Scandinavian," there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think the back of the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map drawn on it.
However, that is not the case. Although there is some handwriting on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The text on the back of the United States Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4th July 1776". The text is written upside down at the bottom.
Although no one knows who wrote this text, it is certain that this large parchment document (approximately 29¬æ inches by 24¬Ω inches) was originally stored rolled up.
Therefore, the addition of this phrase is likely just for labeling purposes.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
The area was governed by French "Vichy" people. These Frenchmen were on peaceful terms with the Germans in 1940, and cooperated with the invaders instead of resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded southern France in an operation known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant number of people (i.e., a society) who live and work together in a collaborative manner.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means "of a citizen." It is related to the Latin words "civis" and "civitas," meaning "citizen" and "city or city-state" respectively, which in a way defines the scale of society.
The city-state is the precursor to the nation-state, and civilization and culture refer to the knowledge passed down through generations, the continuous traces of culture, and widespread dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving historical traces, making it impossible to recognize them as legitimate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, these thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation (with Congress as its sole institution).
Congress had no power to tax, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it had to rely on the state authorities, which often did not cooperate with each other, to enforce the laws.
It also has no power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
These regulations require unanimous consent from all states to be amended, and the states' attitude towards the central government is very cavalier, with their representatives frequently absent.
Both the Italy national football team and the Germany national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, and they were also the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians also participate in related international and Olympic events.
Japan boasts nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making it the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to Japan consisting of a group/set of islands, from a geographical perspective, Japan is often classified as an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century when European sailors, passing by, recorded the island's name as Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous agricultural practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in the company's rice and sugarcane fields.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) government used military force to take control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, it declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Dynasty.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan. Japan then began to rule Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures: the Intihuatana stone, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the historical site have been reconstructed to help tourists better understand their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was also the primary film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still in production to this day, but more importantly, digital cameras have adopted its aspect ratio for their image sensors.
In fact, the 35mm format is somewhat confusing, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (when divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS advanced photo system format) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in a composition.
It suggests that after dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally, the intersections of the lines are the most effective positions for the subject (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has kept the nations of Europe closely connected, despite the continued existence of differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affects everyone, from kings to commoners.
A core tenet of Christianity is that wealth must be used to help the suffering and the poor, and church funds are specifically established for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the power center of the church has been located in Rome, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether the church truly adheres to this creed.
Soon after the outbreak of war, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy of cutting off essential military and civilian supplies has indeed worked, even though this type of blockade violates international laws established through numerous international agreements over the past two centuries and widely accepted by nations.
The UK laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire area, even endangering neutral vessels.
Because other countries had little reaction to this tactic, Germany believed that their unrestricted submarine warfare would not provoke a strong backlash either.
In the 1920s, the general attitude of most citizens and the nation towards the world was pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations were determined to prevent such a recurrence in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and took a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Batchelor, his manager from his previous job.
Ancient China used unique methods to represent different periods; each stage of China or the families in power belonged to distinct dynasties.
Furthermore, periods of dynastic change were also times of division and upheaval in various regions. The most famous example of this is the Three Kingdoms period of 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles engaged in fierce wars to compete for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with countless people losing their lives in the struggle to sit on the throne in the magnificent imperial palace of Chang'an.
Revolutions produce many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transformation of autocracy into republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people rather than being exclusively owned by a monarch.
Furthermore, after the revolution, all positions were open to any man actively seeking employment, allowing the most willing and accomplished to take charge.
The same situation occurred in the military, because they were no longer using rank to distinguish military positions, but rather using talent as the standard.
The French Revolution also inspired oppressed working classes in many other countries to launch revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this material world. He often went to meditate in a cave called Hira on Mount Nur (Light).
The cave itself has undergone changes through the ages, revealing a vivid aspect of the Muhammadan spirit.
This cave is located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In reality, even if someone knew of its existence, it wouldn't be easy to find. Once inside the cave, you'd be completely isolated from the world.
Beyond the clear, beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen; inside the cave, only a small fraction of the world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid was built by Egyptians in the 3rd century BC and is one of the many large pyramid structures built to commemorate deceased pharaohs.
Located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Pyramid Complex," contains several pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, the largest pyramid in the world), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the massive Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives, concubines, and family members.
The "up-bow" mark looks like a V, and the "down-bow" mark looks like a staple, or a square with an opening at the bottom.
Up indicates that you should push the bow starting from the tip, and down indicates that you should pull the bow starting from the frog (where your hand holds the bow).
An up-bow marking usually indicates a lighter sound, while a down-bow marking indicates a stronger and more assertive sound.
Please feel free to make marks with a pencil, but please remember that the bowing markings printed on the page all have a musical purpose, so they should not be ignored.
A frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Th√©r√®se and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Princess Elisabeth, were forced by a group of market women to move from the Palace of Versailles back to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a mob who shouted threats and insults at the King and Queen along the way.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a member of the mob even brandished the head of a royal guard, who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, covering most of the government's expenses, while bond interest floated through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the exorbitant profits the United States has long extracted from the exploitation of Filipinos have become a fundamental gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the organization's creation.
These events generally occurred during a period called the High Middle Ages, which corresponds to the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000‚Äì1300) in European history.
The mid-Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, and traditionally the Middle Ages are considered to have ended around 1500.
The term technological determinism encompasses a range of practiced concepts, from technology-driven or technology-led change, to the more rigorous idea that "scientific laws and the related logic behind science's manifestations in technology drive human destiny."
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the path of technological development itself has a greater influence than cultural or political factors, and that technology, in turn, "influences" inherent social patterns, rather than being constrained by society.
For example, some people say that automobiles inevitably drive road development.
However, building a nationwide highway network for a small number of cars was not economically effective, so people developed new manufacturing methods to reduce the cost of owning a car.
As car ownership increases, the likelihood of road accidents also rises, which in turn drives the development of new medical technologies for repairing injured limbs.
Cultural determinism is an important component of Romanticism, drawing heavily from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, the geographical environment shapes the individual, and over time, customs and cultures arise that are associated with that geographical environment. These customs and cultures, being harmoniously aligned with the local society, are superior to laws implemented arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is hailed as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was hailed as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its status gradually declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned with souvenirs such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets sold.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was greatly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a unique style. A major advancement at the time was that members of the Crusades began using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming where crop yields are only sufficient to feed the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple agricultural system, often employing organic farming methods, preserving and using native crop seeds from the local ecoregion, and utilizing crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and many developing countries still do.
Subcultures bring together people with similar interests who feel ignored by the social mainstream, fostering a sense of identity.
Subcultures are often distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, geographic location, or gender of their members.
The qualities that allow a subculture to establish itself may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or various other factors.
Subculture members typically highlight their belonging to the group through special, symbolic forms, including clothing, mannerisms, and the use of slang.
A common way to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their upbringing, have been deprived of the socialization process that adults provide.
Such children are called "feral children." Some feral children have suffered confinement (often by their parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because their parents do not accept that the child has a severe intellectual or physical disability.
Homeless children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Other children have been claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, they will exhibit almost identical behaviors to the animal that raised them (physiological conditions permitting), such as displaying fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, and scaffolding takes it to the next level.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a form of support that can be provided to individuals undergoing new learning experiences (such as using a new computer program or starting a new project).
Scaffolding can be virtual or physical; in other words, teachers and the Microsoft Office Clippy assistant are both forms of scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software, and its function is to ask questions, provide hints, and explain procedures that students may find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are sent to foster care for many reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up without nurture, care, and education, but the reality is not so.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster families should provide them with all the necessities they lacked in their previous homes.
The internet combines mass and interpersonal communication.
From a uses and gratifications perspective, the distinct characteristics of the Internet have opened up new frontiers.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" can both be said to be important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998), when investigating audience reactions to websites, found that "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" were also new motivational dimensions.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in interpreting microexpressions and facial movements that last only milliseconds.
In particular, some believe that microexpressions can be accurately interpreted to detect whether someone is lying.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out that people with brain damage who are unable to understand the content of a speech can still accurately sense the speaker's sincerity.
He even believes that animals like domestic dogs may possess this ability to interpret human behavior.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of gene variations: recessive and dominant.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, while natural selection removes it from the standing variation.
In each generation, separation and recombination cause constant changes in dominant and recessive gene pools.
Primate animals with digestive systems similar to humans struggle to obtain enough amino acids from plants on the savanna.
Furthermore, insufficient amino acid intake can lead to serious consequences: stunted growth and malnutrition, ultimately resulting in death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the protein available in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all factors, we shouldn't be surprised if the way our ancestors solved the "protein problem" was similar to that of chimpanzees in the savannas today.
Sleep fragmentation refers to the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then falling back asleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
You can easily achieve this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, allowing you to be conscious without fully waking up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm in your sleep, you can place the alarm clock on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other period-based choices include drinking a large amount of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The more relaxed your mind and body are, the stronger your vitality will be. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only obstacle on the path to enlightenment is our own anxiety and negative energy.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but it flourished due to the Mahayana Buddhist path of love and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is, in principle, very simple, encompassing Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the devotional practice of embracing all beings.
When practicing Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra recitation, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan Buddhism meditation is deity yoga. Through visualizing deities, one purifies all energy channels, activates the chakras, and establishes enlightened awareness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, prompting cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, conflicts in systems, practices, and culture created a rift between these countries.
World War II had ended just two years prior, and former allies had already become enemies, marking the start of the Cold War.
It lasted for forty consecutive years, with proxy armies engaging in actual combat on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense lines had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup near the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were all scrapped overnight. Over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements by invading eastern Poland, and subsequently entered Belarus and Ukraine, forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Shipping goods by sea is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
Traditionally, the navy's mission is to ensure the nation can safely transfer people and goods, while disrupting enemy states' operations of transferring personnel and goods.
One of the most noteworthy modern examples is the Battle of the North Atlantic in World War II, where Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy attempted to disrupt shipping (primarily using U-boats).
If the Allies had lost, Germany might have conquered Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them for milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats are usually pastured in hills or other grazing areas, typically cared for by goat herders, often children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
England built horse-drawn railways as early as the 16th century.
Although the four-wheel wagonway consisted of only parallel wooden rails, it allowed horses to pull goods on the track, resulting in faster transport speeds and heavier loads compared to the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Railroads were fixed in place using sleepers very early on. But gradually, people discovered that laying iron rails resulted in higher efficiency.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, and with the emergence of Homo Erectus, humans began walking upright two million years ago.
Their evolutionary predecessors, the Australopithecus, were not accustomed to walking upright.
Bipedal locomotion has been observed in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus tchadensis may have walked bipedally as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly life, we can dedicate ourselves to the environmental movement, and we can even become social activists, to minimize future suffering.
This is often like "treating the head when the head aches, and treating the foot when the foot aches." However, if we want more than just temporary solutions, then we should find the root cause of the problems and solve them thoroughly.
The world has been changed by the progress of human science and technology, and the problem has been exacerbated by overpopulation and wasteful human lifestyles; this is abundantly clear.
After being passed by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Printed 150 to 200 copies overnight, now known as the "Dunlap broadside".
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and George Washington read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 known surviving Dalleep single-sided prints are the oldest extant versions of this document, as the original manuscript has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, which are what we call birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think of them as a type of dinosaur.
However, birds and dinosaurs still share many similarities.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
In reality, all computers today are based on processing messages made up of binary code.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These digits are called binary digits, or bits, as they are known in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not manifest immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are too common to form the basis of a direct diagnosis.
The best way to recognize signs of poisoning is by noticing open containers of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the first aid instructions on the specific poison label.
The term "bed bug" is the formal name used by entomologists for this type of insect.
This name comes from the ancient understanding of bedbugs -- that they are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs both share the characteristic of growing in nests, adapting to life in nests or the dwellings of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the entire United States, making it a leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
The couple may determine that raising the baby is not in their or the child's best interests.
These couples can choose to plan the adoption of their children.
Adoption refers to the termination of parental rights by the biological parents, allowing another couple to raise their child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method effectively guides the majority of scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only way; experiments are tests that can eliminate one or more hypotheses, but asking questions and making observations can also lead to scientific research.
Natural historians and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's viewpoints on scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek learning, the Western world severed its ties to the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
The physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by many scholars are often highly dependent on the body's internal biological cycles and the substances produced by the biological clock.
Circadian rhythms, which not only respond to external periodic cues, can be observed in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues to cycle autonomously even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the key experiments that demonstrated DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, also known as viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments: one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of bacteriophages, and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the proteins of bacteriophages.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by offspring, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-themed tours attract people interested in nature to enjoy natural scenery, including wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.
For example, visiting, filming, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, a group of people drive out of the small rural town to their workplaces, passing another group of people whose starting point is precisely the destination of the first group.
In this bustling traffic, everyone is connected to some degree to this car-based transportation system and supports its existence.
Modern science indicates that such large-scale carbon economic activities have already caused the biosphere to deviate from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social activities and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints like those about water quality and bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system attract so much complaint, and why are there problems every day? Is it because transportation engineers are incompetent, or are there more fundamental reasons?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations, as well as the interactions between road users.
The problem is that studying traffic flow is very difficult because driving habits cannot be predicted with one hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, driving behavior tends to fall within a reasonably consistent range, so traffic flow also tends to exhibit reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we define the relationship between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful for the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were among the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allows them to more easily evade predators and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them more small places to burrow into and hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many hold the opposite view; they believe that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and the one with the largest water volume. Its water volume is eight times that of the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching six miles wide.
Of all the river water flowing into the ocean on Earth, a full 20% comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale of construction and superior techniques of the Giza pyramids remain unmatched.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were astonished by the historical ruins left behind by their ancestors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has a population of around eight hundred, making it the smallest independent country in the world, and also the least populous country.
Italian is used for the laws and official documents of the Vatican City.
Italian is also the language commonly used by most of the working population in the country, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have recognized basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these elements exist in their native form in nature and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that all things are composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the 4 states of matter (arranged in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also speculated that they would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon) are also possible.
Everything in the universe is composed of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are unimaginably small, so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, with the rise of new writing methods, the status and usage rate of pencils have gradually declined.
Everyone now writes messages on computer screens, so pencil sharpeners are no longer needed.
We can only wonder, and wait for new inventions to appear, where the keyboard will go from here.
The operating principle of a nuclear fission bomb is based on the fact that fusing many protons and neutrons into an atomic nucleus requires a large amount of energy.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the atom again would then release a portion of that energy.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, meaning they are prone to splitting even without, or with very little, external force.
The moon's surface is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is about 70 kilometers thick at the near end and about 100 kilometers thick at the far end.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
Perhaps the near side has more lunar maria due to the thinner crust. Magma can more easily rise to the surface here.
The core of content theory is to identify what moves or attracts people.
These theories posit that people have certain needs or desires that are internalized during the process of growing into adulthood.
These theories explore what makes certain people desire certain things, and what in their environment makes them want to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, when a supervisor begins to lead former peers, two behaviors are likely to occur. One is the attempt to maintain being a member of the peer group.
These types of managers struggle to make unpopular decisions, enforce discipline, conduct performance evaluations, assign areas of responsibility, and hold subordinates accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, they will transform into a completely different person who believes they must change everything the team has been doing and do things their own way.
Ultimately, a leader is responsible for the success or failure of their team.
This behavior often creates division between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams must adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members are often the points of contact for the physical team they directly work with.
They usually have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones, and their local management may not understand this.
Possessing a truly "invisible management team" (excerpted from Larson and LaFasto's 1989 work, page 109) is also a unique element that constitutes a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" is a management team where each member reports directly to the team, and the team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning institution? One goal of putting an organization's learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and originality can be unleashed when all functional departments within an organization effectively utilize all available resources.
Therefore, the process of organizations working together to overcome obstacles can drive innovation to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders should cultivate a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) described the continuum model, which is a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides concrete evidence for the theoretical methods of cognitive research, thus narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in conducting research.
For a long time, people have known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The invention of new technologies allows us to observe and study previously unseen brain structures and operational processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which helps us understand the processes of how our minds work.
Although artificial intelligence has strong science fiction connotations, it has nonetheless become a crucial branch of computer science dedicated to dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
One area of artificial intelligence research is creating machines that can automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and the identification of handwritten text, voices, and human faces.
These developments led to different disciplines, with the focus on finding solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are also built into some home computers and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of school education. Often, teachers want to take students to places that buses can't reach.
Technology offers virtual field trips as a solution. Students can sit in the classroom and visit museum artifacts, tour aquariums, or admire beautiful art.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a great way to revisit the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year for their visit to the state capital, and while the website is updated annually, older versions remain online, serving as a scrapbook.
Blogging also helps to improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, they can generally change this because of the presence of readers.
Because students are often the most critical readers, bloggers are beginning to work harder to improve their writing in order to avoid being criticized.
Writing blogs also "forces students to better understand the world around them" in order to satisfy audience interest, motivating students to become more intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond traditional school life.
Using blogs correctly can enhance students' analytical and critical thinking skills; students can actively respond to online learning materials, clearly define their position within the context of articles written by others, and also outline their own perspectives on specific issues (O'Hear, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, with a beautiful and pleasant environment, uses both English and French, and has many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, while to the north are Muskoka and other regions, where the natural beauty remains untapped.
All of these things, and many others, contribute to Ontario being seen as the quintessential Canadian image by outsiders.
Vast areas further north are sparsely populated, with some being nearly uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising population comparison: the number of African Americans residing in the United States is greater than the entire citizen population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is one of the largest islands, with abundant wildlife, making the island itself a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or have historical ties to France, and are known for their luxurious seaside resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and Islam greatly developed in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope route from Europe to India.
It borders the Sahel region to the north, and is adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female tourists, regardless of their actual marital status, refer to themselves as married.
Wearing a ring might help (but don't wear one that looks too expensive).
Female friends should also understand that cultural differences may lead to situations they consider harassment, such as being followed or having their arms grabbed, which are not uncommon.
When rejecting a man, be firm and don't be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, this is always wrong!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used it as a strategic port, known as Anfa.
The Portuguese leveled and rebuilt the city, naming it "Casa Branca" (White House), but abandoned the site after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it "Dar al-Baida." "Casablanca," however, was the name given to it by Spanish traders who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the old city of Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, including tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and all sorts of fancy ornaments, but these are mostly aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the easternmost side, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, burying most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, if you want to travel outside of Goma, you must do your homework and understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and offers some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a Boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma, with short trips typically costing around 500 Congolese francs (local price).
Because it was relatively difficult to access, "Timbuktu" gradually became a symbol of a faraway and exotic land.
Present-day Timbuktu is an impoverished town, but its past reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was listed as an endangered World Heritage Site due to the threat of desert dust and sand.
This is one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, "Africa's Great Civilizations."
This city differs significantly from other cities in the country, as it leans towards an Arabic style rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,000 square kilometers, is divided into fourteen ecological zones, and is home to various wild plants and animals.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is also considered the flagship attraction of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, this park has daily conservation and entrance fees.
Perhaps it would be more cost-effective to buy a Wild Card, which allows you entry into select parks in South Africa, or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and a popular tourist destination.
Some say that the row of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline, set against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour, resemble a radiant and glittering bar graph.
If you want to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, you can leave Hong Kong Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite shore.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
British colonists seized this place, so if you want to find evidence of colonial history on this land, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area within India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
This forest is not only mangrove swamp, but also includes a portion of the massive jungle that once covered the Ganges Plain, now only a few remnants remain.
The Sundarbans forest covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water or swamp.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. The area is currently estimated to have 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the regional bus station (across the river) all day, but most buses leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang.
Since the route bus is often full, it is recommended that you purchase your ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are accessible by comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster buses.
Taking a shared taxi is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting Oyapock, Brazil, with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high and the bridge is 378 meters long, with two lanes each 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
This bridge is scheduled to fully open to traffic in September 2017, coinciding with the expected completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoint.
The Guarani people are the most important indigenous people living in eastern Paraguay today, leading a semi-nomadic life while also engaging in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guakuru and Payagua, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay (previously known as "the giant province of the Indies") was born from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunci√≥n has strived to maintain many of Paraguay's local characteristics and features.
Argentina is known for having world-class polo teams and players.
The year's biggest tournament will be held at the Las Canitas Polo Club in December.
Smaller tournaments or competitions are also held at other times of the year.
For news regarding the tournament and polo match ticket purchases, please contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
The island's only bank is located in Stanley, opposite "Falkland Islands Company (FIC) West Store," and is the only place to exchange currency.
Pound sterling is generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted in Stanley.
While foreign currency (USD/GBP) might be accepted in the outer islands, credit cards likely won't be; please inquire with the businesses beforehand to confirm which payment methods are accepted.
It's nearly impossible to exchange its currency outside the Falkland Islands, so be sure to exchange it before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, and the temperature often exceeds 30 degrees Celsius in the summer.
The winter there can be deceptively cold because the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel much colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no specific "rainy seasons" or "dry seasons," and the annual rainfall is distributed approximately evenly.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are wild after all, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities point out that a distance of at least 100 yards/meters should be maintained from bears and wolves, and a distance of 25 yards/meters should be maintained from other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, moose, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can be aggressive.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they fail to keep a safe distance. These animals are large, undomesticated, and potentially dangerous, so please give them plenty of space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, this port was the site of a notorious naval standoff when seven warships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
Except for one British vessel, all other ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans perished.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed in a peaceful gathering in town.
Auckland spans two harbors, so it has many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in 3 regions.
North Shore beaches (North Harbour area) are located along the Pacific coast, extending from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Those places are almost all safe-swimming beaches, and most have shade provided by New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on the WaitematƒÅ Harbour, between Mission Bay in central Auckland and the upscale suburb of St Heliers.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, lined with rows of shops along the shore. It's safe to swim here.
The main local beer is "First," which isn't a complex-flavored beer, but rather a smooth and refreshing one. Another local beer is called "Manta."
Although there are many French wines as well, New Zealand and Australian wines may be more resistant to long-distance transportation.
The local tap water is very safe and drinkable straight from the tap, but if you're not comfortable with that, bottled water is also readily available.
For Australians, "white coffee" is a foreign concept. Espresso is "espresso," cappuccino is coffee topped with a mountain of whipped cream (not milk froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The juice is expensive, but very delicious.
Many people travel to the Great Barrier Reef in all seasons, and very few are injured there as a result.
Visitors should still heed the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, box jellyfish appear near beaches and estuaries north of 1770. They can also occasionally be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not very active in the ocean; their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind, knowing they'll have a place to sleep upon arrival.
Travel agencies usually partner with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodations through them, like campsites.
Travel packages offered by travel agencies usually include breakfast and round-trip airport transportation, and may even offer bundles combining flights and hotels.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to consider the proposal or gather other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, if you encounter any issues that need improvement or have any requests, you should contact the travel agency first, rather than contacting the hotel directly.
During some festivals, the majority of tourists attending the music festival choose to camp on-site, and they largely consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to watch the event up close, you have to go in early and find a campsite near the music performance.
Please remember that even after the main stage music performances end, performances in other areas of the music festival may continue late into the night.
Some festival venues arrange dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If you're traversing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, make sure to check the location of your cabin, because passing through pack ice can create some truly terrifying noises in the cabins most affected.
The St. Petersburg cruise itinerary includes city sightseeing. Passengers on board do not require a visa (check relevant regulations).
Casinos usually make many efforts to keep guests staying longer and spending more. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it's difficult to find the exits.
They usually offer special meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and to keep them on the premises.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, getting drunk can impair judgment, and good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high-altitude areas or on mountain roads should consider the likelihood of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is very low, and you cannot drive as you would on normal asphalt pavement.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to leave you stranded.
Snowfall or blowing snow, condensation, or ice buildup on car windows can all reduce visibility.
On the other hand, in many countries, snowy and icy climates are very common, and transportation is almost unobstructed throughout the year.
Safari is arguably the most attractive tourism element in Africa and a highlight of many visitors' trips.
The term "Safari" generally refers to an overland trip to appreciate the magnificent African wildlife, especially the flora and fauna of the savanna.
Elephants and giraffes, among other animals, often approach vehicles, so the standard equipment will allow you to see them more clearly.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes afraid of people approaching, making binoculars more suitable for observing them.
A bushwalk (also known as a jungle walk, wilderness hike, or hike) involves hiking, and the trip can last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the events will take place in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, the last time being in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a bit of a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary by company, but most COVID-19-related cancellation policies were not extended past the end of March to July 2020, the originally scheduled date for the Olympics.
Most event tickets are expected to range from ¬•2,500 to ¬•130,000, with general admission tickets costing around ¬•7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for loan, even if they are not provided in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer to dry your socks, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it may shrink, and in extreme cases, it may burn).
Among many water purification methods, some are more effective at addressing specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, it requires several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if you have any concerns, consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter animal pests that are uncommon in their hometowns.
Pests can damage food, cause discomfort, and, worse, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that harm or kill people, are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from import duties and consumption taxes in certain areas.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on goods like tobacco and alcohol.
The stretch of road between Bonn Marian and Fairmont, passing through many remote and desolate areas, is considered the most challenging section to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, please stay alert: steep hills, narrow roads, and sharp turns are the vast majority.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than the preceding and following sections of road, typically 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and strict adherence to these limits is even more important than on other sections.
What's intriguing, though, is that the mobile service here is much stronger than in other sections along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very delicious, and Bavarian pastries are rich and diverse, similar to their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit pastries are very common, with apples being made into pastries year-round, while cherries and plums appear on the table in the summer.
Many German baked goods often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often especially good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small and satisfying snack, you can try a fried jam-filled doughnut, which has different names depending on the region: Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with a base of herbs and spices, with the addition of meat or vegetables.
Curry can be categorized as "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
Yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes in Pakistan and inland North India, while coconut milk is often substituted in South India and other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent.
Indonesian cuisine, made up of food from over 17,000 islands, is an umbrella term encompassing the country's wide variety of regional dishes.
However, when used without other qualifiers, this term usually refers to food originating from central and eastern Java Island.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout Indonesia, mainly consists of simply seasoned dishes, with the most common seasonings being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups are used to support a rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They can provide more stability for the rider, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet could get stuck.
If a rider falls from a horse but a foot gets caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged as the horse runs off. Many safety precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Furthermore, some saddles (especially English saddles) have safety bars that, when pulled back by the rider during a fall, will release the stirrup leathers from the saddle.
Cochamo Valley ‚Äì Chile's premier rock climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts a wide variety of massive granite walls and cliffs.
The mountaintop offers breathtaking views. Rock climbers from around the world continue to establish new routes on the cliffs, which are full of potential.
Alpine skiing, including both two-plank skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport where participants attach skis or snowboards to their feet and slide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a popular travel event for many people, who are sometimes referred to as ski enthusiasts, and they plan their entire vacation around skiing, staying in a specific location.
The concept of skiing has existed for a long time, with cave paintings depicting skiers as early as 5000 BC.
The origins of downhill skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as ski mountaineering, backcountry skiing, or alpine touring.
This activity is similar to ski mountaineering, but generally does not involve alpine skiing and mountaineering, both of which take place on steep terrain and require sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, the distance you can cover pulling a sled in the snow will be slightly longer than hiking, but you'll rarely reach the speed of unloaded backcountry skiing on groomed trails.
Although the European continent is relatively small, it is home to many independent countries. Generally, traveling between several countries means having to apply for multiple visas and go through numerous passport checks.
However, in this respect, the Schengen Area operates like a single country.
As long as you remain in this area, you generally do not need to go through passport control checkpoints again to cross the border.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for visas for each individual Schengen member state, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a universally accepted definition of which man-made items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define items older than 100 years as antiques.
Different geographical regions have different definitions, and in places like North America, the age restriction may be shorter than in Europe.
Although handicrafts have a shorter lifespan than similar mass-produced goods, they may be recognized as antiques.
For the Sami people, reindeer herding is an important livelihood, and the surrounding culture of the reindeer industry is equally important to the many Sami people with other specializations.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami people engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, many subsisted on fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and regarded reindeer as draft animals for pulling loads and carrying goods.
Today, many Sami people are involved in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and inaccurate understandings of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
Besides searching yourself, you might also want to consult the government for advice, but their recommendations are designed for their citizens.
For example, an American citizen in the Middle East might face a different situation than a European or an Arab citizen.
The consultation opinions are just a brief summary of the political situation in a certain country.
Compared to the detailed information available elsewhere, the perspectives they offer are often cursory, generalized, and oversimplified.
Severe weather is a general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it comes in different types, depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rain or snowstorms, and wildfires are manifestations and consequences of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
It is strongly recommended that tourists pay attention to whether severe weather may affect travel areas, as severe weather may impact travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to countries considered war zones should undergo professional training.
Searching for "hostile environment course" on the internet should lead you to the address of a local company.
The course will typically explain all the issues discussed here in a more detailed manner, often supplemented with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and involves role-playing, extensive first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Survival books and magazines are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad must bring valid return travel documents.
Governments may not be willing to issue passports without a specified gender (X), or to update documents for people who desire a specific name and gender.
There is a wide variation in the extent to which governments of different countries are willing to recognize these documents.
Security screenings became more stringent after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanning machines without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents of water flowing away from the shore, formed when waves break and recede, and they often occur near reefs or similar structures.
Based on the underwater topography, backflowing waves will concentrate in a few deeper areas and may generate rapid currents flowing towards deeper water.
Most fatalities occur when people exhaust themselves trying to swim back against the current, an effort with a very slim chance of success.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back to shore isn't any more difficult than usual.
Try swimming towards a place where you won't be trapped again, or, depending on your swimming skills and whether anyone has noticed you, you can also wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock appears faster than culture shock (with little to no honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and is more severe.
For tourists who easily adapt to new cultures, readjusting and reintegrating into their own native culture can sometimes be particularly difficult.
After living abroad for a while and returning home, you've adapted to the new culture and forgotten some habits you developed from your home country's culture.
When you first arrive in a foreign country, people understand that newcomers need time to adjust, and they will generally treat you with patience and understanding.
But for returning hometown wanderers, people may feel there's no need to tolerate or understand them anymore.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and quietly admire them before the show begins.
Usually, you can constantly hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The interwoven sounds and lights create a storybook-like atmosphere.
The performance is set against the backdrop of the Sphinx, which also narrates a long story.
The image is projected onto the pyramid, while lights illuminate the other pyramids.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, which have the most bases; in 2020, there were sixteen bases in operation.
This archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, home to the human settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, the latter being a volcanic caldera flooded by water to form a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains converge here into highlands before reappearing to form the Ellsworth Mountains, stretching for 360 kilometers, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
Vinson Massif, the highest mountain range in Antarctica, is 4,892 meters above sea level and is located in the northern part of Antarctica, also known as the Sentinel Range.
In remote areas where cell phone signals don't reach, you may only be able to use satellite phones.
Generally speaking, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because you need to be outdoors and pointed at a satellite to make a call.
Ships, including recreational boats and expedition vessels with remote data and audio needs, frequently use this service.
Your local telecommunications service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, traveling and learning are increasingly popular choices.
This is particularly popular with graduating students, allowing them a year off before graduating from university without sacrificing their studies.
Often, participating in a gap year program abroad can actually improve your chances of being accepted into higher education after you return home.
Generally speaking, tuition fees are required to participate in these teaching programs.
Finland is a great place for boating. Known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," Finland also boasts thousands of islands in its lakes or coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats, even kayaks, can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is consistent with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but quite exceptional in other regions (e.g., in the Netherlands the ratio is 1 to 40).
Most Baltic cruises spend extra time in St. Petersburg, Russia.
In other words, you could spend several full days exploring this historic city and return to the ship for the night.
If you are disembarking as part of a cruise ship tour, you do not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise itineraries mention Berlin in their brochures. As shown in the map above, Berlin is not located by the sea, so visiting this city is not included in the cruise fare.
Regardless of age or background, air travel can be a daunting experience, especially for first-time flyers or those with traumatic experiences.
This is nothing to be ashamed of; it's no different from many people being afraid of or disgusted by certain things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight may help them overcome fears based on the unknown or uncontrollable factors.
Courier companies deliver goods quickly in order to receive generous compensation. Time is usually of the essence when transporting business documents, merchandise, or parts for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own planes on some routes, but it's more troublesome for other routes or smaller companies.
If they use air freight to send things, it may take several days to complete unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only way to get it delivered faster is to send the goods as checked baggage. Airlines prohibit checking baggage without a passenger, and that's where your opportunity lies.
The most straightforward way to ride in first class or business class is to pull out a thick stack of bills and enjoy the preferential treatment (another better way is to have the company pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: a rough calculation shows that you'll likely spend four times the economy class price for business class, and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, it's usually futile to try and find business class or first class seat discounts on direct flights from location A to location B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core customer base in the market willing to pay high fees in exchange for being able to reach their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chi»ôinƒÉu. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic plagued by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the emergence of a self-proclaimed state, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, in eastern Moldova. The country has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic links have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a developed, bustling modern commercial center situated on a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and ancient mosques and churches are interspersed among wide, tree-lined boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping malls, giving the city a more Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkish.

Scotturb bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca (Cape Roca).
You can also travel north to visit the extraordinary Sanctuary of F√°tima, a world-renowned site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are actually visiting the site of a mass grave, and this site holds significant meaning for a considerable number of people in the world.
Many men and women who were here at the time survived, and even more had loved ones murdered or worked to death here, regardless of whether they were Jewish or not.
Please treat this site with the appropriate decorum, solemnity, and respect. Never make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Please do not mark or graffiti on the building to avoid damaging the appearance of the attraction.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone understands Spanish.
However, most signs are displayed only in Catalan, as it is the legally designated first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other places.
The fixed announcements in the subway are only in Catalan, but the automated system also unexpectedly interjects in Spanish, English, French, Arabic, Japanese, and other languages.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
While the idea of always putting your best foot forward when living in Paris is often just an inaccurate stereotype, behaving in a "bien √©lev√©" (well-mannered) way will still make it easier for you to navigate social situations.
If you show basic courtesy, Parisians' apparent rudeness will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is lush with forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir trees, blending alpine and Mediterranean vegetation landscapes.
Due to its range of microclimates, diverse soils, and varying elevations, it boasts a remarkably wide and diverse array of plant communities.

That area is home to a rare fauna including European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and grouse, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monastery, women must wear skirts that go past the knee and are not allowed to show their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer wraps for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own (especially brightly colored ones), the monks or nuns at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow from the available stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after every use, so you may feel slightly uncomfortable wearing these skirts. Men's clothing is only available in one size!
Mallorca's cuisine, like other similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and commonly uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner is Pa amb Oli, which is especially popular in the summer: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie" (meaning 'you' in the formal sense), are capitalized, even when they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This might make reading easier, but writing becomes a bit more complicated because you need to confirm whether to use a verb or adjective in the nominalized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, after all, the spelling and pronunciation of most words are exactly the same.
The main letters to pay attention to are 'c' and 'g', because their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: care means dear, while carro means chariot.
Persian grammar is relatively simple and mostly follows fixed rules.
Therefore, reading this grammar introduction will help you learn more Persian grammar and improve your understanding of phrases.

However, someone with a slight understanding of Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is very similar and doesn't require special study.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated today and continue to be used as museums or educational venues.
Because light pollution was not as severe during the heyday of pre-modern observatories, they were often located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than the observatories built today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities, located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as "Hanami," has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China, where the Chinese admire the plum blossom.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom festivals were held exclusively for the Emperor and other nobles in and around the Imperial Palace.
Plants are most beautiful in their natural environment, so please resist the temptation to think "it's okay to pick just one."
When you visit a meticulously arranged garden, collecting "samples" will result in you being evicted with no room for discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to visit, with very convenient transportation, and you can buy almost anything after entering the country.
But because it's located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll need to cope with both (the usual) high temperatures and intense sunlight (a less common occurrence when the sky is clear).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of biblical patriarchs such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes to Hebron, and not just the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.

For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley, take a boat tour of the Danube River's intriguing cities, or canoe along the Erie Canal.
Aqueducts can also form some popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many non-Christians in Christian countries, and non-Christians around the world, have also adopted these holiday traditions.
A traditional Easter custom is to stay awake outdoors all night and watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological interpretations of this tradition, but it is very likely that it was a spring and harvest ritual that existed before the advent of Christianity.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil service on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, and when midnight arrives, the participating faithful celebrate the resurrection of Jesus together.
All the animals that initially came to this island arrived by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to its remote distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to cross the sea, making giant tortoises the primary herbivores of the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans landed on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals, including sheep, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs, have been introduced to the islands.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, meaning the sun will not rise above the horizon.
Because the sky is almost entirely dark all day, it provides an excellent opportunity to view the aurora borealis.
