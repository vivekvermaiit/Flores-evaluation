Within the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control sample, that is, a reference point to which researchers compared the three other treatment methods.
USA Gymnastics expresses its support for the letter issued by the U.S. Olympic Committee and supports the absolute need for Olympic organizers to promote a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that it is in the best interest of our athletes, clubs, and their disciplines to implement meaningful changes within our organization, rather than decertification.

This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides details such as color and three-dimensional arrangement, which cannot be obtained from fossils.
According to scientists, this animal's plumage was chestnut-colored on top and light or carotene-colored underneath.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – scientists have inferred that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than those other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight, but for regulating temperature or for display. Scientists believe this is the plumage of an adult specimen, not a hatchling, even though the tail belonged to a young dinosaur.
Researchers suggested that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the plumage of the specimen indicates an adult individual, not a hatchling.

It turned out that the Sun works just like other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is driven solely by their luminosity and rotation, nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which relates to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the lower the star's activity in terms of magnetic field reversals.

To a large extent, the work was theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations of the galaxy in the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect sought by the team would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon influences the Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert its force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that standard matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter surrounds the galaxy like a kind of halo, composed of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke billowing from the power plant.

Dr. Tony Moll detected extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In the interview, he stated that the new variant was "very problematic and worrying due to the high mortality rate."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers employed at the hospital.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people they have been in close contact with.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among people with tuberculosis still seems low; at any given time in South Africa, there are 6,000 cases out of 330,000 infected.

The government also promised several million vials of encephalitis vaccine to help prepare healthcare facilities for the coming year.
Vaccine delivery plans to areas where the situation has been most difficult so far have been delayed due to lack of funds and low priority compared to other diseases.

They have a lower temperature during the day and a higher temperature at night compared to the surrounding area.
"The thermal environment is not as stable here as in large caves on Earth, where a fairly constant temperature is often maintained, but that's because we're dealing with deep openings here," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff.
In France, voting has typically been a low-tech affair: voters cast their ballots in a booth and place a printed card marked with their chosen candidate into an envelope.
Once officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law defines procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, so that voters and observers have no doubt that there are no envelopes in the ballot box at the time the polling station opens, and that no envelopes are placed in it except those from duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates have the opportunity to send their representatives to observe every stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and in accordance with established procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The following individuals were named as defendants: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector General Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency services extricate the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was placed in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of murdering his son.
She is in custody, awaiting indictment and trial, but the eyewitness testimonies may be unreliable because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, with courts believing that publication of photographs could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are treading on dangerous territory by publishing photos of suspects, etc."
The Office of the Royal Bench, responsible for conducting investigations in general, informed journalists that all further comments are suspended at least until an indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will concern disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to their pre-Six-Day War state in 1967.
According to reports, other topics raised concern the future status of Jerusalem, a holy city for both nations, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA only agrees to such a presence for five years.
Hunters participating in the supplementary pest control test were to be closely supervised by foresters, as the test was being monitored and subject to an effectiveness evaluation.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), skilled volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters' Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, director of protection and heritage at NPSW park, believes that the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which is composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission requested the dissolution of the previous Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to expedite new elections in the country.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were a consequence of the lack of elections, which in some cases had been blocked since 2011.
Over 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods due to overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, classifying them as "minor."
When Apple delayed the release of the report, the ministry called the decision "very unfortunate."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (which is 9:19 PM Universal Time on Friday).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management reported that the country suffered no damage.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A bus carrying tourists from Hong Kong was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by a former Filipino police officer who took the passengers hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with an M16 rifle.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been declared dead.
Filipino photographers and six hostages, including children and seniors, were released earlier.
Later, photographers took the place of the old woman who needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins used his free time to begin researching premature birth.
His research showed that the introduction of the hormone would accelerate lung development in the fetus.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators successfully recovered the black boxes on Wednesday.
Wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the original queen of Extreme. She died on the night of two moons, which was as unique as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was just as crazy as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... one can only hope that she is better now."
Ahead of the 2010 federal election, a survey of 1400 people was conducted, and the percentage of people opposing the introduction of a republic in Australia increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic upon the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents agree with this and want Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme ends of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because he complained about his form, doubts arose regarding his expected performance.
The medications he needed to manage the pain were prohibited by the games' regulations, so he couldn't take them.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
By the beginning of February, several people had confirmed the discovery using different equipment and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is hypothesized that comets delivered water to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, and especially what that process looked like in the case of Earth, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the beginning of this year, and last month ratified a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described these rumors as "political gibberish and nonsense".
Speculation is rife that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would enable airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Using satellite technology instead of older generation radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There will be no additional transport options, Overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and furthermore, car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable in the overground area.
The potential lack of transportation made scenarios more likely in which the match would be held behind closed doors without the participation of the team's fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands, belonging to Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species arose in just two generations, although it was believed that this process takes much longer based on the reproduction of Darwin's finches, including the Large Ground Finch, the Cactus Finch, and the Large-billed Ground Finch.
Gold can be worked into various shapes, even the smallest ones.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be hammered thin and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, called "illuminated manuscripts".
We call it the pH indicator of a chemical substance. Red cabbage juice has the ability to detect pH.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical is.
The pH level indicates the number of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in the abbreviation "pH") contained in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, then, using clean, wet hands, squeeze them together to form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been discovered in homes in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also known in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets sometimes belonged to public baths, where men and women would stay together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away from you, you are using a satellite.
The connection goes to a satellite in outer space, and then almost immediately bounces it back.
A rocket carried the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes placed in outer space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light, and thus the image visible from Earth.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires the use of a massive rocket over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in many incredible ways. First and foremost, it has enabled us to transport things much more easily and quickly.
Without him, there would be no railways, cars, and many other means of transport.
Below are mid-sized cats, feeding on mid-sized prey: rabbits, antelopes, and even deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic ones) that eat far more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in their niche, in a specific task that each cat performs, which prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are among the most sociable cats and live in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions consists of one, two, or three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related, forming one large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides exhibit behavior similar to wolf packs or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in terms of behavior and the deadly threat they pose to their prey.
A tiger, a well-built athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump significant distances, and pull five times better than a strong man.
The tiger, along with the lion, leopard, and jaguar, belongs to the genus Panthera. Only these four species of felines can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't as loud as a lion's, but it sounds more like tangled, shouted words.
Ocelots enjoy eating small animals. When possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Most of the ocelot's prey is much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (for prey) by scent.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and move stealthily. They hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings before pouncing on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (e.g., when moving over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island, without the possibility of easily retreating), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to develop new properties or adapt in such a way as to be able to compete effectively in its new environment.
The original population hasn't changed at all and still has to adapt in the same way.
Over time, as a new population adapts to a new environment, they increasingly resemble other populations less and less.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will differ from each other to such an extent that it will be difficult to call them the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important element of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans release (i.e., exhale).
Photosynthesis is a process in which plants use sunlight to produce nutrients. Plants also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, just like our clothes. Most of our food is also plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the largest predator at the time, so it only feared other mosasaurs.
In his elongated jaws, he had over 70 exceptionally sharp teeth, and additional dentition protruded from the palate, so victims had no chance upon contact with it.
There's no complete certainty, but it may have had a forked tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
He did not shy away from attacking victims in the water, and even a dinosaur as huge as T. rex must have felt respect for him.
Although we are familiar with most of the dishes that the Romans ate, their feasts also featured rather exotic foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and souslik.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting on stools, while the rich met at banquets, during which they ate in a reclining position.
Dishes in ancient Rome could not contain ingredients that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They did not know, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
In Babylonia, each deity had a main temple dedicated to it, which was considered its dwelling.
Sacrifices to deities were offered by people, while the role of priests was to care for the divine needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, behind which was an inner sanctuary, accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were erected as part of temples.
A special sanctuary dedicated to the god was located at the top of the tower.
The house did not play a particularly significant role in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women prepared food in the courtyards, and the shops were just counters opening onto the street. Stones were used to build houses.
Because there were no large forests in Canaan, the price of wood was very high.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for committing murder, and during his voyage west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Without diminishing his role as a discoverer, it must be noted that Eskimo tribes already inhabited the area at that time.
Although every country could be called "Scandinavian", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differ from each other in terms of their peoples, rulers, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there's a map on the back of the Declaration of Independence with directions to a treasure.
That's not true, though. There are some markings on the back of the document, but it's not a map leading to treasure.
On the reverse of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. The inscription is located at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that initially this large parchment document (measuring 29.75 by 24.5 inches) was pierced for storage.
Therefore, it can be assumed that the annotation was added as a descriptive label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south remained occupied.
Power over this area was held by the French "Vichy" government. These were people from France who made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies began an invasion in the south of France, which was called "Operation Dragoon".
Two weeks were enough for the US and Free French forces to liberate southern France and head towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a relatively large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning "civic" or "relating to citizens," which is related to the word "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, which to some extent also indicates the size of the community.
City-states were prototypes of nations. The culture of a civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across many generations, leaving a lasting cultural imprint, and a fair distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a fragile central government – whose sole element was the Congress – based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who were often unwilling to cooperate in enforcing all its laws.
Furthermore, he did not have the authority to overturn regulations and tax rates between states.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all states before any changes could be made, while the states treated the central government with such disregard that their representatives often failed to appear.
Besides the German team, the Italian national football team ranks second in the world football rankings and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and athletes from Italy participate in international tournaments and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island country in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands it possesses, Japan is often called an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
When the Dutch East India Company established a trading post in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, it began implementing changes in indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty troops (1644-1912) seized the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, having suffered defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Within Machu Picchu, three main structures stand out: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
To better illustrate the original appearance of this place to visiting tourists, most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed.
By 1976, one-third of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this process is still ongoing.
For example, in photography, the most commonly used format is 35mm, which was the most widespread film size at the end of the era of analog films.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, this image format has been transferred to sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is quite confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio for this format is 3:2 (obtained by dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio).
Many common formats (e.g., the APS group of formats) are identical to or closely resemble this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds is often overused or ridiculed, but it provides a simple guideline that helps achieve a sense of dynamism without disrupting the order.
It states that the ideal location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photograph into three equal parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, came under close scrutiny.
For over a millennium, the Christian religion provided a vital link between European countries differing in language and customs.
His power was so all-encompassing that it affected everyone, from the king to the peasant.
One of the main tenets of Christianity states that wealth should be used to help the suffering and the poor, and that church funds are to be allocated specifically for this purpose.
The main ecclesiastical authority has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money raises the question of whether this doctrine is being adhered to.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy effectively cut off key military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law enshrined in several international agreements concluded in the previous two centuries.
Great Britain mined areas in international waters to block ships' access to vast areas of the ocean, thereby endangering even neutral vessels.
This tactic met with limited reaction, so the Germans expected a similar situation with their ruthless submarine warfare operations.
The 1920s were characterized by a stance of pacifism and isolationism among most nations and citizens.
After the terrible and cruel experiences of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York.
He set foot on American soil with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods were uniquely represented; each stage in China, or each ruling family, constituted a separate dynasty.
During the interregnum periods between the rule of successive dynasties, provinces were plunged into turmoil and division. The Three Kingdoms period, spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties, is the most famous such period.
Many dignitaries vying for the throne clashed with each other in fierce battles during these periods.
The Three Kingdoms period is recorded in the history of ancient China as a time of great bloodshed; thousands of people died fighting for the highest throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to a single ruler.
After the Revolution as well, all male candidates had free access to professions, allowing those with the greatest ambition and resourcefulness to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as army rankings formerly based on class are now based on the sword.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his ordinary life. He often went to contemplate in a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Mountain of Light).
The cave itself, as it has been preserved, gives a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It's not easy to find her at all, even when someone knows she exists. Inside the cave, absolute isolation awaits the newcomer.
Nothing is visible but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, you can't see or hear much of the outside world.
The only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the 3rd century BCE, is one of many large pyramids erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau (also known as the Giza Necropolis) in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples, and also the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Cheops, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Cheops' wives and relatives.
The "bow up" symbol looks like the letter "V", and the "bow down" symbol looks like a paperclip or a square without its bottom side.
Up-bow means starting at the tip of the bow and pushing it, and down-bow means starting at the frog (the part where the hand holds the bow) and pulling the bow.
Bowing from the bottom up generates a gentler sound, while bowing from the top down produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
Feel free to draw your own markings, but remember that the markings printed on the bow are there for musical reasons, so you should generally stick to them.
A mob of enraged market women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and Elisabeth, the King's sister, to return from Versailles to Paris.
As the king and queen rode in their carriage back to Paris, they were accompanied by a boisterous crowd hurling threats at them.
The enraged mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a person from the crowd brandished the head of a guard killed at Versailles right in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the imperialist United States for the conquest of the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover the greater part of expenses and interest on bonds floated on the stock exchange on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would be the fundamental gains of United States imperialism.
The context in which the Knights Templar order was created is essential to understanding its specific nature.
These events belong to the era commonly known as the Late Middle Ages, which encompassed the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000–1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages, there was the Early Middle Ages, and after it, the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism encompasses a wide range of ideas applied in practice, including technological impetus or technological imperative, as well as the strict definition of human destiny guided by a hidden logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in the realm of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general principles: firstly, the process of technological development itself is not subject to the influence of cultural or political factors, and secondly, technology generates effects in societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
One might say, for example, that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of road networks.
Since a nationwide road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is negligible, new production methods are being developed to reduce vehicle operating costs.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of traffic accidents, and consequently, to the invention of new methods in medicine for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture developed linked to that geography, so harmonious with the society's place that they were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is famous today as the contemporary capital of fashion, so too was Constantinople once considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a haven of luxury originated around 400 AD and lasted until 1000 AD.
His status declined in the 12th century, primarily because returning crusaders brought goods such as silks and spices, which were valued more than what was offered in Byzantine markets.
It was precisely then that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because the exchange of information was slow, Western styles could develop with a delay of 25–30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of that time, resulting from the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming means that a farmer produces enough food to satisfy the needs of themselves and their family.
Subsistence farming represents a simple, often organic system that utilizes seed saving from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively easy methods to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers only met their own needs, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures attract individuals with similar worldviews, individuals who feel that social norms do not meet their needs, and individuals who find a sense of identity within the subculture.
Subcultures differ in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture, setting it apart, can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of various factors.
If someone is a member of a subculture, they show it through a distinctive and symbolic style that encompasses fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most popular ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the rare, unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their upbringing – whether due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate exploitation.
Such children are referred to as "feral" or "wild." Some of them were imprisoned (usually by their parents), and some were abandoned because their parents were unable to come to terms with their child's severe mental or physical disability.
Before abandonment or escape, feral children may have suffered from trauma or abuse.
It is believed that others raised the animals, and some are said to live independently in the wild.
If a feral child is cared for only by animals, it behaves almost entirely (considering physical limitations) like those very animals, exhibiting fear or indifference towards humans.
The project method should facilitate and enhance learning, while scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support provided to individuals who are participating in new educational experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real, meaning that a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, just like Clippy in the MS Office suite.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and are intended to question, suggest, and explain procedures that a student may find challenging to understand independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and even coercion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not provide them with upbringing, care, and education, but unfortunately, it happens.
We believe that the foster care system provides a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is meant to guarantee a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and good medical care.
Foster care is meant to meet all the needs that were not being met in the home from which the child was removed.
The internet can be used for both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific properties of the Internet open up new dimensions in terms of usage patterns and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "contact with others" are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience reactions to websites.
Video recordings have enabled significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial muscle movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly reading their microexpressions.
In the article entitled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks argues that people who, due to brain damage, do not understand speech are nevertheless able to correctly assess the speaker's sincerity.
It even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may also possess such skills in interpreting human behavior.
Scientific research conducted throughout the twentieth century suggests that there are two pools of genetic variation: one hidden and one expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes variation from the pool of expressed genes.
With each generation, there is a reciprocal exchange of variability between the two pools through segregation and recombination.
Plants growing in the savanna make it difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their body's amino acid requirements.
Moreover, failing to do so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest without prior cooking.
It is different with animal food (ants, termites, eggs), which is easily digested and provides large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn't be surprising that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption involves intentionally waking yourself up during your normal sleep and then falling back asleep after 10–60 minutes.
It's not difficult if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores awareness but doesn't fully wake you up.
If you find yourself snoozing the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other methods based on biorhythms recommend consuming a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea, which is diuretic) before falling asleep in order to have to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace is inversely proportional to a person's internal and physical tension.
The less stress there is, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacles are our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but additionally encompasses the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and numerous Indian yoga techniques.
Tibetan Buddhism is fundamentally very simple. It encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga awakens the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through the practice of asanas, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
In the Tibetan meditation center, there is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
During World War II, the USA and the USSR allied against a common enemy, which was Germany. However, when the war came to an end, the radical clash of systems, processes, and cultures alienated these two countries.
Two years had passed since the end of the war when former allies became enemies, marking the beginning of the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years and involve real battles fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had already been broken, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans quickly became irrelevant when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, thereby violating the provisions of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ships is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and people across oceans.
The navy's task has always been to ensure the country's ability to transport people and goods, while simultaneously preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II was one of the most outstanding examples in recent history. To help the British, the Americans attempted to transport people and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, tried to blockade these transfers.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Great Britain, just as it had the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats likely occurred in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
People belonging to ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for their milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often guarded by goatherds similar to shepherds, who were usually children or teenagers. These farming methods are still used.
Railway tracks were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Even though the tracks were built only of parallel wooden planks, draft horses could move faster and transport larger loads on them than on the bumpy roads of the time.
Railway sleepers, on which rails were fixed, appeared relatively early. Gradually, however, it was understood that in order to increase the efficiency of the tracks, iron strips should be mounted on them.
This became a popular practice, but the iron contributed to increased wear and tear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago, hence the term Homo Erectus (upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedalism can be found in the fossils of australopithecines dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even take on the role of activists, to contribute to reducing the scale of suffering in the future to some extent.
It often resembles symptomatic treatment. However, in order not to be limited to a temporary solution, the source of the problems must be identified and eliminated.
It is obvious that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technical progress, and due to overpopulation and an extravagant lifestyle, the problems have worsened.
When the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten version, signed by John Hancock, President of the Congress, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed at night, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
John Nixon first read the document publicly in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who ordered it to be read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 still-existing Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten original did not survive.
Many paleontologists claim that one group of dinosaurs survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many things in birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs, just like a T-Rex.
Actually, all computers currently in use rely on manipulating information encoded as a binary system.
A binary number can have a value of 0 or 1, and these types of numbers are known as binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning doesn't necessarily manifest immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough that they don't provide a basis for an immediate diagnosis.
The presence of open packaging of medications or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of poisoning.
Refer to the label instructions to learn how to administer first aid in the event of this specific poisoning.
The name "robak" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient times, when bedbugs were common, being insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or home of a host.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis have been registered, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
According to the results of conducted research, the risk of multiple sclerosis is twice as high in women as in men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, nor in the child's.
These couples can decide to make an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption involves the biological parents relinquishing their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal that science sets for itself is to discover the mechanism of how the world works using the scientific method. The majority of scientific research is based on this method.
However, this is not the only method; an experiment is a test that allows one to reject one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Classical texts, especially the Latin translation of the Bible, formed the basis of studies conducted by naturalists and philosophers.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the West became cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend fundamentally on the existence of endogenous cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms that are not merely reactions to external periodic stimuli have been documented in the majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that persist through entire cycles, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject bacteria with their own DNA.
Two experiments were conducted, one labeling phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the other labeling phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on their type, the importance of the genetic material element affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children; mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts individuals interested in exploring natural areas, admiring landscapes, including vegetation and wildlife.
Sample on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visits to parks and gathering information about the ecosystem.
An example could be visiting Borneo, photographing, and gathering information about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave their small towns in cars and head to work, passing those who are traveling to the places they have just left.
Within this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone somehow participates in and supports the transport system based on private vehicles.
Currently, science indicates that a massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from its stable state, which supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed countries, one rarely hears such complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why are there irregularities in their functioning every day? Are the engineers responsible for them just incompetent? Or does the problem lie much deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the interactions that occur between them.
It is impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty, so unfortunately, studying traffic flow presents difficulties.
Fortunately, driver behavior falls within a generally consistent range; therefore, traffic flows also exhibit some consistency and can be approximately represented by mathematical calculations.
The relationships between three key properties—(1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed—allow for a better understanding of traffic flow.
Planning, designing, and operating road facilities utilize this type of relationship.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. The ability to fly allowed them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects possess the useful ability to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are among the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
There were those who believed he was right, while others held the opposite view, namely that the solar system, along with the Sun and other stars, revolves around the Earth.
That makes sense, because after all, the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest river in the world, and at the same time, the largest. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, and in places it is nearly 6 miles wide.
The Amazon is responsible for 20% of the river water that flows into the Earth's oceans.
The Amazon River in its main course is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of small tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked with awe at the structures of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The majority of people working in this country use Italian on a daily basis, while Latin can often be heard during religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
As early as antiquity, people knew basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they occur in nature in their natural form and can be relatively easily extracted using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is a combination of at least one to four elements. These were: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized about them transforming into new substances that shape what we see.
An alloy can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals. It should be remembered that the periodic table contains many elements.
Calcium and potassium are elements considered to be metals. Of course, silver and gold are also classified as metals.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so unimaginably microscopic that a dot at the end of this sentence could hold trillions of them.
So, when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the pencil has lost its status and frequency of use.
People now write messages using computer screens and don't need pencil sharpeners at all.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Nuclear fission releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that decay with a slight disturbance or even without one.
The surface of the Moon is covered in rocks and dust. The outer layer of a planet is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more mare regions on the near side, because the crust is thinner there, making it easier for lava to break through to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what resonates with people and appeals to them.
These theories assume that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been acquired in the process of maturing into adulthood.
These theories relate to what makes some people want to do the things they do, and what in their environment causes them to do certain things while others don't.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start leading their former colleagues, two types of behavior can occur. One of these is trying to remain "one of the gang" (or one of the team).
This type of manager is reluctant to make unpopular decisions, avoids disciplinary actions, and shies away from performance reviews, task assignment, and holding people accountable for their work.
The other extreme is an unrecognizable transformation into someone who feels they must change everything the team has done so far, subordinating it to their own vision.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the successes and failures of the team in the final analysis.
Such behavior often results in friction between leaders and the remaining team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for a directly associated physical group.
They often have more freedom than regular team members because their teams can organize meetings according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
"The invisible group" is a management team to which all members report. The invisible group sets standards for each member.
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing the learning organization concept is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity flourish when all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, collaboration within the organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to the creation of an innovative process that meets customer needs.
For an organization to become innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that helps organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This narrows the field of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports ongoing research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, trauma, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in mental function.
Thanks to new technologies, we can observe and study previously unknown brain structures and the processes occurring within them.
We draw a lot of information and materials from here to build simulation models that allow us to better understand what is happening in the human mind.
Although artificial intelligence is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research focuses on building machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include: control and planning, the ability to respond to customer statements and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things became separate fields, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are frequently used today in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military technology, and also appear as an embedded component in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an essential part of any class. Often, a teacher would love to take her students to places that buses don't reach.
Technology offers the possibility of virtual field trips. Students can view museum collections, visit an aquarium, or admire works of art while sitting in their classroom.
By offering a virtual field trip, you can stimulate reflection on it and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is changed every year, but the old versions remain online as an album.
Blogs can help students improve their writing. Often, at the beginning of blogging, grammar and spelling aren't top-notch, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
The blogger is starting to make efforts to improve the quality of their writing and avoid criticism, as students often deliver the harshest judgments.
Furthermore, blogging "makes students more aware of the world around them." The need to respond to audience interests inspires students to offer intelligent and engaging content (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Thanks to the proper use of blogs, "students can become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online posts, they can define their position in relation to the work of others and outline their own perspective on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, with many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls lies to the south of here, while to the north, you can discover the pristine beauty of the Muskoka region and its surrounding areas.
All these things – and more – clearly indicate that Ontario is considered by outsiders to be the quintessential Canada.
Vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them practically deserted wilderness.
This population comparison surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, east of the coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest, and due to its nature, it constitutes a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or allied with France, and are famous as luxurious seaside resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which definitely took hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism emerged in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that every woman traveling should present herself as married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behaviors they perceive as harassment, such as being followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Firmly refuse men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't mean that's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and served as a strategic port called Anfa for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned them after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badya, and Spanish merchants, who had trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is the worst place in all of Morocco.
Within the old Medina, you can easily buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a plethora of various trinkets, but this offer is typically aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the easternmost part of the country near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted and lava buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside of its area should be investigated beforehand for the state of fighting ongoing in the North Kivu province.
From the city, you can embark on a climb up the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as go tracking mountain gorillas, which is one of the most affordable options for this activity in Africa here.
Motorcycle taxis (known as boda-bodas) can be used to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short trip will cost around 500 Congolese francs.
In light of its relatively inaccessible location, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, yet its reputation attracts tourists, and there's also an airport there.
In 1990, the city was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to damage caused by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' special PBS program, "Africa's Great Civilizations."
This city definitely differs from the rest of the cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic than an African climate.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forming its southern boundary.
The park's area covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each characterized by different flora and fauna.
It is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Daily conservation and park entry fees are applicable here, as in all other South African National Parks.
Purchasing a Wild Card can be advantageous as it grants access to select parks in South Africa or to all national parks in the RSA.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from Hong Kong Island, which is a major attraction for many tourists.
The compact rows of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline have been likened to a gleaming bar graph accentuated by the surface of Victoria Harbour.
The best views of Hong Kong are from the Kowloon waterfront, opposite the city.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonizers, so it's a good place to start looking for traces of this territory's colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest single block of tidal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in India is called Sundarban National Park.
However, forests are not just mangrove swamps – they are also the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans have an area of 3850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water and swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that it is now home to 400 royal Bengal tigers and roughly 30,000 chital deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang.
It's better to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as buses running between districts are often crowded.
Most districts are served by small Japanese waterfront buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient mode of transport to nearby locations, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that provides communication between the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes, each 3.5 meters wide.
The bridge's vertical clearance is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to plan, the bridge will be ready for use in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs posts is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in the region of present-day eastern Paraguay, leading the life of semi-nomadic hunters and practicing agriculture for their own needs.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "great province of the Indies," emerged in the 16th century as a result of the clash between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In other months, you can also find tournaments and competitions organized on a smaller scale.
The Asociacion Argentina de Polo Association offers more information about the games and tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Throughout the islands, British pounds are generally accepted, credit cards can be used in Stanley, and US dollars can often be used as well.
Don't count on using a card for payment when staying on the most remote islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; it's best to ask the owners in advance about the form of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you should exchange your money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer prevails there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, which means that temperatures often exceed +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be colder than it seems: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but combined with wind and humidity, the perceived cold is greater than what the thermometer shows.
There are no "dry" and "rainy" seasons; the amount of precipitation is essentially the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park have become accustomed to seeing people, they are still wild, so you must not feed or disturb them.
Park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
Although they may look gentle, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a safe distance. These are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals that need space.
Furthermore, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and inhabited by just under 40,000 people.
The city of Apia was founded in the 1850s, and it became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
It was here that the infamous naval standoff of 1889 occurred, when seven warships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave port.
All ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence, which was organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city ended with the killing of the main leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland stretches between two harbours, so there are plenty of beaches here, and the most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy, with safe swimming areas, and metrosideros trees provide shade on most of them.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are often crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops lining the waterfront, and swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," which isn't a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is "Manta."
It's worth stocking up on various French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may withstand the journey better.
You can drink tap water here without any worries, but if anyone has doubts, bottled water is readily available.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of a "flat white." A small black coffee is an "espresso," a cappuccino is filled to the brim with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices cost quite a bit, but they are exquisite.
Many reef trips operate year-round, and injuries on the reef caused by any of these reasons are rare.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of this period as well.
No one denies the existence of sharks, but their attacks on humans are rare. Most of these creatures feel fear when encountering humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead active lives in the oceans; their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance ensures that travelers don't have to worry about having a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies usually collaborate with specific hotels, although it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers (to and from the airport), as well as combined flight and hotel deals.
Your reservation can be extended if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents required at your destination (e.g., visas).
Any corrections or requests should be directed to the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
In the case of music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on site, most of whom consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
It should be remembered that even after the musical performances on the main stages have finished, music will continue to play in some festival areas until late at night.
Some festivals offer camping areas specifically for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as traveling through ice generates terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises around St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise ship passengers are visa-free (conditions apply).
Casinos usually aim to keep their guests for as long as possible and for them to spend as much money as possible. Hence the lack of windows and clocks, and the exit is hard to find.
They usually have special offers including meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but intoxication impairs judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know the value of a sober mind.
When driving in high latitude areas or over mountain passes, conditions such as snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures should be taken into account.
On roads covered with ice and snow, there is little friction, so you can't drive like you would on clear asphalt.
When a blizzard rages, so much snow can fall very quickly that the road can become impassable.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by droplets or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, where traffic flows without major disruptions throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important event for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to overland journeys undertaken to admire the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles closely, and the standard equipment will allow for proper viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be skittish, so it's best to observe them through binoculars.
A walking safari (or "bush walk") can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24th and last until September 5th, 2012. Some events will be hosted by other locations within Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice (the first time was in 1964).
If you booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the date change was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellations do not cover July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to take place.
As expected, most event tickets will range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing can speed up the drying of damp clothes. Many hotels rent out irons and ironing boards if they are not included in the room's amenities.
If you don't have an iron or don't mind wearing unironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
The fabric must not be subjected to excessive heating, as it may shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
Water can be purified in many ways, and some of them are more effective at combating specific threats.
Depending on the area, it is enough to boil the water for a minute, or several minutes may be needed.
Filters have varying levels of effectiveness, so if you have concerns, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that are not found in their native lands.
Pests destroy food, cause irritations or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, secrete venom, and transmit infections.
Usually, infectious diseases as such, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping offers the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in designated locations.
Travelers visiting countries with particularly high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the most challenging section for drivers lies between Point Marion and Fairmont, often cutting through remote forest areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes peeled, because you'll often encounter steep inclines, narrow sections, and sharp turns.
Posted speed limits are significantly lower than those on preceding and subsequent sections (typically 35–40 mph, or 56–64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is exceptionally important.
Interestingly, the cell phone signal is significantly stronger here than on many other sections of this route, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds region.
German pastries are quite tasty, and the Bavarian ones stand out for their nutritional value and variety, similar to Austria, which borders Bavaria on the southern side.
Fruit pastries are very popular: with cooked apples available year-round, and with cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German baked goods include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular pastries often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but nutritious dish, try this, which depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is a common addition to curry dishes, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
With as many as 17,000 islands, the term Indonesian cuisine encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
This term, without further clarifying qualifications, usually refers to cuisine typical of the central and eastern regions of Java, which is the most important island in the region.
Javanese cuisine, now easily accessible throughout the archipelago, encompasses simply seasoned dishes, and Javanese favorites include peanuts, chili peppers, and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet that hang on each side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the fleeing horse can drag them. Various safety measures can be taken to minimize the risk of such an event.
Above all, most jockeys wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English saddles, are equipped with safety mechanisms that cause the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if a rider falling backwards pulls on them.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing location, referred to as the Yosemite of South America, offering a diversity of large granite walls and towers.
Spectacular views unfold from the peaks. Climbers from all over the globe continue to forge new routes among the walls, which offer countless possibilities.
Winter sports such as downhill skiing or snowboarding are popular sports that involve descending snowy terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity on trips for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "skiing fanatics," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular place.
Skiing has a very long history - as early as 5000 BC, silhouettes of skiers were painted on cave walls!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski touring.
One can notice some similarities to alpine skiing and climbing, however, unlike them, the route does not go through steep terrain and sturdier skis and boots are not needed.
Think of a ski run like you would a similar hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you'll be able to cover slightly longer distances than when hiking, but you'll only reach running speeds in rare cases, and only if you're without a heavy backpack and the route is properly prepared.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to apply for many visas and go through numerous passport controls.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to some extent like a single country.
As long as you remain within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, which saves time and money and reduces formalities.
There is no single, universal definition determining which human-made objects should be considered antiques. Some tax agencies consider any object over 100 years old to be an antique.
This definition depends on geographical location; the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be called antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Many Sami people depend on reindeer herding for their livelihoods, and the culture associated with this industry is also important for people in other professions.
The traditional occupation that the Sami people engaged in and still engage in is not only large-scale reindeer herding, but also fishing, hunting, etc., with reindeer primarily serving as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern sectors. Tourism is an important branch of the economy in Lapland, which is inhabited by the Sami.
The word "Gypsy" is commonly heard, especially among people who are not Roma themselves, but it is often considered offensive because it evokes associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma people.
If the country you are traveling to has travel regulations in place, this will affect your health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.

When planning a trip to a country considered a war zone, it is necessary to undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for "Hostile Environment Training Course" will likely lead you to the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here, in much more detail and combined with practical exercises.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing exercises, extensive first aid training, and sometimes also weapons training.
Numerous books and magazines on the subject of survival are widely available, while publications concerning war zones are very few.
Individuals planning gender confirmation surgery abroad must have valid travel documents for their return journey.
Governments have different approaches to issuing passports without gender specification (X) or updating names and gender in documents according to the wishes of the individuals concerned.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is equally varied.
Furthermore, security screeners began conducting much more rigorous searches after September 11, 2001.
Before surgery, transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will not be violated during scans.
Rip currents are formed by waves breaking on a beach, reef, or similar barrier.
Underwater topography causes the return flow to occur mainly at a few deeper levels, where a rapid current directed towards deep water can form.
Most often, death occurs due to exhaustion caused by trying to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
Once you manage to get out of the current, swimming back shouldn't be more difficult than usual.
Try to head towards a place where you won't get caught in the current again, or wait for rescue, considering your abilities and whether someone has noticed you.
Reverse culture shock comes on faster than culture shock (the "honeymoon" period is shorter), lasts longer, and can have more serious consequences.
Tourists who adapted to a new culture without problems sometimes find it exceptionally difficult to readjust to their native culture.
Returning home after living abroad, you're used to a new culture and have shed some of the habits associated with your national culture.
During your first trips abroad, people probably treated you with patience and understanding, knowing that a traveler arriving in a foreign country must adapt.
People often don't anticipate that travelers returning home also need to show patience and understanding.
The sound and light show on the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions for kids in the area.
You can see the pyramids at dusk and in silence, before the show begins.
Usually, you can constantly hear the sounds of tourists and vendors here. The story told through sound and light is like a fairytale book.
The Sphinx serves as both the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are subject to claims by several countries and have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, has the largest area of all.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where a water-filled caldera of a still-active volcano forms a picturesque natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located north of the Peninsula and is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merge into a plateau, before rising again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range lies the Vinson Massif, the highest mountain range in Antarctica, with the highest peak reaching a height of 4892 m.
In remote locations where there is no mobile phone service, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot replace a mobile phone because you need to go outside and have good visibility of the satellite to connect.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational boating, and during expeditions requiring remote data and voice services.
Your local telecommunications provider should provide more information about this service.
Among people planning a gap year, travel and educational options are becoming increasingly popular.
This is a popular option among school graduates, giving them the opportunity to take a gap year before starting their studies without any detriment to their education.
Often, participating in a year-long course abroad can significantly improve the chances of obtaining higher education in one's home country.
Enrolling in these educational programs usually involves paying a tuition fee.
Finland offers ideal conditions for boat holidays. This "land of a thousand lakes" also abounds in islands, of which there are thousands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
A yacht is not necessarily required in archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are suitably large for all yachts, smaller boats or even kayaks offer different experiences.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with about one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand have a similar statistical indicator, but it is still an exceptional result compared to countries such as the Netherlands, where there is one boat for every forty citizens.
An extended stay in Saint Petersburg is on the itinerary of most Baltic cruise tours.
That means you can explore the historic city for a few days and return to the ship at night.
If you only go ashore during cruise excursions, you do not need a separate visa (situation as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin in their itinerary. The map above clearly shows that Berlin is not located on or near the sea, so a visit to this city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a terrible experience for people of all ages, especially if they haven't flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There's no need to be ashamed of it: it's no different from the fears and antipathies typical of many people.
Some people are able to overcome their fear of the unknown or lack of control if they learn the principles of how an airplane works and the mechanisms related to flight.
Courier companies make good money on fast deliveries. Often, time plays a crucial role when it comes to business documentation or goods and spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but this was problematic with respect to other routes and smaller companies.
If they were sending parcels by air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take many days on some routes.
The only way to send it faster is to check it as baggage. According to airline regulations, luggage cannot be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a significant amount of money for the privilege (or – even better – have a company pay for it for you).
However, this is a costly option: generally, a business class ticket will cost four times more than a standard economy class ticket, and a first class ticket as much as eleven times more!
Generally, it's not worth wasting time searching for discounts on business or first class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain consistent group of travelers who are willing to pay any amount to arrive at their destination quickly and comfortably, and they take this into account when setting prices.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova, where the local language is Romanian, although Russian is also in common use.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic experiencing conflicts based on ethnicity.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but it is not recognized by UN member states.
Despite the unsuccessful political negotiations, economic ties were restored between the two parts of Moldova.
Orthodoxy is the dominant religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It is also the second largest port, after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
It was once the ancient city of Smyrna, and is now a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center built around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glazed building facades, and modern shopping malls coexist with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market square, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík, you can see the nearby island of Eysturoy, and there is an unusual octagonal church there.

The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs only have a Catalan version because, by law, it is the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also frequently used in public transport and other places.
Regular announcements in the metro are given exclusively in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are broadcast by an automated system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are considered to be egocentric, boorish, and conceited.

We can find rare animal species there, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must have their knees and shoulders covered.
In most monasteries, women who are inappropriately dressed are given a headscarf, but it's worth having your own, especially a brightly colored one, to see a smile on the face of a monk or nun at the entrance to the temple.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
Men can also borrow knee-covering wraps at the entrance, but they are not washed regularly, so not everyone will feel comfortable wearing one. One size fits all for men!
The basis of Majorcan cuisine, as in other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), as well as olive oil.
A simple, popular supper, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns are capitalized, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence, including the word "Sie," which is a polite form of address meaning "Sir/Madam/You."
This is an important method for distinguishing certain predicates from complements.
It can be considered that this also makes reading easier, although difficulties arise when writing, because it is necessary to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in a noun form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple – most words are pronounced as they are written.
Particular attention should be paid to the letters "c" and "g" because they are pronounced differently depending on the vowel that follows them.

Pre-modern observatories are now outdated and are being converted into museums or educational centers.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem in their heyday as it is now, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous devices located in remote places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The custom of contemplating cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The idea originated in China, where plum blossoms were most popular.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first cherry blossom viewing parties exclusively for himself and other aristocrats from the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural habitat, so don't give in to the temptation to pick "just one" specimen.
When visiting a formal garden, do not collect "specimens," as this will also result in immediate expulsion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
Being in the tropics just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear - less often).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives, are buried.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good idea for a vacation.
For example, visiting the châteaux of the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or a trip to interesting cities along the Danube, or a cruise on the Erie Canal.

Christmas, commemorating the birth of Jesus, is one of the most important Christian holidays.
Also, non-believers in Christian countries and people of other faiths around the world have incorporated into their lives many traditions that have grown up around these holidays.
According to some traditions, Easter night is spent watching in an open space, waiting for the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as easily be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Churches with a more traditional approach celebrate the Easter Vigil liturgy in the evening on Holy Saturday, and the faithful often begin to celebrate the resurrection of Christ when the clock strikes midnight.
All the animals that were the first to arrive on the island came here by swimming, flying, or drifting on the water.
The distance from the continent was so great that mammals were unable to reach it, which led to the giant tortoise becoming the primary species living in the Galapagos.
As soon as humans arrived in the Galapagos, numerous mammals appeared there, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.

Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than the work culture that Westerners are accustomed to.
A suit is standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial and emphasizes team effort rather than individual achievements.
