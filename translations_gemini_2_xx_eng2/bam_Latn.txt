It only reinforces the idea that some dinosaurs had feathers, an argument that has been going on for a long time, and it offers explanations that nothing else could offer effectively, such as species and how they were geographically distributed.
Researchers say that this food coloring was previously based on turmeric and annatto or carotenoid extracts.
This preliminary research aims to better understand the perception of progress in rural communities.
Fossil dinosaur bones are very old; this is called fossilization. There are different methods of fossilization, and paleontologists understand that fossils are very old because of their altered composition.
The constraint of limited lifespan can lead people to think that they didn't have the time to create artwork, develop technologies, or demonstrate them. Researchers have demonstrated that even if a dinosaur died young, the specimen still displays its complete lifespan in an undeniable way.
Some researchers suggest that, even if the dinosaur is large, this species likely has a small brain rather than a large one.
