This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but is also able to show sufficient fossil detail, such as color and 3-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists stated that the animal's fur was chestnut brown on top but pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
The finding provides insight into changes in bird plumage.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possessed other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The feather structure indicates it was not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that, even though this is a young dinosaur's tail, this specimen shows mature feathers that are not chicken-like.
Researchers suggest that, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult feathers and not juvenile ones.

The completed work is mostly just theory, but the program was created to simulate research conducted on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team will be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of that galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Like the moon exerting a gravitational pull on Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy exists around that galaxy in a spherical halo, and is made up of many small particles.

Candidates may send representatives to witness each step of the process. Furthermore, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific rules.

He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with murdering her son.
He is being detained and awaiting charges and trial, but the eyewitness evidence is somewhat tainted because his image has been widely publicized.
This is usually done elsewhere in England, but the Scottish courts operate differently and the court considers the publication of photos potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted "journalists are likely walking a dangerous line when publishing photos of suspects etc."
The Attorney General's Office, which is responsible for the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that there will be no further comment until an indictment.
According to leaked news, the document will concern the country's border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered in the report also include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded to continue its military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement was signed, while the PA agreed to leave the military presence for only five years.
The shooter in the supplemental pest control trial must be closely supervised by a guard, because the trial is being monitored and its effectiveness is being assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., volunteers meeting the criteria are recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director of Parks and Heritage Protection and NOWS, the 4 shooters who have been selected for the first shooting operation have received safety briefings and have also been trained.
Martelly appointed a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is CEP candidate Martelly's fifth in 4 years.
Last month the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP beforehand as part of a package of measures to advance the state in the new elections.
The commission is Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests in October.
The protests, sometimes accompanied by violence, were triggered by the failure to hold general elections, some of which have been since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods overheating and not turning on have been reported, resulting in a total of six burns and causing four people to suffer minor burn injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it is aware of 27 incidents related to the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported additional thermal incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by saying that Apple's report delay was "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas' emergency management office says there have been no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first, along with a Filipina photographer.
The photographers replaced an old woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza died from being shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied to become an obstetrician and then started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
The research shows that if given hormones, it will accelerate the lung maturation of the baby's fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorder 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Luna's wrestling friends also paid their respects.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of extreme. My first boss. Luna passed away on a two-month night. Unique as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as me... maybe even more so... loved her and will miss her terribly... hope you are in a better place."
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent from 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia would become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of people in the poll hold this opinion, which is wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of people surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, their physical fitness is questionable.
He/She cannot take the necessary medication to cope with the pain because it is banned at the Competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people have confirmed the discovery using both hard and soft devices differently since early February. It was distributed on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to know how planets initially formed, especially how Earth formed, since a comet struck Earth in the past.
Suomo, 53 years old, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumor "gossip and political shenanigans".
He was rumored to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the FAA that can fly aircraft with shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and cutting carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology, which is the opposite of older land-based radar technology, to manage air traffic by showing the position of aircraft more clearly and providing more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no more connecting transport available, and the overground train will not stop at Wembley. Also, car parking and the shuttle service are unavailable at the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation increase the likelihood that the match will be forced to be held behind closed doors without the support of team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported a new species that evolved in just two generations, even though this process usually takes a long time, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed into all sorts of shapes. It can also be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be spun and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made thinner, then attached to other metals. This can be made so thin that it can almost be used for decorating hand-painted images in books, or what are called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called pH in chemistry. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemicals in it are.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (because a hydrogen atom originally consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, using clean but damp hands, squeeze until it forms a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel itchy and form a small shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated sewage disposal system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in settlements in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were found in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman Civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were placed in the same area.
When you contact someone who is very far away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive phone calls and then quickly send those calls back down to Earth.
The satellite was sent to outer space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to put satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The greatest thing that the wheel has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
This has led us to discover trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
Below that is a medium-sized cat that eats medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including pet cats) are eating more small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is a niche concept, a specific job that cats have, which keeps them away from competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult males, and around thirty females and their young.
Women usually have close relationships with each other, often in the form of large families of sisters and daughters.
The pride of lions is not much different from a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and just as dangerous to their prey.
An athlete with vast knowledge, a tiger that can climb (though not well), swim, jump far, and pull with 5 times the strength of a strong person.
Tigers belong to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as powerful as a lion's roar, but more similar to a leopard's soft roar.
Ocelots like to prey on small animals. They will eat monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals preyed upon by ocelots are smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt other animals for food by using their sense of smell, smelling the soil where those other animals have passed.
The animal can see clearly in the dark using night vision, and can also stalk very slowly. The ocelot hunts its prey by blending into its surroundings and then ambushing it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from their origin (such as moving across a mountain or river, or if moving to a new island so that it is not easy to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different enemies, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than the old one.
The original population will not change at all; they still require the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to acclimate to the new environment, they appear likely to continue to decline like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations would look so different that they could no longer be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and the most important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed by humans, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, humans breathe out).
Plants process their food with the help of sunlight through photosynthesis. Plants also provide shade.
We build houses and sew clothes from plants. Almost all the food we eat also comes from plants. If there were no plants, animals could not live.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, it feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
Its length is lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there's no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We don't know for sure, but its tongue was probably forked. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly even cannibalism.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even dinosaurs like T. rex were no match.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had strange or unusual foods at celebrations, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and rodents called dormice.
Another difference is that poor people and women eat while sitting on chairs, while the rich like to hold feasts together where they will recline while eating.
Ancient Roman food could not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in the centuries that followed.
As an example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, coconuts, and then no ancient Roman had ever tried turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god and considered it the god's home.
The people will offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests will strive to fulfill the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and a sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Sometimes several towers that have a pyramid-like shape are called ziggurats. Ziggurats were built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower is a special place for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not that important to them.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The wife cooks in the yard; the shops are just counters facing the street. Stones are used to build houses.
Originally, there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the price of wood was very expensive.
Greenland was uninhabited. Nordic sagas tell that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and then, when traveling west, he discovered Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But aside from his discovery, the Eskimo people had already settled in that place since that time.
Although each country is called 'Scandinavia', there are many differences between the societies, royalty, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not correct. Even though there's writing on the back of the document, it's not a property map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence Dated July 4, 1776." The text appears on the bottom of the document, inverted.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled for suspension.
So, it seems that notation was added only as a label.
The D-Day landings and other battles successfully liberated northern France, but the southern part was not yet.
Ruled by "Vichy" France. They were French people who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, an attack that was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and then they returned to Germany.
Civilization is a culture that belongs to a group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil, related to the Latin word "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and somehow the meaning of this can be defined as how much the society is within it.
A city-state is a pioneer of the nation. Civilized culture implies the continuation of knowledge for generations, cultural heritage, and fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often perish without leaving behind associated historical evidence and fail to be recognized as worthy civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak first central government—with Congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and with no national executive or judiciary, it was dependent on the authority of the states, which were often uncooperative, to enforce any of its acts.
That also doesn't have the power to deviate from tax regulations and interstate fees.
These clauses require absolute approval from all member states before they can be amended, and the member states often disregard the central government, so their representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are two of the most successful national teams in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in northern regions, and Italy participates in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because of its archipelago / island group nature, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical sense, as "the archipelago".
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and noted the island's name as Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which began to change indigenous grain production practices and employ Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seized the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan to be one of the provinces of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of 3 main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the original appearance was like.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been restored and continues to be improved until now.
For example, a very common photography format in the world is the one with a size of 35 mm. This is a dominant film size very similar to the analog film era.
It is still being made until now, but the most important thing is that the aspect ratio has been inherited from the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, because it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this shape (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is supposedly 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS format and others) are the same or similar to this aspect ratio.
A very torturous and often ridiculed rule is a simple guideline in creating dynamism while maintaining proportion in a picture.
This states that the best place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was closely watched.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European countries despite their different languages and customs.
His encompassing power includes everyone from the king to the common people.
A core Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's finances exist for that reason.
The central authority of the church has been centered in Rome for over a thousand years. This concentration of power and money has raised many questions about its teachings.
Immediately after the outbreak of war, Britain announced a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, halting vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated widely accepted International Law codified by several International treaties over the past 2 centuries.
Britain deployed mines in its waters to block other ships from entering its territory, which could cause destruction for them as well as for neutral ships.
Because the response was limited by this tactic, Germany expected the same response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the attitude still held by many citizens was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horror and brutality of war during World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing historical periods, with each stage of China or each ruling family being a different dynasty.
Each dynasty also had periods of instability, divided into several provinces. The most famous period of this era was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During this period, a fierce war occurred between many nobles to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, colonization was open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to prosper.
The same thing also applies to the military because instead of ranks being sorted by class, they are now measured according to ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many workers from other countries to start their own changes.
Muhammad was very fond of all things unusual in worldly life. He often came to a cave now called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, offers a glimpse into Muhammad's spiritual path.
Located on one of the northern peaks of Mecca, this cave is very isolated from the outside world.
The truth is, it's not easy to find at all, even though there's 1 person who knows about it. Once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
Nothing could be seen except for the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains all around. Very little of this world could be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the 7 wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures ever built to honor the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or what is called the "Giza Necropolis," located within the Egyptian Plateau of Corpses, is largely filled with pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small tombstones, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arrow up" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "arrow down" symbol looks like a stack or a square that has lost its bottom side.
Upwards means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and downwards means you should start at the bottom (where your hand is holding the bow) and then pull the bow.
Stroking upwards usually produces a soft, gentle sound, while stroking downwards produces a loud, distinct sound.
Feel free to draw your own features, but remember, the curved features that have been printed exist because of music, so they should usually be appreciated.
The fearful King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, his two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
In the carriage, they journeyed back to Paris surrounded by a mob of screaming people shouting threats at the King and Queen.
A mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
Once upon a time, one of the members of the mob displayed the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The cost of the US imperialist war to conquer the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will become a basic profit for United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must first understand the context that supported the creation of the order.
This period of events is usually called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, based on scholarship, ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas in practice, from technological impulse or technology as a cause to the strong feeling that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development itself follows a path that is largely unaffected by culture or politics, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on the public that are always constant, rather than socially contingent.
For example, someone might say that cars are necessary for road development.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new methods in their production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn drives the discovery of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged car bodies.
Romanticism has a broad element of cultural determinism, as exemplified by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual. And eventually, customs and culture that are related to this geography arise, so all the things mentioned earlier are more in line with the place of the community, better than laws that are arbitrarily enforced.
Paris is known as the fashion capital for contemporary modern, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital for feudal Europe.
This was known as a center of luxury from around 400 AD until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusades had returned with prizes such as silk and spices that were valued more greatly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
This very moment is when the transfer of the Fashion Capital title from Constantinople to Paris is happening.
The peak of the Gothic style was between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, strong clothing was influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because their communication channels are slow, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Facing the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments was that people started using buttons to quickly dress themselves.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is carried out to produce food that is only enough to meet the basic needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native, saved seeds from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have made farming their livelihood, and this is still common in developing countries.
Subcultures foster like-minded people who feel ignored by societal standards and empower a sense of self.
Subcultures are distinguished depending on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often display their membership through distinctive and symbolic styles, encompassing dress, behavior, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use several cases of unfortunate children who, through neglect, deprivation, or deliberate cruelty, are not socialized by adults during their formative years.
A child who is like that is called "liar" (wild) or *lingas*. Many *lingas* children are often scolded by others (usually their own parents); in some cases, children like this are neglected because their parents do not accept the child's shortcomings in terms of intelligence or their imperfect physical condition.
Street children have already experienced abuse and trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are suspected of having been raised by animals; some say they live in the wild on their own.
When raised by animals rather than people, feral children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
If project-based learning is to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding should be built further in advance.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather assistance that provides support for individuals undergoing new experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Frameworks can be virtual or real. A teacher is a type of framework, but so is the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
The Virtual Scaffold is internalized in the software and intended to question, prompt, and explain procedures that are difficult for students if done on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages for various reasons, ranging from abandonment, abuse, to experiencing sexual violence.
Ideally, no child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care for, and educate them, but the reality is that it exists.
We consider the Foster Care System to be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The orphanage should provide all the necessities that were lacking at home before they were taken in.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristic of the Internet gives rise to an additional dimension in terms of usage and modes of gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are recommended as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) considered "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as things that create enthusiasm when they examined how people react to websites.
Video recordings have led to important discoveries in the interpretation of subtle expressions, facial movements that are only visible for a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that you can tell if someone is complaining or not by observing the subtle true expression on their face.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "Presidential Address," describes how people who cannot understand a speech due to brain damage can still assess the sincerity of the person giving the speech.
He even suggested that such an ability to interpret human behavior might be possessed by animals such as pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research indicates that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and apparent.
Mutation adds new genetic variants, and then selection removes them from the pool of represented variants.
Segregation and random recombination occur back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
When leaving the fields, it will be difficult for monkeys whose digestion is almost the same as humans to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Besides that, failing to do that thing has serious consequences: starting with depression, malnutrition, and then ultimately death.
The most accessible plant sources of protein are the protein accessible through leaves and beans, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they have been cooked.
Conversely, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not easily digested, but also supply a lot of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Having considered everything, we shouldn't be surprised anymore when we learn that our ancestors obtained protein in a way somewhat similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Sleep disturbance is a deliberate process of waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This is easily done using a silent alarm clock to awaken your consciousness without actually waking you up.
If you reset the alarm clock when you're sleepy, and the clock is kept on the other side of the room, it will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another Biorythm-based option is to drink a lot of water (clear water or tea, something that makes you pee) while sleeping, forcing a person to wake up to pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the level of stress, the more positivity in life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative thoughts.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddhism, but it is augmented by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhist path is very simple. It contains Kundalini Yoga, asceticism, and a path of love that embraces everything.
And with Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is created through yoga movements, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The central practice of Tibetan is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is generated.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the US. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural disputes caused nations to fall.
Within two years of the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It is expected to last for the next 40 years and will be fought in a very real way, by proxy forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had been destroyed. The only hope was to retreat and reorganize the defense at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, this plan faded overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods for this long has been the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The primary mission of naval forces is to ensure the nation maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting the ability of others to move their people and goods.
One important example to remember is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help England.
At the same time, German naval forces, often using U-boats, were trying to break this stalemate.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered England just as it conquered the rest of Europe.
It is estimated that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
All the ancient cultures and tribes that started the ease of finding milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Tame goats are generally kept in herds that are released in hilly areas or other grazing areas, usually herded by small children or older children, similar to shepherds that people know. This herding method is still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the cart is only made from parallel wooden planks, it will be able to make a horse to be faster and pull heavier loads than on a rough road.
Crossties were introduced early enough to hold the track in place. However, it was gradually realized that the track would be more efficient if there was iron on top of it.
This has become a common practice, but the iron is causing more damage to the wooden wheels of the cart.
Finally, wooden rails were replaced by iron rails. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known transportation was walking, with people first walking upright 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright human).
Initially, Australopithecus did not walk upright as commonly believed.
Bipedal specializations have been found in the Australopithecus fossil's fourth toe dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have already been bipedal as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly life, we can join environmental movements, and then we can even become environmental advocates to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This seems like treating the symptoms at best. But, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem, and then we must eliminate that problem.
It is very clear that the world has changed a lot due to the advancement of human science and technology, and the problems have become bigger because of the large population and the wasteful lifestyle of mankind.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten design signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent several blocks to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
On that night, 150 to 200 sheets were made, which are now famously known as "Dunlop letters".
The public reading of the document was first done by John Nixon in the American Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which was read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 famous Dunlap broadsides remain the oldest extant copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider birds to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still appear like dinosaurs.
Their feet have scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they stand upright on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only 1 of 2 values, that is 0 or 1, and it is called a binary digit - or bit, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not immediately visible. The symptoms, like vomiting, are common enough that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of poisoning is the presence of an open medicine container filled with medicine or a container of toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists to describe this type of insect.
This term originates from ancient times related to fleas, where the highly adaptable flea became a parasite of humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are equally dangerous and can adapt to living in nests and the original habitat of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it one of the most common neurological diseases affecting adults and older adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
The couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of the child, to raise the baby.
This couple may choose to foster a baby.
In adoption, the biological parents give their custody rights to another couple who will care for the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how this world works through scientific methods. In fact, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific research.
It's not alone, experimentation, and experiments are tests used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, make observations, and also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
What was accepted was Aristotle's view of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, Western people felt cut off from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many who conduct research on rhythms in physiology and behavior very often depend on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not only respond to periodic cues from the outside, have been noted for the majority of living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue its free-running cyclical period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the studies that revealed that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They tried two experiments that labeled the DNA in a phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of a phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have several different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cell is a somatic cell or a germline cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cells to die or develop cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts public interest in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying natural scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities at that location include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting the park to learn about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans in Kalimantan.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their workplaces and then pass other people whose destination is to work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation landscape, everyone can somehow connect with, and support, a transportation system based on private cars.
Current science indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from a stable state that supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in community activities and uses public transportation. Almost all people complain about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why is the transportation system generating so many complaints, failing every day? Are the transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions and relationships between them.
Unfortunately, learning the flow of traffic is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend toward reasonably consistent behavior; meanwhile, traffic flow tends to have a fair amount of consistency and can be described mathematically in a coarse way.
To better describe traffic flow, relationships have been established in three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship assists in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects are the first animals to fly. The ability to fly helps them avoid enemies and find food more easily, and to mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This provides them with places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the sun.
Some people think he's right, but many believe the opposite; that is, the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and other stars).
It seems understandable, since the Earth feels like it isn't moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, with a width of 6 miles.
20 percent of the water that flows through the world's rivers and then into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles). That river receives water from thousands of tributaries.
Although pyramid construction atop rock continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never able to surpass them in size and technical excellence in their construction.
The new kingdom of ancient Egypt marveled at the monuments left behind by their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language used by many people who work in that country, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic adherents.
People already knew about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because these elements can be found in nature and are relatively easy to mine using ancient tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, developed a theory that everything is composed of a combination of 1 or more of 4 elements. These elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more akin to the 4 states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he stated its form can be changed to be different from what I see now.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more types of metals. Don't forget there are many elements within the periodic table of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium belong to the category of metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are extremely small. To illustrate how small, a trillion atoms are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, pencils have become good friends for everyone.
What's saddening is that after new ways of writing emerged, the status and usefulness of pencils have continued to decline.
People today write messages on computer screens, no need to approach a scribe.
No one knows what will happen to the keyboard if someone new comes.
Fission bombs work based on the principle that it takes energy to bring together nuclei containing many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then separating the core and releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to split apart with little or no prompting.
The moon's surface is formed by rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner on the dark side and thicker on the light side.
Perhaps there is more lava on the side near the road because it is thinner. It is easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding what makes a person choose or what is attractive to them.
These theories suggest that people possess needs and/or desires that are sought after from adolescence to adulthood.
These theories look at what specific people want to do the things they do, and what things around them make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, 2 behaviors can emerge when a manager starts leading their colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "1 of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager experiences difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding others accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, 1 person morphed into an unrecognizable individual who felt they needed to change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
In any case, the leader is ultimately the one who must take responsibility for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often undermines the relationship between the leader and other team members.
The virtual team is organized according to the same quality standards as a conventional team, but there is a slight difference.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for the direct, physical team.
They have more autonomy than other conventional team members because they can meet in different time zones that local management cannot understand.
The existence of a real "ghost team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
An invisible team" is a management team where each member reports individually. An invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization be willing to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of practicing the learning organization concept is innovation.
Once all resources are utilized across all departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization solving problems together can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and share knowledge and learning throughout the organization.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum approach as a tool used by organizations to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making studies more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in various mental states.
The emergence of new technologies allows me to see and investigate the structure and processes of the brain that I have never seen before.
This technology provides a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes within the mind.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI forms an important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning methods, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require human intelligence.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such matters have become a separate science, specifically dedicated to providing solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they have been built into various home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are a great part of any class. Teachers often like to take their students to places but using a bus is not always an option.
Technology offers solutions and virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a great way to memorialize the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the Nation's Capital, every year the site is renovated, but the old versions are still on the site to be used as wallpaper.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with loose grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because students are critical participants, the blog writer is initially struggling to develop their writing skills to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "develops students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to inform the interests of the audience inspires students to be smarter and more engaging (Toto, 2004).
Creating a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond regular school lessons.
The benefit of a good blog is that it "can motivate students to be more analytical and critical; because they actively receive material from the internet, students can interpret or determine their position in relation to other people's meanings," not forgetting to write their opinions on other issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
All of this, and much more considered in the matter of Ontario, are all the things that outsiders think are like Canadians.
Remote areas in the north usually have few residents, and the rest is mostly just forest.
To compare large populations: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
So far, Madagascar is the largest, and it is a separate continent in wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent states, or have ties to France, and are known for luxury beaches.
Arabs also brought Islam to that island, and greatly influenced the Comoros and Mayotte regions.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, this region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: It is recommended that every female tourist state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing rings also helps a lot (but not one ring that looks very expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment and is unusual when followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be brave to reject men, and don't be afraid if you insist (cultural differences or otherwise, doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was later used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city into Daru l-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trade there.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places around Morocco for shopping.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, handicrafts, leather goods, hookahs, and a spectrum of geegaws, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo at the eastern end near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma was relatively safe, every visit except to Goma required awareness of the ongoing war in the North Kivu province.
This city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Gorilla Mountain treks in Africa.
You can use motorcycle taxis (ojek) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short distance.
Coupled with the difficulty of access, "Timbutku" is used as a metaphor for a distant and exotic region.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desertification.
That was a major stopping point during the Wonders of the African World PBS special by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is very different from other cities in that country because it is more influenced by Arab culture than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the eastern part of South Africa and stretches along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
This forest covers an area of up to 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 natural zones, each zone supporting different wildlife.
This park is one of South Africa's premier tourist attractions and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African National Parks, there are conservation and entrance fees to the park every day.
Buying a Wild Card can benefit one person. This card can be used at selected parks in South Africa or at all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory, which is considered by tourists to be a major hub.
The rows of buildings soaring into the Hong Kong skyline are likened to a sparkling bar graph rising from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To witness the best views of Hong Kong, leave the Island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coastline.
This is a place recognized by the British colonizers as their colony, so if you want to see evidence of colonial territory from the past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarban is the largest mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the part of the forest within India is called Sundarban National Park.
That forest is not only made up of mangrove swamps alone—there are some remnants there of the mighty forest that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², with about one-third of that area being water/swamp.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus terminal (via the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Because intercity buses are often full of people, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Mostly, in the regions, there are small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The safe clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to the public in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in 2017, when Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani are an important indigenous group who inhabit Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, previously known as "The Great Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the Spanish colonizers meeting the indigenous people.
The Spanish started an era of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
When Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay successfully preserved much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
Fort Hood says that the soldiers have been involved in building a hospital to fight Ebola in Africa and will return to America on emergency leave earlier this month.
Smaller competitions can also be seen here at other times in the same year.
For information about the tournament and where to buy tickets for the polo match, please check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank located on the island across from the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pound Sterling is generally accepted in any of the islands and Stanley cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are not accepted on the island archipelago, although British and US currency may be accepted; inquire with the owner to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands pounds outside the islands, so you should exchange them before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is during winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; in the summer, temperatures exceeding 30°C are common.
Winter can be quite cold: temperatures rarely drop to freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel worse than what the thermometer says.
There is no such thing as a "rainy" or "dry" season: there is only constant rain throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the zoo are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild, so don't feed them or disturb them.
According to park authorities, keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other grazing animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they do not keep the recommended distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Apart from that, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so don't bring fragrant food and keep your tent clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
That port was a notorious naval standoff location in 1889 when 7 ships from Germany, the U.S., and England refused to leave the port.
All ships have sunk, except for 1 ship. Up to 200 American and German lives became victims.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful demonstration in the city resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland has 2 harbors. The most famous ones are in 3 regions.
North Shore beach (in the southern harbor district) which is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the south to Devonport in the north.
Almost all the beaches have sand that is safe for swimming and shade because of the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in the Waitemata Harbour, alongside the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is a family beach that is sometimes bustling with nice shops lining the water's edge. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number 1', its beer is not complex, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be brought, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better if you want to bring them.
Tap water that can be drunk directly is indeed safe to drink, but bottled water is easier to find if you're worried.
For Australians, 'kopi tubruk' (thick, strong coffee) is foreign. The small black is 'espresso', cappuccino with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard. The fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
Visiting coral reefs is usually done throughout the year, and injuries due to coral are rare.
As always, follow the advice of officials, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April in North 1770. These jellyfish are sometimes also found outside of those times.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will stay away.
Freshwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give travelers a sense of comfort knowing that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, although you can still book other accommodations, such as campsites, through the travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or a combination of flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the order for you if you need time to think about the offer or purchase documents for your purpose (e.g. Visa).
All requests must go through a travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, a large portion of those attending the music festival decide to camp in the area, and most guests consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be closer to the event, you should arrive earlier to get a camping spot that's close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music on the main stage is finished, there might still be some sections setting up music until very late at night.
Some festivals have dedicated camping areas for families with children.
If you're traveling through the Northern Baltic in winter, double-check the cabin location, because traveling over ice often involves a lot of noise that will disturb you.
The Saint Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the requirements).
Casinos usually put in a lot of effort to maximize the function of time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exit doors are usually difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks and offer entertainment to keep guests happy and staying on location.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages in-house. However, as intoxication impairs decision-making, all good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitudes or over mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, so you can't drive like you would on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, there's so much snow that you could get trapped and keep falling.
Your visibility may be limited due to falling or blowing snow, or possibly due to condensation or ice on your car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and road traffic continues without disruption throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a major destination for tourists.
The term safari is generally used to refer to trips to see the magnificent wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, usually approach cars and equipment, which usually gives a good view.
Tigers, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll be able to see them more clearly if you use binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "walking on grass," "hiking safari," or simply "walking") is hiking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having previously hosted the Olympics in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have experienced a somewhat difficult situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but until the end of March, many coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled.
The majority of event tickets are expected to cost approximately between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with special tickets costing approximately ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, if not provided in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't want to iron socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if there is one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it can cause the fabric to shrink, or worse, the color to fade).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, heating water for a minute is enough, while in others it takes longer.
Filters vary in their degree of fineness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Tourists may find animal pests that are unknown to them in their home area.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or even worse, trigger allergies, spread poison, or transmit diseases.
Contagious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans with their strength, are not included in the category of pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Tourists who travel to countries with high taxes can usually save a lot of money, especially on items like alcohol and cigarettes.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through remote, rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, keep your focus: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and roads with many sharp turns.
The posted speed limit is much lower than the previous and subsequent stretches of road — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and complying with it is more important than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, the cell phone signal is stronger here than along other routes, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German cookies are very delicious, and in Bavaria, they have diverse and rich flavors, similar to its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are commonplace, with apples sliced into cakes year-round, followed by cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are usually paired with a glass of strong coffee.
If you want a small pastry that is full of flavor, try the pastry that is called depending on the area, sometimes it's called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from spices, served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be served 'dry' or 'wet' depending on the amount of gravy.
In inland areas of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the continent, coconut milk is usually used.
With its 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a general term encompassing the variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used without further qualification, this term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine presents simple dishes with key Javanese flavors such as peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
A stirrup is a support for the rider's feet that hangs on either side of the saddle.
That makes it more stable for the rider but can create safety issues because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught there.
If you fall off a horse but your foot gets caught in the stirrup, you could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear boots with heels and soft, sufficiently tight soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with diverse large granite walls and reefs.
The summit offers an amazing view from the peak. Climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes amongst its seemingly endless potential of walls.
Snow sports, descending mountains, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered ground using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the main travel activities and is enjoyed by many, sometimes known by "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around that ski resort.
Skiing has existed since ancient times — images in caves depicting people skiing have existed since 5000 BC!
Skiing downhill as a sport began at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
A bare-bones picnic using skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related, but usually does not involve alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which takes place in steep terrain that requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as a climbing route.
In good condition, you'll be able to cover more distance than walking - but you'll rarely match the speed of cross-country skiing without carrying a heavy backpack on a flat trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling in several countries means having to go through multiple visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen Zone, however, functions as one country in this respect.
As long as you live in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport checkpoints anymore.
Having a Schengen visa means you don't need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member country, ultimately saving time, money, and documents.
There is no universal definition stating what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
Its definition has geographic variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be called antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many people and other professions.
Although traditionally not all Sámi people are involved in reindeer husbandry, with many living from fishing, hunting, and other livelihoods, reindeer are used and help with work.
Nowadays, many Sámi work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and false assumptions about Roma people.
If the country you are going to visit follows one of the picnic advisories, your picnic health insurance or your picnic cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might consider consulting advice from a different government than your own, but that advice is designed for its own citizens.
For example, the American people in the Middle East are facing a different situation than the people of Europe or Arabia.
Propaganda is merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often very superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for various hazardous weather events that can cause disasters, serious social disruption, and loss of life.
Bad weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are various types, which can depend on geographical, topographical, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rain, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, whirlwinds, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Tourists are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather occurring in the area as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should have professional training.
Looking for "Security Training" on the internet may give you results for local company addresses.
The class will usually cover all the issues discussed here in more detail, often with practical experience.
A course will usually last 2-5 days and use role-playing, lots of first aid training, and sometimes gardening.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are commonly found, but writings about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must bring valid documents for round-trip travel.
The government's willingness to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or to update documents to reflect desired name and gender differences.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies greatly.
Searches at checkpoints also became more intrusive after the September 11, 2001 era.
A transgender person who hasn't had surgery wouldn't have thought they could pass registration and that their information and dignity would remain intact.
Rip current is the return flow from waves that break on the beach, often near reefs or similar structures.
Because of the underwater topology, water flow accumulates in deeper areas, and strong currents can form in the deeper water.
Most of the deaths were caused by exhaustion from swimming against the waves, which seemed impossible.
After you get out of the waves, swimming back won't be as difficult as usual.
Try to aim for one place so you don't get caught again, or, depending on your abilities and if you've already been discovered, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Deep shocks return faster than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shortened), last longer, and can be worse.
Travelers who have no difficulty adjusting to a new culture often find it even more difficult to readjust when they return to their original culture.
If you return to your home country after living abroad, you have surely adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your original culture.
When you first go abroad, people tend to be patient and understanding, knowing that tourists in a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for tourists returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one thing that children in this area really enjoy.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and quiet before the event starts.
Usually you hear the voices of tourists and merchants. The story of the sounds and lights provided is like a story from a book.
The Sphinx is established as the setting and narrator of a long story.
Some scenes were shown at the pyramid and other pyramids lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most land bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
These islands are located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Illusion Island where a flooded volcanic crater provides an excellent natural harbor.
The Ellsworth Land is an area in the south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains in the Peninsula here accompany the highlands, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains 360 km long, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountain in Antarctica, namely Vinson Massif, whose peak is at 4892 m Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where there is no cellphone signal, satellite phones can be an option.
Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for cellular phones, as you need to be outdoors with an unobstructed view of the satellite to make calls.
This service is often used for shipping, including cruise ships, and expeditions that have long-range data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
A growing popular option for those planning a gap year is volunteering and studying.
This is especially popular with school graduates. This program allows them to take a year off before entering university, without interrupting their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
There will usually be a fee to participate in these learning programs.
Finland is a great boating destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelago.
In the islands and lakes, you won't need a cruise ship.
Although the island's coast and largest lakes can accommodate large ships, smaller boats or even kayaks can provide a different experience.
Rowing a boat is a national pastime in Finland, and a boat is for seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but conversely, it is very unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is 1 in 40).
Most Baltic Cruises provide time for extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for two full days, while in the evening you can return and sleep on the ship.
If you are only arriving at the shore by cruise ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Taking a plane can be a scary thing for people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have trauma.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and personal dislike of something that many people possess.
For some people, understanding things about how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help them fight fear due to the unknown and lack of control.
Courier companies are paid a lot to deliver goods quickly. Also, time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for imminent repairs.
On certain routes, larger companies own their own vessels, but for other routes and smaller companies, there's a problem.
If they ship goods by air, on some routes, it may take a few days to unload the cargo and so on.
The only way to make it faster is to send them in a suitcase. Airline rules won't allow them to send items if there's no passenger, which is your goal.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to pay a lot of money for special privileges (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
But, that is not cheap; in my experience, you could pay 4 times more than the economy price for regular business and eleven times more for first class.
Generally, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first class seats for a direct flight from A to B.
Airlines are very aware that there's a group of flyers willing to pay more for the privilege of getting to a destination quickly and comfortably, and bearing the associated cost.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is more widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflict problems.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria) in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been rebuilt between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Treat this site with the utmost dignity, reverence, and respect as it deserves. Do not trivialize the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by marking or scrawling graffiti on the structure's interior.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, as many people understand it, and almost everyone uses Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only displayed in Catalan simply because the law stipulates that it is the primary official language.
However, Spanish is already widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Announcements in the Metro are usually announced in Catalan, but if there are unplanned disruptions, they are announced by an automated system in several languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
People from Paris are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to be on your best behavior with others, to act like a "bien élevé" person (raised with good manners). This will make traveling much easier.
The spontaneity of Parisians will disappear very quickly if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, as well as a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
This is known for its diverse collection of plant species, due to the range of microclimates, varied soils, and different altitudes.
That area is also home to a very diverse range of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting the monastery, women must wear a skirt that covers the knees and must also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do provide clothing for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, the monks or nuns at the door will smile at you.
In the same row, men must wear long pants that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the items displayed in the front, but those clothes haven't been washed and many people have already tried them on. Number 1 fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of the Mediterranean region, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and everything is prepared with olive oil.

All nouns and the word "Sie" (a formal pronoun for "you") for you are always capitalized, even when they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and nouns.
This can make reading easier, although writing is indeed a bit difficult because it requires searching for verbs and adjectives to use in a form that can be proven correct.
Speaking Italian is relatively easy because most words are pronounced based on how they are written.
The main letters being considered are c and g, because their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
Also, make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently; "caro" means deer, while "carro" means carriage.

However, someone who knows a little Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is close and therefore doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated, but they remain museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't the kind of problem it is now during their heyday, they were usually located in cities or on campuses, making them more easily accessible than those built in the modern era.
The modern research telescope is a large facility in a rural area with good weather.
Seeing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the plum blossom became the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festival was held by the emperor for himself and members of the aristocracy surrounding the Imperial Court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the urge to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, taking "specimens" will also get you kicked out without warning.
Generally, Singapore is a very safe and easy place to navigate, and you can buy anything you need after you arrive.
But because it is located in a "high tropical" area just a few degrees north of the equator, you must strongly feel the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more common).
There are also some buses that go to northern Hebron, the traditional burial place for religious figures such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you're thinking of goes all the way to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a boat to bustling cities on the Danube or rafting along the Erie Canal.
They also manage routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays for Christians and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with holidays have been adopted by people who do not practice religion in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake until morning on Easter night in some places that are open to watch the sunrise.
Of course there is a Christian theological explanation for this tradition, but perhaps it is a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
Many traditional churches often celebrate Easter Vigil on Saturday at the end of Easter week, and congregations often hold a midnight service to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that come to these islands arrive either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not complete the journey, which is why Giant Tortoises became the primary herbivores in the Galapagos.
After people arrived in the Galapagos, many mammal animals became known, for example goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you come to the Arctic or Antarctic region during winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is offering a great opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, because the sky will be darkest or at least relatively dark from around that time.
Because the area is sparsely populated, and because light pollution isn't a problem, you'll also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more focused on position and formality compared to what is commonly practiced by Westerners.
Wearing suits has become standard attire for work, and employees address each other by family name or title.
