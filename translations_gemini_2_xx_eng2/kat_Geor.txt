Besides confirming the existing theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, this also provides details such as color and information about three-dimensional arrangement, which we cannot obtain from fossils.
Scientists believe that this creature had chestnut-colored feathers on top, and pale or carotenoid coloration on the underside and sides.
The discovery also allows us to better study the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis, the so-called spine, even though they have other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers hypothesize that the rachis may have developed later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were used not for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Although researchers suspect this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample exhibits adult, not hatchling, plumage.
Despite the fact that this is a younger dinosaur's tail, researchers believe the feathers are more adult-like than chick-like.

Although the program was written for simulating observations of the Sagittarius galaxy, the work done was primarily theoretical.
The effect the group was looking for should have been caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
The Milky Way is influencing the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy in exactly the same way that the Moon's gravity influences the Earth, causing tides.
Scientists have come to the final conclusion that dark matter, like ordinary matter, affects other dark matter.
According to the given theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is concentrated in the form of a halo around the galaxy and consists of numerous small particles.

Traditionally, voting in France has been a low-tech affair: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot, indicating their chosen candidate, into an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
French electoral law reflects the relevant procedures quite strictly.
From 1988 it was decided that the ballot box should be transparent so that voters and observers would have the opportunity to ensure for themselves that there were no envelopes in the box at the beginning of the vote and that no extra envelopes were added to it, except for those correctly counted and belonging to eligible voters.
Candidates are allowed to send their own representatives to observe all parts of the process. In the evening, under strict monitoring and adhering to specific procedures, volunteers count the votes.

Carpanedo competed in the championship in two different races, in addition to Wednesday's competition.
He competed in slalom for the first time at a competition, where he received a "Did Not Finish" (DNF) in the first run. At the same competition, 36 out of 116 participants received the same result.
She finished tenth in the sitting women's group in the next giant slalom competition with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes later than Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes later than Hungarian Gyöngyi Dans, who finished ninth.
Four skiers in the women's division failed to finish the competition, and out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom, 45 did not place at all in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered a stolen mobile phone and laptop.
"We have arrested five people accused of raping a Swiss woman and stealing her mobile phone and laptop," said Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya.
Baba Kanjari, Bhuta Kanjari, Rampro Kanjari, Gaza Kanjari, and Vishnu Kanjari have been named as accused.
According to Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused in the crime appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people in the house at the time of the car crash, no one was injured.
The driver still sustained serious injuries to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed until the emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After this, he started working at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoia, accused of murdering his son, then appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is in pre-trial detention awaiting indictment and trial, however, after the disclosure of his identity, any testimony from witnesses may be recognized as tainted evidence.
In Great Britain, this is a common practice, however, Scottish law operates differently, and courts perceive the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is entirely in charge of court prosecution, told journalists that it would no longer comment, at least until charges are brought.
According to leaked information, the document concerns the border dispute that Palestine wanted within the borders it possessed before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Jerusalem's future state and the Jordan Valley, which is a sacred place for both nations, are subsequent topics for reporting.
Following the signing of the agreement, Israel demands the deployment of military forces in the valley for a period of ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a deployment of only five years.
Shooters participating in the additional pest control combat test were to be supervised by rangers because the test was being controlled and its effectiveness needed to be assessed.
Qualified volunteers have been recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association Hunting Program in partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW).
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the initial cull received full safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martel's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the large-scale protests that began in October against the regime was the establishment of a commission.
Some violent protests were caused by the fact that elections had not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating have been reported, of which 6 resulted in fires and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that they are aware of 27 incidents related to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Entrepreneurship announced that Apple had reported to it 34 more overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of submitting the report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (Friday, 21:19 GMT).
According to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Office, there were no reported injuries to people in the country.
Furthermore, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, no signs of a tsunami have been observed.
In the past, a Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages were released, and according to confirmed information, at least six people are dead at this time.
Filipino photographers, as well as six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released soon after.
Because the elderly woman needed the restroom, the photographers took her place. Mendoza was killed with a firearm.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and began a medical career.
She upgraded her qualifications to the position of midwife and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During the time Liggins was working at the hospital, he began studying premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that the maturation of a baby's fetal lungs was accelerated by the administration of the hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators discovered two "black boxes" containing flight data on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by her wrestler friends.
"Luna, the Queen of Extreme, was my first manager. Luna passed away on a double moon night, on a day as unique as she was. She was a strong woman," Tommy Dreamer said.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said: "Luna was just as crazy as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of opponents of Australia becoming a republic, which had existed since 2008, increased by 8 percent.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic after the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed support the view that Queen Elizabeth II may be Australia's last monarch.
In extreme cases, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but doubts were raised about his good physical condition due to complaints.
He couldn't take his own pain medication because their use is prohibited at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, made a discovery about the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Using various techniques and software, several people confirmed a discovery made in early February, after which the announcement about the discovery was released on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can create proteins and provide life with the means to exist.
Scientists hope to figure out how planets formed, and especially how Earth formed, after it was struck by comets a very long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and signed the same-sex marriage bill into law last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
They are expecting him to be nominated as a presidential candidate in 2016.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to travel on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
Unlike older land-based radar technology, it uses satellite-based technology, which enables air traffic controllers to more accurately determine aircraft movement and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transportation is not provided, trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking is not available on the premises.
Fears of a lack of transportation led to the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without supporters.
According to a study published in the journal "Science" on Thursday, a new species of bird has been discovered in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
According to researchers from Uppsala University in Sweden and Princeton University in the United States, a new species evolved in just two generations, despite the process being thought to take much longer, as it involved the hybridization of the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can even be worked into very small shapes.
It can be made into thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be thinned considerably and attached to another metal. It can be thinned to the point that it was sometimes used to decorate the so-called "illuminated manuscripts" in hand-painted pictures in books.
This is called the pH (acidity) of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether a chemical substance is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons stripped of electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one electron and one proton).
Mix the two dry powders together, squeeze them in your hand, and shape them into a ball using clean, wet hands.
The lotion reacts with the outer layers of your hands, creating a pleasant sensation and forming a kind of film.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
In Greece, remnants of sewage systems have been discovered in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, within residential areas.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets sometimes formed part of public baths, which men and women used together.
You are using a satellite when you call someone thousands of miles away.
The satellite receives a signal in space and almost immediately reflects it back.
The artificial satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts certain parts of our light and view.
He is launching a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has incredibly changed the world. The best thing that the wheel brought to humanity is the invention of much simpler and faster means of transportation.
He brought us many means of transportation, such as trains, cars, and others.
Below them are mid-sized felines that prey on mid-sized victims, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In conclusion, there are many small members of the cat family (including domestic cats) that consume much larger quantities of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of a niche, meaning that each cat has its own specific job, preventing competition between them, is the secret to their success.
Lions are the most communicative cats. They live in families, so-called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Lionesses are closely connected and live in large families consisting of mothers and daughters.
A pride of lions is very similar in behavior to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that also remarkably resemble lions in their manner of behavior (but not other big cats) and are also extremely deadly to their prey.
A tiger, a well-rounded athlete, is capable of climbing (though not very deftly), swimming, long-distance jumping, and dragging with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is more like a sentence composed of screamed words than a lion's fully sonorous roar.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible. Almost every animal that an ocelot hunts is much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals they can eat (prey) on the ground by scent.
With their night vision, they see perfectly in the dark and move silently. Ocelots blend into their surroundings while hunting prey, then attack it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population (for example, if a small population crosses a mountain peak or crosses a river, or settles on a new island and cannot easily return), in most cases it finds itself in a different environment than it has been in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need to develop new traits or adapt in order to become stronger competitors than before.
The original population hasn't changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
As new populations adapt to a new environment over time, they become less and less like the original population.
Ultimately, these two populations will look so different after a thousand or even a million years that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation and only implies the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants release oxygen, which humans breathe, while they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants obtain food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes with plants, and we even make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Animals could not exist without plants.
The mosasaur was a predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
More than 70 sharp teeth were lined up in its long jaws. It had an additional set of teeth on the upper part of its mouth, which meant that anyone who encountered it would have nowhere to escape.
It's possible it had a forked tongue, although we don't know for sure. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
It attacked everything that went into the water; even a dinosaur as enormous as a Tyrannosaurus Rex could not compare to it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual dishes at feasts, such as boar, peacock, snails, and a species of rodent called a dormouse.
The next distinction was that the poor and women ate their food sitting on stools, while wealthy men preferred to feast together reclining on their sides while consuming food.
Ancient Roman dishes could not have contained food products that were introduced to Europe in later centuries from America or Asian countries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, nor had any ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, which were considered to be the god's houses.
People sacrificed to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary reserved only for priests.
Sometimes, ziggurats, distinctive pyramid-shaped towers, were built as integral parts of temples.
The tower's peak represented God's special throne.
The house wasn't that important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
A Jewish family spent most of their life outdoors.
The women were cooking food in the yard. The shops were open stalls standing directly on the street. They used stone to build the houses.
In the land of Canaan, wood was very expensive because large forests did not exist.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, as told in the Norse sagas, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its present name.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Despite the "Scandinavian-ness" of each state, the inhabitants, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland still differed greatly.
Watching the movie "National Treasure" might lead you to believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Despite that, this is not the case. Though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back, the Declaration of Independence had the words written: "Original Declaration of Independence, Date: July 4, 1776". The text is upside down, located at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows who actually wrote it, it is known that a large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was prepared for storage in its early stages of creation.
So, likely, the record was simply added as a label.
The landing of the troops and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained occupied.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. This was the French people who, in 1940, made peace with the Germans and, instead of fighting the invaders, worked with them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1944, the invasion operation was called "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks and advanced towards Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a very large group of people who live and work together based on cooperation; it is the same as a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means "civil." It is related to the Latin words "civis," which means "citizen," and "civitas," which means "city" or "city-state," thus defining to some extent the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. The culture of civilization implies the transmission of knowledge through generations, the preservation of the cultural heritage, and its just distribution.
Many small cultures disappear without leaving a corresponding historical trace and without being recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government - Congress was its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state bodies, which in most cases did not cooperate with others in enforcing its acts.
It also lacked sufficient authority over tax laws and tariffs between the states.
Amending the articles of the Constitution required the unanimous consent of all states, and the states had such a frivolous attitude towards the central government that their representatives often did not attend the discussions.
The Italian national football team, like the German national football team, is ranked second among the most successful national teams in the world. They were named the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing are among the popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Given that the Japanese have nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), Japan ranks 7th in the world for the most islands!
Due to its cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century when European sailors passed by the island and named it Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in aboriginal grain production and employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885, after the Qing Dynasty's (1644-1912) armed forces gained control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which China ceded Taiwan to Japan, which Japan governed until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the complex's shores have been reconstructed to better present their original appearance to tourists.
30% of Machu Picchu was restored in 1976, and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most widespread format for still images is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but most importantly, its screen aspect ratio is taken from the format of a digital camera's image sensor.
The 35mm format, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm, can be somewhat confusing.
This format's aspect ratio (which is divisible by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is, as noted, 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format group) are equal to or close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often not used and is neglected, is a simple guideline for creating dynamics, maintaining order in the composition of images.
It appears that the most effective place to intersect the main subject's lines is where it divides the image into thirds, vertically and horizontally (see example).
The wealthy and powerful Catholic Church became a subject of careful scrutiny during this period of European history.
Despite differences in language and customs, the Christian religion has united European states for over a thousand years.
His boundless power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
The idea that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that funds are collected in churches precisely for this purpose, is a core Christian principle.
For a millennium, Rome was the seat of central church authority, and such concentration of power and money raised questions about the extent to which this principle was being satisfied.
Britain placed Germany under naval blockade in the shortest time after the start of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective. It halted the supply of vital military and civilian supplies. However, this blockade also violated generally accepted principles of international law, enshrined in several international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean. This posed a threat to neutral ships as well.
Given that this tactic had limited repercussions, Germany anticipated a similar response to submarine warfare, which was not prohibited for them.
In the 1920s, the prevailing sentiment among most citizens and nations leaned towards pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid a similar situation from happening again in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 and began working in New York City at Edison's company.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in his previous job).
Ancient China had a distinctive way of reflecting different periods; every period of China was part of a specific dynasty, and so was every family in power.
Also, between the rule of each dynasty was an unstable era of fragmented provinces. The most famous period among them was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At this time, fierce fighting was taking place among many nobles vying for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras. Thousands of lives were sacrificed to seize the supreme throne of the Grand Palace of Xian.
There are many social and political influences, such as the transition from absolutism to republicanism, the adoption of the metric system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, all male candidates were able to hold office, which facilitated the promotion of the most ambitious and successful people.
Given that military ranks, which until now were based on class, are now dependent on merit, this also applies to the military.
The French Revolution also inspired many repressed working-class people in various countries to launch their own coups.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited the cave "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
He rests on the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, where a cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, even if someone knew of its existence, finding it wouldn't be all that easy. Once inside the cave, there is complete isolation.
You will see nothing above but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. Only a very small part of the world can be seen or heard from the depths of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only wonder of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to this day.
The great pyramid, built by Egyptians in the 3rd century BC to honor the deceased pharaoh, is among the largest pyramids in the world.
The Giza Plateau, located in the Egyptian Necropolis, or "Giza Necropolis," consists of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx statue.
The Great Pyramid was built to glorify Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built for Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper ascending mark looks like a V, while the lower descending mark resembles a stapler or a rectangle with the bottom side missing.
Upward means that you should start from the tip of the arrow and push it, while downward means that you should start from the shaft of the arrow (where you hold the arrow with your hand) and pull it towards you.
Tilting the bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while tilting the bow downwards produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You are free to make your own notes in pencil, but remember that the printed symbols have a musical purpose, so we must treat them with care.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11, and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and Madame Elisabeth, the King's sister, surrounded by a mob of market women, were forcibly returned from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back by carriage towards Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats at the King and Queen.
A mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
A member of the attacking mob shook the head of the royal guard captain, who had been killed in Versailles, in front of the terrified queen at one point.
It was the Filipinos who financed the costs of the United States' imperialist war aimed at conquering the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to cover the principal and interest expenses on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking affiliates.
It is undeniable that the main achievement of US imperialism is the revenue gained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the situation that led to the creation of the Order.
The period when these events took place, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD), is known as the High Middle Ages.
The Early Middle Ages preceded the Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of practical ideas, starting with a striving towards technology or technological necessity and ending with the rigid notion that human destiny is determined by the logic underlying scientific laws and their implementation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: one is that technological development proceeds on its own path, largely beyond cultural or political influence, and the other is that technology, in turn, "influences" societies in an immanent and not socially determined way.
For example, someone might say that road development is unconditionally determined by the automobile.
However, the country's road network is not economically profitable for a small number of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
One of the reasons for the increase in traffic accidents, which in turn can be the basis for new technologies to restore damaged bodies, is the massive increase in the number of car owners.
An important component of cultural determinism was Romanticism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
From a romantic perspective, geography sculpted individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to geography were formed, which were more in harmony with the society's location than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople, much like Paris which is known as the modern world's fashion capital, was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as a center of luxury around 400 AD and existed until around 1100 AD.
In the twelfth century, after the return of the Crusaders, when they brought back gifts such as silk and spices, its status declined, as these gifts were worth more than the products offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was precisely during this period that the status of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
In the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries, the Gothic style reached its peak.
For the first time, Byzantine culture had a great influence on clothing in the East.
However, Western-style species may lag behind by 25-30 years due to slow communication channels.
Western Europe began refining individual style at the end of the Middle Ages. As a result of the Crusades, one of the greatest events of this time was the beginning of the use of buttons by people to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture implies that food is produced only in the amount sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds of plants from the local ecoregion and employs crop rotation or other relatively simple technologies to grow crops.
Historically, the majority of farmers engaged in agriculture for subsistence purposes, and in many developing countries this is still the case today.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals ostracized by social standards and allow them to form a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as an independent culture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical. It can also be a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often announce their membership through a distinctive and symbolic style, encompassing dress, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is a number of unfortunate cases involving children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate violence, were not socialized by adults during their developmental period.
Such children are called feral or insane. Some feral children were kept locked away from people (often by their own parents); in some cases, the reason for the abandonment of the child by the parents was the unacceptability of his or her serious mental or physical impairment.
Feral children may have suffered cruel treatment or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
It is believed that some were raised by animals; it is also said that some lived independently in the wild.
Having been raised entirely by wild animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (with limited physical abilities) that are nearly identical to those of their animal foster parent, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Scaffolded instruction takes project-based learning a step further by simplifying and making the learning process more engaging.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support tool for individuals acquiring new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A matrix can be virtual as well as real; in other words, a teacher is a form of matrix, but so is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
The purpose of virtual scaffolding embedded in software is to ask questions, give instructions, and explain procedures that a student might find difficult to handle alone.
The placement of children in shelters happens for many different reasons, starting with violence and ending with neglect and extortion.
A child should not grow up in an environment where there is little care, nurturing, and education, although this often happens.
We believe that a safe haven for these children would be the adoption system.
Our shelters' commitment is to provide loving caregivers, stable education, safe homes, and reliable healthcare.
Shelters should address all the needs of children that were lacking in their old homes from which they were taken.
The internet contains elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinguishing characteristics of the internet necessitate the use of additional parameters and a graphical approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" represent significant motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
When they were studying audience reactions to websites, "personal involvement" and "continuous interaction" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998).
The use of video recordings allowed us to make significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
More precisely, they claim that whether a person is lying can be determined by the correct interpretation of micro-expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks showed how people who, despite having lost the ability to understand speech due to brain damage, can accurately perceive sincerity.
He speculated that animals, such as dogs, might also share this ability to interpret human behavior.
Twentieth-century research revealed two forms of hereditary variation: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle two forms of hereditary variation back and forth in each generation.
In the savanna, primates with a human-like digestive system struggle to meet their amino acid needs with the existing plant resources.
Failure to comply with the above, in addition to everything else, may have severe consequences, including severe depression, eating disorders, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant-based protein sources are those found in leaves and legumes, but if they are not prepared, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
Despite this, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only not easily digestible, but it also contains a large amount of protein, which includes vitally important amino acids.
Given everything, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" roughly like chimpanzees in the savanna.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentionally interrupting sleep during a normal sleep period, followed by falling back asleep relatively quickly (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a gentle alarm clock to wake you up gradually instead of fully jolting you awake.
If you turn off the alarm clock while still sleepy, you can put it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based variations include drinking a lot of fluids before bed (especially well-known diuretics like water or tea), which forces a person to wake up to urinate.
The degree to which a person is internally peaceful is inversely correlated with the tension of the mind and body.
As tension decreases, the manifestation of life's positive force increases. Every person has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only factor hindering this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, and spread through the compassion of Mahayana and numerous methods of Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is, in principle, quite simple. It includes meditation, Kundalini Yoga, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga practice, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra, and visualization.
Divine Yoga is a Tibetan meditation center. Clearing energy channels, activating chakras, and creating enlightened awareness are achieved through visualizing various deities.
During World War II, the common enemy was Germany, which is why the USSR and the USA decided to cooperate. However, after the war ended, disagreements about systems, processes, and culture caused division between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the Cold War began, and former allies became enemies.
He would spend the next 40 years on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans lost their force overnight when, after the occupation of Poland's eastern regions, more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered, opening the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, which constituted a violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way, especially when transporting large quantities of passengers and goods across the ocean.
Naval activity has traditionally meant a country maintaining the ability to move its people and goods, while hindering the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II is the most prominent recent example of this. The Americans spared no effort in trying to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
During which time the German Navy, mainly through submarines, tried to stop these shipments.
In the event of an Allied collapse, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as well, just as it did with the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats appears to have first occurred approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began domesticating animals to obtain milk, wool, meat, and leather more easily.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, and which were often controlled by children or adolescent goat herders, much like typical shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Toll roads in England were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the railway trolley consisted only of parallel wooden planks, horses were harnessed to them in order to achieve greater speed and transport more cargo than on the other slightly rough roads of the day.
Railway sleepers were invented much earlier to hold the rails firmly in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more effective if they had metal clips pressing down on them.
This became a common practice, but iron caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out more quickly.
Gradually, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first all-metal structure appeared.
The first known method of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright-walking human).
Australopithecines, who were their ancestors, were usually unable to walk upright properly.
Bipedal adaptation has been found in australopithecine fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, but Sahelanthropus likely moved on two legs earlier, seven million years ago.
We can join a more harmonious environmental movement. Also, we may even become activists in the future to avoid damage in some way.
In most cases, this resembles symptomatic treatment. However, if our goal is not just to find a temporary solution, then we must identify the source of the problems and eliminate it.
It is clear that the world has undergone significant change as a result of humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have been further exacerbated by overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyles.
Following its approval by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, today they are known as the "Dunlap Broadside".
On July 8th, John Nixon held the first public reading of the document in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The oldest surviving copy of the document is 25 Dunlop boards. The original manuscript has not been preserved.
Some paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and continues to live today. We call them birds.
Because they had feathers and could fly, many people don't consider them dinosaurs.
Birds have many characteristics that remind you of dinosaurs.
They have scaly and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Today, all computers in use rely on the virtual processing of information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning might not manifest quickly. Nausea-like sensations are so common that it's impossible to make a quick diagnosis.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of open medicine containers or toxic chemicals in the house.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists mistakenly use the term "insect" for this group of insects.
This term comes from the well-known bed bugs, which are insects adapted to parasitizing humans, dating back to ancient times.
Like assassin bugs, bed bugs are born helpless and adapted to their host's nest or dwelling.
In the US, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists only of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or in the child's best interest.
These couples have the opportunity to plan the adoption of a child.
Upon adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated so that another couple can exercise guardianship over the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the universe works through the scientific method. In fact, most scientific research is guided by this method.
This is not only an experiment, but also a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, while questioning and observation also contribute to scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers are oriented towards classical texts, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on various issues, including psychology, were accepted.
The West drifted away from the roots of Greek philosophy and science as the level of knowledge of the Greek language declined.
Many rhythms observed in behavior and physiology are critically dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production with the help of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not simply reflections of external periodic cues are observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-regulating oscillator that follows a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
That DNA is genetic material was one of the main assumptions of the Hershey–Chase experiment.
To insert their own DNA into a bacterium, Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments, either introducing DNA into bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus or labeling the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
A mutation can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children; other types of mutations may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts the attention of people who are interested in visiting natural sites for their landscapes, including viewing plants and wildlife.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting reserves, and learning about the ecosystem are examples of activities to do here.
An example of this is visiting Borneo, taking photos, and studying orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns to drive to their workplaces, while other people heading in the opposite direction pass them by, people whose workplaces are precisely the places they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation swirl, everyone is connected in one way or another, and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Massive carbon farming has altered the stable state of the biosphere that, as science now indicates, has fostered human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone in society participates in and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone expresses complaints about transportation systems.
You would rarely hear complaints of this type, regarding water quality and bridge collapses, in developed countries.
Why do transport systems receive so many complaints, why do they have so many failures daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental at play?
The study of the movement of specific drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is called traffic flow.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to study traffic flow because predicting driver behavior with 100% accuracy is impossible.
Fortunately, drivers operate within a reasonable range of consistency; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in a rough manner.
Relationships were established between three main characteristics to better plan transportation movement: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These interrelationships facilitate the planning, design, and operation of highway improvements.
The first animals to develop flight were insects. The ability to fly helped them to more easily evade predators, obtain food, and mate more effectively.
The advantage of most insects lies in their ability to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small-sized places to hide from predators.
Currently, among insects, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings back.
A man named Aristarchus stated thousands of years ago that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, although many believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That's reasonable, because it doesn't feel at all like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It is 8 times more abundant in water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its width sometimes reaching six miles.
The Amazon accounts for 20 percent of the total water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical perfection of construction, although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then a thousand years old.
Approximately 800 people live in the Vatican. It is the smallest independent country in the world, with the smallest population.
In official communications and legislation, the Vatican uses the Italian language.
Italian is also an everyday language used by those employed in government structures, while Latin is used during religious ceremonies.
Every citizen in Vatican City is Catholic.
Since the ancient period, man has known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because with primitive tools it was easy to obtain and extract all of these in their natural form from nature.
According to the philosopher Aristotle's theory, everything is composed of a mixture of one to four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
Despite resembling the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, he also speculated that they were being transformed into new substances in order to create what we perceive.
An alloy is a mixture composed primarily of two or more metals. Don't forget that Mendeleev's periodic table combines many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small; trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil has proven to be a reliable friend to many people since its appearance in the world.
Unfortunately, since new writing methods emerged, the pencil has lost its status and necessity.
Since people now type messages on computer screens, they don't even have to deal with sharpeners anymore.
A person might wonder what will become of the keyboard after something new appears.
The working principle of an atomic bomb is expressed through the energy released by assembling a nucleus with numerous protons and neutrons.
It reminds you of pushing a very heavy cart uphill. The nucleus keeps breaking down and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they can decay with a little contact or even without contact.
The Moon's outer shell is called the crust. The Moon's surface is covered in rocks and dust.
On the near side, the crust is approximately 70 km thick, while on the far side it is 100 km thick.
It is thinner near the sea, and thicker in the mountainous area.
Given that the crust is thinner on this side, there may be more lunar maria on the near side. Lava could erupt more easily.
Content theories study what motivates people and what they find attractive.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that become more realized as they enter adulthood.
These theories explore what it is in some people that compels them to want what they want, and which factors in their environment compel them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two of the most common content theories.
When managers start leading former peers, generally, two types of behavior can occur. One such behavior involves remaining "one of the boys (girls)."
Making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibility, and being accountable to people are not characteristic of this type of manager.
A person transforms into an unrecognizable figure at the other end of the spectrum, feeling that they must change everything and make it their own task, what the team was implementing.
Despite everything, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
Mostly, such actions cause division between leaders and the rest of the team.
Managing virtual teams happens according to advanced standards, as in the case of regular teams, although there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often represent direct, in-person team contacts.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their team may meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is the existence of a veritable "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The invisible team" is the ruling team to which every member is accountable. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why does the organization want to go through the laborious process of creating a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals of establishing organizational learning concepts in practice.
Creativity and innovation emerge when all available resources are effectively utilized within an organization's functional departments.
As a result, the collaborative work process of an organization to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, the leadership must establish a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angell (2006) explains a method for organizations to achieve higher levels of efficiency — the continuum approach.
Neurobiological data represents physical evidence for the theoretical approach to consciousness research. Consequently, it narrows the area of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviors helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that certain brain injuries, traumas, pathological changes, and tumors can affect human behavior and also lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we haven't seen before.
He provides us with a wealth of information and materials to create a simulation model, which helps us understand the processes taking place in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is closely associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science related to the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves the creation of mechanisms for automating tasks that require intellectual skills.
Control, planning and scheduling, responding to user diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition are examples of this.
This has become a separate discipline, focused on ways to solve real-life problems.
Today, artificial intelligence systems are frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields, and are also integrated into home computers and some video game software.
Excursions are an important part of any educational process. Often, a teacher wants to take their students to a place where it's impossible to go by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. While in the classroom, students have the opportunity to explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful works of art.
A virtual tour is an excellent way for future students to reflect on their travels and share their own experiences.
For example, in North Carolina, students at Bennett School create a website each year about their trip to the state capital, the website is updated annually, but older versions are kept online like an online memory book.
Blogs can also help students' writing. While students may start their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience changes everything.
Inasmuch as students represent the most critical audience, the blog author tries to refine their writing style to minimize criticism.
Producing a blog also "forces students to master the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interests encourages students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires students to work collaboratively and encourages them to continue learning beyond the traditional school day.
"The proper use of blogs "may motivate students to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to online materials, students can define their positions and their own perspectives on specific issues in the context of other students' work (Oravec, 2002)."
In Ottawa, Canada's charming, bilingual capital, you can visit art galleries and diverse museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while to the north lies Muskoka and the unspoiled beauty of nature beyond.
All of this, and more, underscores the perception of Ontario by foreigners as quintessentially Canadian.
The territories located to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited, desolate places.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are citizens of Canada.
In the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa, lie the islands of East Africa.
Among them, Madagascar is the largest, and due to the diversity of its wildlife, it could be said that it represents a continent in itself.
Most of the small islands known for their luxurious seaside resorts are either independent or states associated with France.
Arabs brought Islam to these lands as well. It became very widespread on the Comoro Islands and Mayotte.
When the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope, European influence and colonization began in the 15th century.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler, regardless of her actual marital status, say that she is married.
It's best to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can be perceived by them as gender harassment, and it is common for someone to pursue a woman, grab her arm, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and don't be afraid to stand firm in your position (cultural difference cannot be used as justification!).
In the 10th century BC, the modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen and used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese razed it to the ground and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, before abandoning it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Baida, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants, founders of the Casablanca trade routes.
Casablanca is the least attractive place in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods and where you can buy tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of jewelry, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a city located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed the city of Goma. Most of the city's streets, especially the city center, are buried in lava.
Any travel outside of Goma, although travel within Goma is reasonably safe, should be researched in advance to investigate ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also used as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and is one of the cheapest points for gorilla trekking.
To get around in Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). Usually (locally), the price for a short distance ride is about 500 Congolese francs.
Due to its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Despite its tourist appeal, reputation, and airport, Timbuktu is still a poor city.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in 1990, as it was endangered due to desert sand.
During the filming of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" within the framework of public broadcasting, it was one of the main stopping points.
The city differs sharply from the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arabic feel than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Zimbabwe to the north, Mozambique to the east, and follows the Crocodile River border to the south.
The park's area is 19,500 km² and it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with its own distinct wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the best example of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, daily conservation and entry fees apply here.
Purchasing a Wild Card, which grants you access to part of a South African park or a full South African National Parks pass, may also be worthwhile.
The Hong Kong district is named after Hong Kong Island. It is a place of major interest for many tourists.
The arrangement of buildings that forms Hong Kong's skyline resembles a magnificent bar graph, clearly visible on the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Along the northern coast, on reclaimed land, the largest part of Hong Kong Island's urban development is overcrowded.
This is the place that British colonists occupied and turned into their own territory, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans, the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretches for about 80 km from the coastal border of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The forest area within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps; they also encompass surviving portions of the once mighty jungles that stretched across the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans is 3,850 km² in area, of which approximately one-third is covered by water/swamp.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that the area is home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer today.
From the intercity bus station (across the river), buses, especially those departing between 06:30 and 07:30, head east towards Jakar/Bumthang and run throughout the day.
Since intercity buses are often overcrowded, I advise you to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Comfortable and durable small Japanese buses serve most parts of the neighborhoods.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get around in nearby areas, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects Oyapock in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it follows two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be put into operation in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed.
The most important group of native inhabitants was the Guarani, who now live in eastern Paraguay and are semi-nomadic hunters who also practice family farming.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who subsisted on hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay emerged in the 16th century through the merging of Spanish conquistadors and groups of local aborigines, and was formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies."
The Spanish began colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
After the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay was able to acquire and maintain many indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known worldwide for having one of the best teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December on the polo fields of Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, it is also possible to watch less important tournaments and matches here.
For tournament news and information, including where to purchase polo match tickets, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands and is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at a 1:1 exchange rate.
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on Stanley Island, opposite the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted anywhere on the islands. Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards probably won't work on remote islands, although they will accept British and United States currency; speak to the owners in advance and determine which method of payment is acceptable.
Try to exchange currency before leaving the islands, as exchanging the official Falkland currency outside the islands is almost impossible.
Given that Montevideo is located south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in Montevideo, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; temperatures of +30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: although temperatures rarely drop to freezing, the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There are no defined "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals living in the park are used to seeing people, a wild animal is still wild, and it is not necessary to feed or disturb it.
Park management advises us to keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals.
Almost all large animals, including bison, elk, moose, and bears, are capable of attacking, no matter how docile they may appear.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year. This is because they do not maintain a suitable distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, therefore a certain space should be kept from them.
Also, remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so avoid carrying or preparing smelly food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a military-naval confrontation in 1889 that nearly led to a crisis, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
Apart from the British cruiser, all the ships sank. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans died.
A peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of Chief Tupuā Tamasese Lealofi III, during the Mau movement's struggle for independence.
Due to the amalgamation of many harbors in Auckland, there are a lot of beaches, with three zones being the most popular.
The Pacific Ocean is home to the North Shore (North Harbour region), which stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Here almost everywhere is a sandy beach where you can swim safely and there is shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's waterfront is located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburb between Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
Here are family-friendly beaches that get crowded periodically, with a large selection of shops lined up along the coast. Swimming is absolutely safe.
"Number One" is a noteworthy local beer, which isn't complex but has a pleasant and refreshing aroma. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are easier to ship.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're cautious, you can easily find bottled water.
The concept of "flat white" coffee is unfamiliar to Australians. They call a small black coffee "espresso," a cappuccino has a high layer of cream on top (not foam), and they will offer you tea without milk.
Belgian standard hot chocolate is fully compliant. As for the fruit juices, despite being expensive, they stand out with an excellent aroma.
Throughout the year, many travelers visit the reef, although damage from this is rare.
Get advice from the authorities, observe all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings, regardless of everything.
From October to April of 1770, box jellyfish appeared near the coast and in river reserves. Their discovery also occurred sporadically beyond this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of and avoid people.
The primary habitat of saltwater crocodiles is the rivers north of Rockhampton, while in the ocean they lead a passive life.
Advance booking gives travelers peace of mind, as they will have accommodation upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agency agents often make deals with specific hotels, however, through a travel agency you also have the possibility to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites.
Tourist agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast and transportation from/to the airport, or combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa), they will hold the reservation for you.
Firstly, any communication regarding changes or requests should be done through the travel agency and not directly with the hotel.
Especially during music festivals, the absolute majority of listeners camp on-site at some festivals, which is an essential part of the experience for most.
If you want to be close to the activity you're planning to attend, you should arrive early in order to manage to get a spot close to the music in the camping area.
Remember that if the music stops playing on the main stage, there may be sections at the festival where music is played until late.
Some festivals have designated camping areas specifically for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, and given that snowmobiles cause a terrible noise, especially for those most affected, check the location of the huts.
St. Petersburg cruises include a city tour. Visa requirements (check the conditions) do not apply to cruise passengers.
Casinos typically employ every means to increase the time and money spent by their guests. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and exits are also difficult to find.
To ensure guests are in good spirits and don't leave the premises, they typically provide special food, drinks, and entertainment.
In some places, they offer alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and a good player knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive in elevated areas or on mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures are to be expected.
The force of friction is less on icy and snowy roads, you can't drive the car the same way you would on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you in one place.
Visibility may also be limited due to snow, sleet, condensation on car windows, or ice cover.
Icy and snowy conditions, on the other hand, are common occurrences in many countries and do not cause traffic disruptions throughout the year.
In Africa, safari tourism is probably the biggest spectacle and attraction for many visitors.
The term "safari," in popular usage, refers to a land journey in African wildlife areas, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and it is perfectly possible to view them with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, monkeys, and leopards are very shy, and you can only get a good look at them with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "bushwalking," "tramping," or "trekking") involves hikes lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, and several events will take place in various locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the first Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before postponing them, you may be in a difficult situation.
The imposed restrictions vary in different cases, however, according to the latest information from March, most of the restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus will not be extended until July 2020, by which time the Olympics were scheduled.
Likely, the price of most tickets to attend the event will fluctuate between 2500 and 130,000 yen, while the price of standard tickets will be around 7000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for temporary use if it is not in the room.
If you have an iron, or if you don't like wearing un-ironed socks, in such a case, if possible, you can try using a hair dryer.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, damage).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you don't like any of them, then buy water in a sealed bottle from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they didn't know existed in their native regions.

The stirrup holds the rider's feet dangling on either side of the saddle.
They offer riders more security, but there is a safety risk that riders' feet may get stuck in them.
In the event that a horse throws a rider in such a way that their foot remains trapped in the stirrup, the horse may drag the rider if it bolts. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English ones, have a safety bar that allows the leather of the stirrup to come off the saddle if the rider pulls back on it when falling from the horse.
Cochamo Valley is a major rock climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America for its diverse granite walls and boulders.

The development of downhill skiing as a sport began no earlier than the 17th century, while in 1861 Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is called ski mountaineering, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is associated with, but not usually related to, alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being carried out on steep terrain and requiring sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine ski routes as hiking trails.
In good conditions, you can cover a greater distance than when walking, but it's very rare to achieve all-terrain ski speeds on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, although it encompasses many independent countries. Traveling through numerous countries, under normal circumstances, involves obtaining visas and going through passport control multiple times.
In this regard, the Schengen Zone operates as one country.

Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their personal space and dignity untouched.
A strong undertow is a return flow from waves that crash forcefully onto shores, often reefs, or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, downwelling concentrates in slightly deeper sections, and from here a faster flow can form in the direction of deep water.
The cause of death is usually exhaustion from swimming against the current, which may even be impossible.
Once you get away from the current, returning becomes more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a spot where the waves still can't catch you, or depending on your abilities, and if you've been noticed, you might want to wait for lifeguards.
Reverse culture shock tends to set in faster than culture shock (with less of a "honeymoon phase"), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
