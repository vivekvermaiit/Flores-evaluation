This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, this animal's feathers were brown on the upper part and pale or yellowish on the lower part.
The invention also gives an idea of the development of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed feather vane, which is called a rachis, but possess other feather features such as barbed rami and barbules, researchers hypothesized that the rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers suggest that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult plumage, not down.
Researchers hypothesize that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult plumage and not that of a hatchling.

Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less magnetically active the star is in terms of reversals.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would arise from tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon affects the Earth with its gravitational pull, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy surrounds it in the form of a halo and is made up of many small particles.

Infrared images of temperature fluctuations from night to day suggest that these are likely caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly stable temperature, but it is consistent with deep pits in the ground," said Glendon Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally carried out using simple technologies: voters isolate themselves in a voting booth, put a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the official verifies the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
France's electoral law rather strictly codifies campaign materials.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes have been added, except for those properly counted and given to voters.
Candidates may send representatives to be personally present at every stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

His first competition was a ski race, where his first run was marked as "Did Not Finish." 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her next giant slalom race in the sitting women's group, she finished tenth, with a combined run time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the result of Austrian Claudia Lösch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the result of Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
In a group of seated women, four skiers failed their race, and in the giant slalom, 45 out of 117 skiers failed to place in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered and returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Aryan said, "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused had come to court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, she was transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, located in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of murdering his son.
He was in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be compromised because his image had been widely publicized.
Generally, this is a widespread practice in Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts view the publication of photos as potential prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are putting themselves at risk by publishing photographs and other materials of suspects."
The Royal Office, which has overall responsibility for conducting prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until an indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document concerns a border dispute. Palestine wants the borders to be based on those that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
As reported, other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the treaty is signed, while the competent Palestinian authorities agree to allow such a presence for only five years.
During the supplemental pest control trial, the shooters were under the direct supervision of the forest rangers, as the trial was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters' Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four rangers selected for the initial shooting operation had undergone comprehensive safety and training courses.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in to the new Provisional Electoral Council consisting of nine people.
That's the fifth package from Martel's Mail Express in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the ruling power that had begun in October.
Sometimes the failure to hold elections became a motive for fierce demonstrations, some dating back to 2011.
Approximately 60 cases have been reported regarding iPod overheating malfunctions, resulting in six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it was aware of 27 incidents related to devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "frivolous."
The ministry responded, calling the delay of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday evening).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management reported that no damage has been recorded in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and it has been confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six prisoners, including children and adults, had been released earlier, as had the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an old woman when she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was killed by a gunshot.
The Higginses followed in their father's footsteps and chose the medical profession.
She had retrained as a midwife and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
According to her research, fetal lung maturation can be accelerated with the administration of a single hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered both 'black boxes' of the flight voice recorder.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna was crazy like me... maybe even more so... that loves her and will miss her...hoping she is in a better place."
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign, argued that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of survey participants share this view: they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the latest survey, 29% of respondents believed that Australia would become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia would never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three medley races, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He hadn't been able to take the necessary pills to overcome his pain, as they are banned by the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software before the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets were likely a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic materials that could have formed proteins and supported survival.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He presented the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
"NextGen" is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States, will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older land-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to spot aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking, vehicle drop-off, and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable.
Fears about the lack of transportation increased the likelihood that they would have to hold the game behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal *Science* on Thursday reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations due to interbreeding between Darwin's endemic finch, the medium ground finch, and the large cactus finch, *Certhidea olivacea*, even though this process was thought to take much longer.
Gold can be shaped into any form. It can be rolled into small molds.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and inserted into another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical composition is.
In the tested chemical composition, the pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (the quantity of H in the pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away from them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry eyeshadows together, and then with clean, damp hands, compress it until it becomes a ball.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers, which will be ridiculous and create a kind of shield.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been discovered in the homes of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in the same place.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
In space, the satellite receives the call and echoes it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. In space, scientists use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
A massive 100-foot-long rocket is necessary to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done is provide us with easier and faster transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
The majority of them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to deer and roe deer.
And finally, there are very small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that prey on a much wider variety of small victims, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept: each cat has a specific job that keeps it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of the cat species, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult males who are related by blood, and they may be accompanied by more than thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually more warmly connected to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act more like wolf or dog packs, with the animals behaving surprisingly similarly to lions (but not other big cats) and also being very deadly to their prey.
A well-developed athlete, the tiger can climb (true, not that well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like a sentence of growling, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. When possible, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are relatively smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey by scent, sniffing the ground in all the places they have been.
With their night vision, they can see very well and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), then they will invariably find themselves in a different environment from their previous one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics and adaptability than were previously required to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all; they need the same accommodations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they like the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that it will no longer be possible to call them the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create oxygen, which people breathe, and they inhale carbon dioxide, which people exhale (that is, breathe the air out).
Plants get their nourishment through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws held over 70 razor-sharp teeth, with an additional row in the upper part of its mouth, meaning that anything crossing its path could not escape it.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been cannibalistic.
It would attack anything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, was nothing to it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans consumed strange or unusual parts of animals, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another version was that while poor men and women sat on chairs eating their bread, the rich loved to organize banquets together, where they would recline as they ate their dishes.
Ancient Roman dishes could not include foods that came from Europe, America, or Asia in ancient times.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The inhabitants of Babylon built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and celebrations.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, where only priests may enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called "ziggurats" were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not of such great importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking in the yard, and the shops were open storefronts facing directly onto the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive there.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norwegian saga writers state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered it and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," the differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were numerous.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," then you might think that a treasure map was depicted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite the fact that something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches long by 24½ inches wide) was previously in storage.
Therefore, it's possible the notation was added as a direct trademark.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. They were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies conquered Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and French independent forces had liberated southern France and were changing direction towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a fairly large group of people – a society – living together and cooperating.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis," which means "civilized," which is related to the Latin word "civis," meaning "citizen," and the word "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and this also somehow defines the scope of society.
City-states are prototypes of nations. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge between several generations, a long-lasting cultural footprint, and the fair distribution of information.
Small cultures often disappear, leaving behind no relevant historical evidence, and thus are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies initially established a weak central government where Congress was its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and since there was no executive or judicial national body, it relied on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate in enforcing all its laws.
It also did not have the authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states didn't take the central government seriously enough, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, jointly with the Germany national football team, the second most successful team in the world and the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more common in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world.
Thanks to Japan's cluster/group of islands, from a geographical point of view, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginning is considered to be the 15th century, when European sailors passing through the area recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the indigenous people's grain cultivation practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty's (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was proclaimed a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for photographic still images in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size near the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but most importantly, its width-to-height ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat misleading, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve in order to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is, as they say, 3:2.
Numerous common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often-violated and frequently mocked Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism by maintaining proportional relationships within an image.
It notes that the most effective part of the main subject is the intersection point of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, had come under scrutiny during this period of European history.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power had an impact on everyone, from the king to the common mortal.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central structure of the Church was in Rome for about a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was being maintained.
Immediately after the start of the atrocities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective by halting the supply of vital military and civilian goods, although this blockade violated universally accepted international law, enshrined in several international agreements adopted over the last two centuries.
Britain was mining international waters, preventing any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since this tactic met with a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine fleet conducting unrestricted warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among many citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, countries wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former work supervisor) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China employed a unique way of representing different periods; each period of a family at the head of China or in power was considered a separate dynasty.
It was also an unstable period of provinces divided between dynasties. The most famous of these periods was the "Three Kingdoms" era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce military actions took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying as they fought for control of the highest throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are a number of social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just one ruler.
Besides that, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applied to the military, as instead of a class-based army hierarchy, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed representatives of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions beyond this worldly life. To contemplate, he often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (Light).
The cave that has survived the times vividly reflects Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Resting atop one of the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is entirely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if someone knows it existed. At one time, inside the cave, it was complete isolation.
Besides the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding numerous mountains, nothing else can be seen. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands.
The Egyptians built the Great Pyramid in the third century BC; it is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau of the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, or the "Giza Necropolis," contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
"The 'up arc' symbol looks like a V, while the 'down arc' symbol looks like a square bracket or a square with the bottom side missing."
Up means you should start from the top and draw the bow, and down means you should start from the arrow rest (where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
A bow held high usually produces a softer sound, while a bow held low produces a louder and more assertive sound.
You can use a pencil for your own notes, but remember that the printed accidental signs are there for musical purposes, so they usually need to be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to flee Versailles to Paris as a result of an attack by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and making threats against the queen and king.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage window wide.
For a moment, a member of the mob brandished the head of a royal soldier killed in Versailles before the horrified queen.
The costs of the US imperialist war to occupy the Philippines were paid by the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to reimburse the bulk of interest and expenses on bonds placed in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that contributed to the creation of that order.
The era when the events occurred is usually called the Early Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad chain of practical ideas, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to the very notion that human destiny progresses through an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and other manifestations of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technologies itself follows a path largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has inherent "impacts" on societies rather than being conditioned by society.
For example, one could say that a motor vehicle inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network spread throughout the country is not economically viable for just a small number of cars, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a large number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the discovery of new technologies in the healthcare sector to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism is a major element of cultural determinism, observed in writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with that geography were added; the latter, being in harmony with the wildness of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so too was Constantinople regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
As an epicenter of luxury, it became known around 400 AD and lasted approximately until 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its status declined, particularly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned, bringing with them gifts such as silks and spices that held more value than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that time that the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
In the initial period, Byzantine culture had a great influence on clothing in the East.
Anyway, thanks to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of that time was that buttons began to be used there to fasten clothing as a result of the Crusades.
The purpose of subsistence agriculture is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds specific to the ecological region, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, many farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this continues to be the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
The qualities that define a particular subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often signal their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, affectation, and the misuse of terms.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is the observation of several unfortunate cases of children who, having gone through neglect, hardship, and deliberate abuse by adults, were not socialized by adults as they aged.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, abandoning a child in this way has been due to the parent's rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe exploitation or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is believed that others were raised by animals; some are said to have lived independently in the wild.
When a feral child is raised by non-domestic animals, they exhibit behavior (physically) almost entirely similar to that of particularly cautious animals, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While coding courses should make learning easier and more engaging, code generation is a step too far.
Code generation is not a method of instruction, but rather an aid, supporting individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using new software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the person with the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to ask, suggest, and explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to overcome alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a number of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care for, and educate, yet such environments still exist.
We believe that the foster family system is considered a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The adoptive family is expected to provide for all the needs that the child did not receive in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristic of the internet leads to additional criteria from the perspective of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also considered "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as perspectives for having new motivations (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
The video recording led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial movements that last only milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out how people with an inability to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even noted that animals, such as domestic dogs, might also possess such abilities to interpret human behavior.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the changes existing between two unions of each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid requirements with the plant resources available.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been proteins, available in leaves and legumes, but as with us, they are difficult for primates to digest unless cooked.
Unlike animal products (ants, termites, eggs), the food is not only easier to digest, but also provides a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Taking all circumstances into account, we shouldn't be surprised to learn that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" somewhat in the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savanna.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking yourself up during your normal sleep period and then going back to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes later).
This can be easily done by using a relatively gentle alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you repeatedly change the alarm time while you are sleeping, then you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to wake up to urinate.
The degree of a person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the degree of tension present in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force becomes. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can acquire an education. The only thing hindering us from achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has spread through the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditations, and a path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga: through visualizing different deities, energetic pathways are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural clashes forced the countries to abandon the agreements reached.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last the next 40 years, and proxy, real armies were to fight battles from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans evaporated almost overnight when approximately 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods has long been the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the navy has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time hindering your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic military operation during World War II. The Americans, in an effort to help Britain, were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using its submarines, was trying to close this route.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to make milk, hair, meat, and skin readily available.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed in the hills or pastures, often followed by goatherds, who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the more widely spread shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons were made of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to reach greater speeds and haul heavier loads than was possible on the relatively uneven roads of the day.
The wooden sleepers of the railway were installed quite early to keep the railway tracks in place. However, it gradually became clear that the rails would be more effective if they were coated with iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron on the wooden wheels of the wagons caused more wear.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking, with human beings beginning to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more conscientiously with the environment, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can become advocates to reduce future suffering, even if only to some extent.
This is simply like treating the symptoms in many cases. In any case, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and eradicate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have increased even more as a result of overpopulation and people's unrestrained lifestyle.
When Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten copy, signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's shop-printing house.
During the night, 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlop broadsides."
On July 8th, the document was read aloud for the first time in public by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
To this day, the 25 lines of the Danelap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving examples of the document. The original manuscript copy has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things are said about the birds that are still likened to dinosaurs.
They have scales and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary digits.
The binary number system can only have one of two values, for example, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits, if we use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions regarding this poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in an official sense for this group of insects.
This term originated from an old acquaintance with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bedbugs are sedentary; they are adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
There are approximately 400,000 identified cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) scattered throughout the United States, which proves that it is still the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that negatively affects the nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely as men to hold a Master of Science degree.
The couple may decide that raising the child is not in their best interests or the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
During adoption, the parents who gave birth to the child relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides basic scientific research.
However, this is not merely an experiment, but an experiment is a test used to refute one or more plausible hypotheses through questions, and observations also guide research work.
Philosophers and natural scientists focused their attention on classical texts, and in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
Due to the decline in the knowledge of Greek, the West became detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have noted that the repetition of physiology and behavior is often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their creation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely a response to external periodic signals, have been documented for the majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle freely, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages and infections to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the portion of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural sites to enjoy the scenery as well as the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and studying the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small suburban towns to their workplaces, encountering on the road others whose workplaces are in the very towns they have just left.
Everyone on this fast commuter train is somehow connected to and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Science now proves that this massive carbon economy has deviated the biosphere from one of its stable states, which supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the state of transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges on this scale.
Why are transportation systems such a cause for complaint, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers unprofessional, or are more fundamental things happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior is impossible to predict with one hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to maintain a fairly stable distance, therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have some reasonable consistency and can be approximately mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three key characteristics: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily escape predators, find food, and locate mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wide variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought the opposite, that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water than the second largest river on Earth.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its width reaching six miles in some sections.
A full 20 percent of the water from the planet's rivers that flows into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is approximately 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects the waters of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid structures made of stone have survived until the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world, with the fewest inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many of the workers in the country, while Latin is often used during religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
In the ancient world, people knew about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because these can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed a theory that everything is made of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also suggests that they morph into new materials, shaping what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures composed of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are unbelievably so small that trillions of them would fit within just the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pencil appeared, it was a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pencil has become less used and has acquired a lower status.
People now type messages on computer screens, never having to go near a typewriter.
One can only guess what the keyboard will be like when something newer appears.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to bind together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill: splitting the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are prone to disintegrating with little or no prompting.
The Moon's surface is composed of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The outer crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner in water and thicker in the mountains.
There might be more eruptions on this side because the outer crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to burst out onto the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people to make a choice or what seems attractive to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature.
These theories are aimed at discovering what makes certain people want to do the things they do, and what environmental factors will make them do or not do certain things.
The two well-known theories of motivation are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys (or girls)."
This type of leader has difficulties making decisions that are unpopular with the people, implementing disciplinary actions, conducting performance-related evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a creature transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has done and take their own steps.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes conflict between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones, which can be difficult for their local management to understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can manifest themselves if all available resources in the organization's functional operating divisions are used effectively.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that will serve the customer's needs.
Before any organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as general knowledge and organizational learning.
Angele (2006) explains the Continuous Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, consequently narrowing the scope of study and making it much more precise.
The interplay between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the brain's structure and processes in ways we've never been able to before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build modeling examples that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has strong science fiction connotations, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and devices intelligently adapting.
Artificial intelligence research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, scheduling, and agenda setting, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Things like this become separate scientific fields that focus on providing solutions for real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields because they have been created in several computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any course. Very often, the teacher would like to take their students to places where it is not possible to go by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can view cultural artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire magnificent art, all while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing about the excursion is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a webpage about their visit to the state capitol, and every year the webpage is transformed, but the old versions are kept online as a log.
Blogs can also be helpful in improving students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers fundamentally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger is starting to struggle to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to be more perceptive of the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the boundaries of the traditional school day.
The regular use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding more actively to online material, students can define their positions within the context of others' writings, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city, adorned with art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and the areas that extend beyond it.
All of this, and certain other things, highlight Ontario as what is considered by outsiders to be an exemplary Canadian city.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited deserts.
To put the population into perspective, which surprises many, there are more African Americans living in the US than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, undoubtedly, the largest and a unique continent in terms of its wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are attached to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, and it has come a long way in the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women are advised that any traveling woman should say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also beneficial (just not one that is excessively expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can result in what they might consider harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be decisive in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether it's a cultural difference or not, got it?).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Beida, and the Spanish traders, who were establishing trading bases there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco from a shopping perspective.
It is not difficult to find places in Medina where they sell traditional Moroccan items, such as tagine dishes, earthenware, leather goods, hookahs, and a huge assortment of pendants, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, covering most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma itself is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of military operations ongoing in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as tracking some of the cheapest mountain gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The typical (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
With its aura of inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but despite this, its reputation makes it attractive to tourists and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the danger of the desert sands.
That was one of Henry Louis's main stops during PBS's "Wonders of the African World" special.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arabic feel than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends east along the Mozambique border, north to Zimbabwe, and its southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different branches of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier tourist destinations and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, conservation and daily entrance fees apply.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry into various South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is a major focal point for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that shapes Hong Kong's skyline resembles a shimmering graphic, made prominent by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, get out of the island and head to the opposite side, the Kowloon Waterfront.
The main part of Hong Kong Island's urban development, densely populated, is on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonists considered their own, so if you're looking for evidence of this location's colonial past, this is a good area to start.
The Sundarbans are considered the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast across Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested area within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they include the last remnants of mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans area covers 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by aquatic/wetland areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been wildlife sanctuaries, and it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal royal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (along the river) throughout the day, although those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy your ticket in advance, a few days ahead of time.
Many areas are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Half-fare taxis are a quick and convenient way to visit nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two rows with a width of 3.5 meters.
The vertical crack under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was even closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs operations are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were among the most significant indigenous groups inhabiting present-day Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who practiced subsistence agriculture.
In the Chaco region, other groups of indigenous tribes lived, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
16th-century Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was created as a result of the clash between Spanish conquistadors and native Indian tribes.
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
When Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay was largely able to preserve its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known as one of the countries with the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Canitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and meetings are also held here during the other days of the year.
For information on where to purchase tickets for tournaments and polo games, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
It is possible to exchange currency at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, past the Falkland Islands Company's west store.
The British pound sterling is generally accepted throughout the islands, as are credit cards in Stanley. United States dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, but British and United States currencies may be; check with the owners beforehand to understand which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands pounds outside of the islands, so exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold; the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; according to rough estimates, the amount of rainfall remains the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the reserve's management, a distance of at least 100 yards/meters should be maintained from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, reindeer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can still attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't maintained a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Besides that, be aware that bears and other wildlife are attracted to scents, so avoid having or preparing smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu, and the population is less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was a site of inglorious maritime inactivity in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans died.
Supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed as a result of peaceful gatherings taking place in the city during the Mau movement's organized independence struggle.
There are many beaches in Auckland due to the two harbors that encompass both sides. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the Northern Harbour area) are on the coast of the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are all safe swimming sandy beaches and most have shady areas provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes bustling family beaches with numerous diverse shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", it's a simple beer, but with a pleasant and refreshing character. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that one should have, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better consumed.
The local tap water is perfectly drinkable, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the idea of coffee "with milk" is foreign. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino is served with thick cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is excellent, even by Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but taste amazing.
Many trips to underwater reefs take place throughout the year, and injuries on underwater rocks due to any of these reasons are very rare.
As before, listen to the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and be attentive to safety signals.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of these time periods.
Sharks really do exist, but they rarely attack people. Many sharks are afraid of people and swim far from the shore.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live only in the ocean; their primary habitats are the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often make deals with specific hotels, although you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your chosen location.
Despite any changes and requests, they must first be studied through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a significant majority of visitors decide to camp at the location, and many visitors consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the concert, you need to get in early so you can set up your tent close to the music.
Remember, even if the music has ended on the main stages, there may be some sections of the festival that will continue the music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas designated for families with young children.
If you've decided to cross the Northern Baltic in winter, check the position of your cabin, as passing through the ice causes quite a terrifying noise for the most susceptible.
A St. Petersburg cruise also includes leisure time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into making guests spend more time and money. Clocks and windows are usually absent, and the exit is difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to ensure guests are in good spirits and to keep them inside the building.
In some places, they offer alcoholic beverages right in the house. However, drunkenness clouds judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is low, and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In the event of a blizzard, a lot of snow can fall in a very short time and bury you.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing on the vehicle's windows, or by them becoming foggy, or by ice on them.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are natural in many countries, and traffic continues throughout the year, mostly uninterrupted.
Safaris are probably the biggest incentive bringing tourists to Africa and the destination for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used for overland travel to observe impressive African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, typically approach vehicles, and standard equipment will offer the opportunity to see them up close.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs are sometimes shy, and it's better to see them through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "safari hike," or "on foot safari") involves hikes lasting either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Several events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, which were held in 1964.
If you booked your tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, not all cancellations due to coronavirus are being extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for many of the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, while standard tickets will cost 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes will help dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for rent, even if one isn't included in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then, if possible, you can try a hairdryer.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are different methods for purifying water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in other places, it takes several minutes to do so.
Filters vary in their efficiency, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pest animals in their places of accommodation.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.

The stirrups, which hang from either side of the saddle, protect the rider's legs.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can have safety concerns, as there is a possibility that the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse, but his foot remains in the stirrup, the horse can drag him if it runs away. A number of precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
First, all riders wear riding boots with a heel and a flat, fairly narrow sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle when a falling rider pulls back on it.

Alpine skiing sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiastic people, known as "ski fanatics," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old; cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5,000 years before the birth of Christ.
Skiing originates from at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski mountaineering: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski randonnée.
That's related to alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, but they are usually not included, as the latter are done in steep places, and they require much sturdier skis and boots.
Accept the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than walking, but only very rarely will you achieve cross-country skiing speeds on prepared ski trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean applying for visas multiple times and going through passport control procedures.
However, in this regard, the Schengen Area functions like a single state.
As long as you are staying in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you won't need to apply for a visa separately to each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods constitute antiques. Some tax agencies classify goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition depends on geographical variations, where the epoch boundary may be smaller in North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted items can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people and the surrounding culture, and trade is also important for many with other professions.

The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and then different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by a number of countries and have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano creates a magnificent natural harbor scene.
Ellsworth Land is the region in the south of the peninsula, which is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merge, becoming a plateau, then reuniting to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountains of Antarctica are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range: the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson with a height of 4892 m.
In remote locations where cellular service is unavailable, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Overall, a satellite phone does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be in an open space with a clear view of the antenna to make phone calls.
The service is often used for freight transportation, including yachts, as well as by expeditions whose data is received remotely and have voice needs.
The telephone company that provides services in your area should be able to give you more information about signing up for this service.

Shipping companies are well paid for delivering goods quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, commerce, or urgent repair parts.
For some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller firms, this has been a problem.
If they send the goods by air freight, on some routes it can take days to go through customs and unloading.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline's regulations wouldn't allow them to send luggage to the visiting country without the passenger.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to spend a lot of money for that privilege (or, better yet, convince your company to do it for you).
Nevertheless, this isn't cheap; as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more for business class than for economy class, and up to eleven times more for first class.
Generally speaking, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
