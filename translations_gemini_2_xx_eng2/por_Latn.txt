This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well-accepted, but also offers details that are not found as frequently in fossils, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists state that the upper plumage of this animal was brown, and the lower part was light or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers, known as rachis, do not have a well-developed shaft, but they do possess other characteristics, such as barbs and barbules. In light of this, researchers have concluded that the rachis was possibly the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for display or temperature regulation. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, not that of a hatchling.
The researchers suggested that, despite the tail being from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not downy feathers.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They discovered that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to define a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo and is composed of numerous tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He warned in an interview that the new variant was "very concerning and alarming due to the high mortality rate."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least two were healthcare professionals.
Over a period of one year, one infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.

Infrared images show that the day-to-night temperature variations indicate they are likely caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on planet Earth, which tend to preserve a very constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters seclude themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officers verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law codifies procedures in a rather rigorous manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelope is present at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added, except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process. Overnight, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

Four skiers from the women's group failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
"The accused appeared in court with his face covered," declared Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Despite three people being inside the house when it was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, observes that "journalists seem to be heading in a dangerous direction when they publish photos, videos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the proceedings, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other issues covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control test were under close supervision by the forestry engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, in accordance with the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage for National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to advance the country towards new elections.
The commission was the response given by Martelly to the widespread protests organized against the regime. The demonstrations began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as far back as 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods with overheating issues have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI disclosed that Apple had informed it of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company classified as "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report postponement "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time. In GMT, it was on Friday at 09:19 PM.
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office said there were no reported damages in the country.
Additionally, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Afterwards, the photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained himself as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Although he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
Your research demonstrated that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal pulmonary maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes," flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin Goldust Runnels said, "Luna was as crazy as me... or maybe even more so... I loved her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated, during the 2010 campaign for the national election, that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey share this view, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was called into question.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, as it is banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water distribution to Earth along with organic matter that could develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politicking and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older, ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no extra transport, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parks and connections to public transport will not be available.
The transportation issues have increased the possibility of the game being held behind closed doors, without fans in attendance.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the US, and Uppsala University in Sweden, reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any kind of shape. It can even be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be stretched to form a thin wire and can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and glued to another metal. Because it is so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture from the hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the homes of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 30 meters tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel did for us was give us much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and various other forms of transportation.
Below them are the mid-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that prey on much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche, a special role that each cat fulfills which prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
The groups consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and offspring.
Women tend to be closely connected to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like a phrase of shouted and growled words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey by scent, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and can also move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they go to an island from which it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they inhabited before.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from those they already possess and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., expire).
Plants use sunlight as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses using plants and make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its era, so the only thing it feared was other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, which shows that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would be no match for him.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that, while the poor and women ate seated on chairs, wealthy men liked to hold banquets together where they reclined on their sides while having their meals.
Food in ancient Rome did not include ingredients originating from the Americas and Asia to Europe, as happened in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which were considered the home of their respective god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had a sparse colonization. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling west, found Greenland and gave it that name.
But, regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears in the lower corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that, early in its existence, the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French "Vichy" regime. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large, significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also, in a way, defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. The culture of a civilization implies the passing on of knowledge through different generations, a lasting cultural reach, and a fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who generally did not cooperate, to enforce all of its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent among all states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful in the world, and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical context, as an "archipelago."
The founding of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing through the region named the place Ilha Formosa (Beautiful Island).
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the complex's perimeter were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and this restoration continues to this day.
As an example, the most common still image photography format on the planet is 35mm, which was the film size most widely in circulation at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the smallest ratio between whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same as, or very close to, this aspect ratio.
The often abused and frequently demoralized rule of thirds is a fairly simple guideline that provides dynamism while maintaining relative order within a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
All were affected by his influential power, from the king to the commoner.
One of the core Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for that reason.
The church's central leadership had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether that principle was being upheld.
Soon after the start of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies to military personnel and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international regulations laid out in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, bringing danger even to ships flying neutral flags.
Germany, having seen a limited response to that tactic, anticipated an attack similar to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States penniless, with a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer's boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, a fierce war occurred between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, positions were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applied to the military, since instead of ranks being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Resting on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find it, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Nothing can be seen beyond the clear blue sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, features several pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arch pointing upwards" mark looks similar to a V, and the "arch pointing downwards" mark looks similar to a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow; down means you should start at the frog (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
Generally, an up bow produces a softer sound, while a down bow produces a louder and more assertive sound.
You can write your own bowings, but don't forget that the printed bowings exist for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (eleven-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a demonstrator waved the head of a dead royal guard from Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on floating-rate bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
It is clear that the super-profits originating from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which such events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages was preceded by the Late Antiquity and followed by the High Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas in practice, from the offering of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share 2 general ideas: the first is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning an automobile.
Mass car ownership leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare system to heal injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Geography, within the context of Romanticism, shaped citizens, and over time, customs and culture linked to that geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the society's location, became superior to eventually obligatory laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this period that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic script reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and also in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began developing its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to close their garments.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic, system that uses native seeds saved from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or sex of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to turn to the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of these children were confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children was due to the parents' rejection of the child because of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are rebellious may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood, before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is assumed that others were created by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the jungle.
When completely raised by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal foster parent, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or in-person; in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that talking paperclip from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software with the aim of questioning, alerting, and explaining procedures that students might find challenging to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care for, and educate, but it happens.
We see the Foster Care System as a safe haven for these children.
Our adoption platform has a duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education, and guaranteed medical care.
Foster care is supposed to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaching uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "relationships with continuity" were also identified as new characteristics of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when studying public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that a person can detect if another person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, nevertheless, able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such human behavior interpretation skills may be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
20th-century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: cryptic and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans, consuming the available plant resources, to satisfy its amino acid requirements.
Furthermore, failure to act accordingly leads to serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
More accessible plant-based resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us primates to digest unless they are cooked.
However, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking all of this into account, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" more or less as present-day savanna chimpanzees do.
Sleep fragmentation is a process that consists of waking up intentionally during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep soon after (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a fairly quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without fully waking him up.
If you find yourself snoozing the alarm while still half asleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace is inversely correlated with their level of bodily and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing hindering that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they have been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the disintegration of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years, and indeed, there would be leadership training of replacement troops on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed, and the only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to move people and goods while, at the same time, interfering with their enemies' ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At that very moment, the German navy organization, primarily using U-boats, was trying to put an end to that traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have had the capacity to conquer Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century onwards.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads on the somewhat rougher roads.
Sleepers (or railroad ties) were implemented very early on to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal cap on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as a matter of course.
Bipedal adaptations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have walked upright, on two legs, much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
That's exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want to have just a temporary solution, we must find the origin of the problems and eliminate them.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of the human race, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and man's extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6th, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet with claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The biggest sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects well-structured to cling to humans.
Both kissing bugs and barnacles are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest, or in their child's best interest.
Such couples have the permission to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It is, in fact, not only experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions. Making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including his psychology.
As knowledge of Greek receded, the West found itself distanced from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Various rhythms observed in physiology and behavior typically rely fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not strictly responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a continuous cycle period, even without environmental interference.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, marking either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave the small towns inland to go to work in other cities, and they encounter other people who work precisely in those small towns they left.
On this dynamic transit bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a transportation system based on private cars.
Science today indicates that this carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone also complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design, and operations of road infrastructure facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because the planet Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes almost 10 km wide.
A total of 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size or in technical construction excellence.
The people of ancient Egypt in the New Kingdom marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which were by then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most who work in the state, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so astonishingly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a less important role and use.
Nowadays, people write messages using computer screens and don't need to get near a pencil sharpener.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works based on the principle that energy is required to build a nucleus with multiple protons and neutrons.
It's sort of like pushing a heavy cart uphill. The splitting of the nucleus then releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no encouragement.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people possess certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what it is about certain people that makes them want what they want, and what things in their environment will cause them to do, or not do, certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former coworkers. One side of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys (or girls)."
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct performance reviews, delegate, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has been doing and do their own thing.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams must maintain the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may be located in different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member must report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning? One of the practical goals of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity shine through.
As a result, an organization's teamwork process to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new, innovative process that meets the customer's need.
Even before an organization can be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data offer physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between cerebral and behavioral pathology provides a basis for scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our minds.
Despite AI having a strong connotation with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves producing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to address customer issues and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice, and speech recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. From the classroom, students can see museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a yearbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Since students often start their engagement with blogs using poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by interacting with internet content actively, students can position themselves within the context of others' writings, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, boasting a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is further south; meanwhile, the north boasts the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Due to all of this and much more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated, and some are practically uninhabited wilderness.
For comparison purposes regarding population, which surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which gained much popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all travelers say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts that they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when refusing men. Don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether due to cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historical part of Medina, it's easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole bunch of trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the battle that persists in the Nord-Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, given its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' program Wonders of the African World, broadcast on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country because it has more of an Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, along the Mozambique border to the east, the Zimbabwe border to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and conservation of the park, as is the case with all South African national parks.
It can also be very useful to acquire a Wild Card. With it, you can have access to several parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the place that many tourists consider its main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph made visible by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront, on the opposite side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the place that British colonizers chose to live, and so, if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching for about 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests aren't just made up of mangrove swamps - they hold some of the last great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², with one-third of it being covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
There are several bus departures from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Since interdistrict buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal micro-buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, in Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to become operational in September 2017, the expected date for completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is today eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," emerged from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in maintaining many of its indigenous populations' characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To stay updated on tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be received. Please check with the owners in advance to find out which method of payment they accept.
It is practically impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There aren't particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, moose, and bears, like all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so don't get close.
Furthermore, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals; therefore, avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a well-known naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Almost 200 German and American lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is quite safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It's not a complex beer, but it's enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines might go down easier.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you're concerned.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is an "espresso", a cappuccino comes topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes that occur on the reef are rare.
Continue to heed the authorities' reminders, obeying all signs, and paying close attention to safety alerts.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actively live in the ocean. Their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often have business relationships with specific hotels, even though it's likely possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They can also guarantee your booking if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, if you have any changes or requests, these should first be directed to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most of them consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive earlier to be able to camp near the music.
Remember that even after the music ends on the main stages, some sections of the festival may continue playing late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's location, as crossing the ice generates a terrible noise for the more sensitive.
St. Petersburg cruises include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos typically make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. Generally, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them on-site.
Some places offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good bettors know the importance of staying sober.
Whenever someone is driving in high latitude areas or on mountain roads, they should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the friction is low, and you can't drive as if you were on clear asphalt.
During blizzards, it's possible for enough snow to fall to leave you stranded in a very short time.
Visibility may also be reduced due to falling or blowing snow, or condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the apple of many visitors' eyes.
The term "safari," in its colloquial use, refers to overland trips to observe the impressive African wildlife, mainly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the basic equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
Also known as a "bush walk," "walking safari," or "foot safari," a walking safari is essentially hiking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in more serious cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, many minutes are necessary.
The quality of filters varies, and if you're unsure, it might be a good idea to consider buying water jugs from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in the regions they come from.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people through force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the chance to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, who frequently pass through isolated backcountry areas.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections – commonly 55-65 km/h – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good, and in Bavaria, they are particularly elaborate and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit desserts are common, with baked apples in sweets year-round, and cherries and plums making an appearance during the summer.
Many goods from German bakeries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The famous cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, might be called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a spectrum encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant Javanese preferred condiments being peanuts, chilies, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are used to support a rider's feet, hanging down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety problems because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one of their feet caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the animal ends up fleeing. To reduce this danger, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, a large portion of riders use riding boots with a heel and a smooth sole, which is quite narrow.
Next, some saddles, mainly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to come off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
As Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The meetings include exciting views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are continually establishing new routes among its infinite potential of rock faces.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important activity on trips for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations just to ski in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegian citizens in Australia.
Ski touring: an activity also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It's related, but generally doesn't involve tourism for alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover slightly greater distances than on foot—but you'll only very rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions as a single country in this respect.
If you stay in this area, it's possible to cross the border without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, holding a Schengen visa means you won't need to apply for visas for each Schengen Area member country separately, thus saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition specifying which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of livelihood among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many other classes of professionals.
Although it is a tradition, not all Sami people participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, mainly using reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you will be visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
It is also recommended that you consult with other governments besides your own, but their advice is tailored to their respective citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may experience different situations than those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The viewpoints presented are usually superficial, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and encompasses different types, which vary depending on geographic location, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include snowfalls, as well as snow, ice, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of inclement weather in their region, as this may affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, a person should first receive professional training.
An internet search for 'Hostile environment course' will typically point to the address of a company in the region.
A course will typically cover all the topics discussed here in significantly more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course typically lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves role-playing, various first aid techniques, and, sometimes, weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with jungle survival are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad should ensure they are carrying valid travel documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with undefined gender (X), or updated documents to reflect a preferred name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies widely.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had gender reassignment surgery should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the backwash of wave water on the beach returning to the sea, usually in a reef or similar area.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow becomes concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid current towards deep water can form there.
Most deaths result from exhaustion due to trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you manage to get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it usually would be.
Try to aim from somewhere where you can't be caught, or, depending on your skills or if you've been detected, wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock happens sooner than culture shock (the "honeymoon" period is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapted easily to the new culture sometimes have a particular difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
Returning home after living abroad, you've adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your local culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People don't realize that patience and understanding are also essential for travelers returning home.
In the children's area, one of the most interesting things is the pyramid's light and sound show.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in the silence before the show starts.
Normally you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is defined as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, coastal to the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the Peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace a cell phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors with a view of the satellite.
The service is frequently used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone company may be able to offer more information about connecting to this service.
A increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a year off before university without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can, in fact, increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Typically, there will be an enrollment fee to register for these educational programs.
For those who enjoy boat trips, Finland is a great destination. In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but a rather characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for two full days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only embark on sea excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Shipping companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important when sending business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they shipped things by air freight, depending on the route, it can take days to arrive at the destination and clear customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is by shelling out a large amount of money for the privilege (or, even better, having your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more compared to a regular economy fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, it's not even worth looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there's a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The country's language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria) in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations were restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are punctuated by traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century marketplace, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than classical Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on people's tombs.
It's worth walking half an hour through the intriguing village.
To the north, and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a glowing account of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb bus 403 travels to Sintra frequently, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the grand Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (Reliquary), a place famous worldwide for Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a giant cemetery, as well as a place that holds virtually incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many others, both Jewish and non-Jewish, whose loved ones were murdered or worked to death there.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by staining or cracking the buildings with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, a large portion understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, because this is the language that was established by law as the official language.
Even so, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the subway are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an unhelpful stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still good behavior, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make the trip considerably easier.
The Parisian's brusque exterior will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mainly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to the varied microclimates, different soils, and different altitude levels.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals can be found there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and capercaillies, as well as various other common species.
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and must also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide clothing for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own attire, especially in bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants covering their knees.
Borrowed clothes are available at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, there's only one size!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and whatever ingredients are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, together with the word "Sie" (for you, formal), always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, without a doubt, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out if a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized way.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are C and G, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar guide will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish may prematurely conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated nowadays and remain in museums or schools.
Since light pollution wasn't a problem in their heyday, they are often found in cities or university campuses, which are easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas that have favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" seedling.
Visiting a formally arranged garden to collect "specimens" will also get you kicked out, no questions asked.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe and very easy place to explore, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the Equator, you'll need to deal with both the (constant) heat and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less often).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take goes all the way to Hebron, and not just to the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, visit the Loire Valley castles, the Upper Middle Rhine Valley, take a boat trip to the Danube's highlights, or sail along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the holiday's traditions have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake somewhere outdoors to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of Spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches usually hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend. Congregations often break the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky gets dark around the right time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and consequently light pollution isn't a problem, you'll also be able to enjoy the stars.
In Japan, labor-management cultural relations are more based on hierarchy and formality than Westerners are accustomed to seeing.
Suits are the standard attire in business, and colleagues address each other by their last names or titles.
Workplace harmony is crucial, emphasizing teamwork over highlighting individual achievements.
Workers generally require approval from their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
