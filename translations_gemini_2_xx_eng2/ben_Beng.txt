This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, bolstering a widespread theory, but the fossils are unable to provide detailed information, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists have said that the upper part of this animal's feathers was brown in color, and the inner color was pale or similar to carotene.
The investigation also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have well-defined central shafts, known as rachis, but the feathers did possess another characteristic - barbs and barbules - researchers speculate that the rachis was likely one of the features that emerged later as a result of evolutionary advancement.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the downy feathers of a juvenile.
According to researchers, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of adults rather than small birds.

Most of the work completed was theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for occurred through the power flow between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on Earth that causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert pressure on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that just as ordinary matter affects each other, dark matter also affects other dark matter.
According to this theory, dark matter around a galaxy exists in a halo around the galaxy, and it is composed of numerous small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, mark their preferred candidate on a pre-printed paper, and place it in an envelope.
After verifying the voter's identity, the officials drop the ballot into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
French electoral law is rather strictly enforced.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those properly counted and belonging to recognized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, under heavy supervision, the votes are counted by volunteers following a special procedure.

Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the car driver has suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, although the driver was extracted from the red Audi TT for emergency services.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoa is in Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his own son.
He remains in custody pending charges and court proceedings, but eyewitness testimony may be tainted because his image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, and the court views the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes, "Publishing images of suspects forces journalists to walk a difficult path."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the investigation, has informed reporters that they will not comment on the matter until at least the case is closed.
According to leaked information, the document will mention the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders preceding the 1967 Middle East War.
Other news includes the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations and a solution to the problems of the Jordan Valley.
Following the signing of the agreement, Israel has demanded to maintain its current military presence in the valley for ten years, whereas the PA has only agreed to allow this presence for five years.
Supplementary pest control trials must be closely supervised by rangers with firearms, as the trial is being observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) INC, eligible volunteers were recruited into the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS Park Conservation Director and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received much more safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martley's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread protests against those in power that began in October is this commission.
The occasional intense protests had become even more intense due to the failure to hold the elections that had been stalled since 2011.
There have been about 60 reports of defective iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fire incidents and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that they are aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported information on 34 similar overexcitation incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report suspension "deeply regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management said that there were no reports of any damage to the public.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former police officer in the Philippines has hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and is holding them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and it has been confirmed that at least six people have been killed.
Besides the Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier.
Later, the photographer took the place of an old woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was then shot and killed.
Following his father, Ligins came into the medical profession.
She trained as a midwifery specialist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research shows that if a hormone is culturable, it will accelerate the maturation of the zygote's lung structure.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the plane's two 'black box' recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers even paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first director. Luna died on a two-moon night. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as whimsical as me... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a good place."
The number of those among the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share the same opinion: they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the final stages of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia will never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but after he reported his physical issues, doubts have arisen about his physical fitness and ability.
Being banned from sports, he became unable to afford the necessary medication to recover from his injury.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number at the time on January 25th.
In early February, numerous people verified this discovery using various types of hardware and software, and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water on Earth, as well as organic matter that could help form proteins and drive life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed into law a proposed bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed these rumors as "political babble and nonsense."
He is expected to be in the race to become a presidential candidate in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that helps aircraft fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-radar-based technology, allowing air traffic controllers to determine aircraft location more accurately and send pilots more precise information.
There is no extra transport running at Wembley, and Overground trains will not stop there, and there are no parking or driving facilities on the roads.
The fear of transport shortages has created the possibility that the game will be forced to be played behind closed doors, without any team supporters.
A research paper on the structure of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands was published in the journal Science Reports on Thursday.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is thought to take longer due to breeding between Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be twisted and turned to create small-scale designs.
It can be drawn into fine wires, which can be twisted and braided. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be applied very thinly to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether it is mixed with an acidic or alkaline (basic) chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions present in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are a type of proton that have had their electrons stripped away (hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Twist the two dry powders together, and then, with clean, damp hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel strange and create a kind of peeling.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in the Minoan houses of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in places like ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of bathhouses, where men and women used them together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite received the call in space and then immediately reflected it.
The satellite was launched into space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and view we receive.
It takes a giant 100-foot tall rocket to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has brought unprecedented change to the world. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to provide an easier and faster way of transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
They also have mid-sized cats under their control that prey on medium-sized game, ranging from rabbits to blackbuck and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (lost pet cats) that hunt very small prey, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a suitable niche, a specific task that protects each cat from competing with the others.
The lion is the most social cat, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult males along with thirty females and cubs.
Being a large family of sisters and daughters, the women are usually closely involved with each other.
The proud demeanor of a lion is strangely similar to that of a pack of wolves or dogs, animals whose behavior remarkably mirrors that of the lion (but not other big cats), and they are extremely deadly towards prey.
A complete and good athlete can ride a tiger (though not well), swim, jump quite far, and pull five times stronger than a strong man.
Like lions, cheetahs, and jaguars, tigers also belong to the genus Panthera. All four of these cat species can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather like a series of growls and snarls.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots prey on are much smaller than the ocelots themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt by tracking and smelling, where they sniff the ground to find animals while walking.
They have sharp eyesight in the darkness of night and move around silently. Ocelots blend in with their environment and hunt by pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms becomes separated from its main population (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are diverse resources and various competitors, so they require different characteristics or adaptations compared to before to become stronger competitors.
The actual population change hasn't happened at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time flows, new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, and their similarities with other populations begin to decrease.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which generally refers to the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (release during exhalation).
Plants make their food through photosynthesis using sunlight. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from trees. Most of our food is plant-based. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurs were the apex predators of their time, fearing nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over seventy razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning anything that fell in its path had no chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a barbed tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It would attack anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like a T-Rex would be no match for it.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans also ate strange or unusual foods as part of their meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, wealthy people preferred to eat together noisily and with fanfare, relaxing in the lounge while eating.
In the following century, ancient Roman food could not have included anything that came to Europe from America or Asia.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a special temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of that particular deity.
People brought sacrifices for the gods, and the priests tried to attend to the needs of the deities through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and a sanctuary inside, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped pillars were built as part of temples. These were called ziggurats.
The top of the pillar was the special abode of God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not particularly important.
The Hebrew family has spent most of their lives in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the stores looked like counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There wasn't any large forest in the countryside, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was settled in a haphazard way. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while sailing further west, he discovered Greenland and named the territory Greenland.
But, besides his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland regarding people, kings, customs, and history.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although, that's not true. Even so, there's some writing on the back of the document, but it's not a treasure map.
"The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776," with its words inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The writing appears on the bottom of the document's reverse side.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29 and three-quarters inches by 24 and a half inches) was rolled up for preservation in the early days.
Therefore, the mark was probably added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but southern France was not yet free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces attacked the southern part of France, an attack that was called "Operation Dragoon".
The American and Free French forces were liberating Southern France in just two weeks and advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture held by a significantly large population, who live in mutual cooperation and action within a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," meaning civil, related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and it also somehow describes the shape of society.
City-states are the precursors to states. A civilized culture refers to something that carries knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and just propagation.
It is often seen that the cultures of small ethnic or population groups lose relevance in history due to the lack of proper documentary recording. As a result, they do not gain recognition as so-called civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, under the Articles of Confederation, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - in which Congress was the sole branch.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, as there was no national executive or judicial committee at that time. The Congress relied on the state governments to impose and enforce taxes. On the other hand, the state governments mostly cooperated with them.
The states do not have the authority to waive taxes and duties.
The paragraphs needed the consent of all the states before amendments, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, jointly with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and it was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern countries due to the participation of Italians in the Olympics and various international competitions.
Japan consists of approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to its archipelago nature, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in terms of its geographical location.
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern region of Taiwan to transform the indigenous peoples' production methods and to employ Chinese laborers for rice and sugar cultivation.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty army (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures named Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
To give tourists a better idea of what it was actually like, most of the buildings along the edge of the complex have been reconstructed.
By 1976, approximately thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work is still ongoing.
For example, the common size for most still image photography in the world is 35mm, which was the most influential film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still made, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
Actually, the 35mm format is somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm long.
Therefore, the approximate ratio of this configuration is considered to be 3:2 (obtained by dividing by 12 to get a simple integer ratio).
Many common formats (for example, APS family formats) are equal to or close to the aspect ratio.
The deeply demeaning and almost laughable rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates a dynamic atmosphere in a picture by maintaining control of the composition.
It states that the most effective spot for the main subject is at the divisions of lines that divide the image into three parts, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic churches that had grown wealthy and powerful came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity bound the European nations together for thousands of years.
Its pervasive power influenced everyone from the king to the common person.
One of the core Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial resources are intended for that purpose.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church had been in Rome, and this abundance of power and wealth raised many questions about whether it was becoming credible.
Immediately after the outbreak of the war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy of cutting off crucial military and civilian supplies has been successful, although the blockade violates generally accepted international norms imposed by various international treaties over the past two centuries.
Unable to access the entire sea, Britain mines international waters, endangering even neutral ships.
Since this strategy had a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the people of most countries were primarily pacifist and isolationist in sentiment.
After witnessing the devastation and brutality of the First World War, all nations wanted to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America to see Thomas Edison with only 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods; each phase of China, or each family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, there was a period of instability in the provinces divided amongst each dynasty. The most well-known period of this time involved three phases of rule spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce battles among many nobles in the struggle for the throne.
Among the bloody eras of ancient Chinese history, the Three Kingdoms period was one of the most significant. During this time, thousands of people fought and died for the highest seat in the palaces of power in the city of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and not having a sole ruler in a republican country.
Simultaneously, professional opportunities were opened to all male applicants after the revolution, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same principle applies to the military because their army rankings are now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. For meditation, he would occasionally use a cave known as "Hira" (Diamond) on the "Noor" (Light) mountain.
He built the cave himself, which survived for a long time, providing a vivid reflection of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Resting on a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even though it exists, it's not at all easy to find. Once inside the cave, it's complete isolation.
Beyond the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, nothing else is visible. Very little of this world is heard or seen from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of only seven wonders that still stand today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of the Pharaoh.
The Giza Necropolis, located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to pay tribute to Khufu's wife and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like a V, and the "down bow" symbol looks like a staple or a square without the bottom.
"Up" means you should start from your end and push the bow, and "Down" means you should start from your frog (the place where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An up-bow generally produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to use a pencil on your own markings, but remember that Boeing's printed markings are there for instrumentation, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, due to a group of market women.
The king and queen were returning to Paris in a car amidst a crowd of agitated people shouting threats against them.
The excitable public forced the King and Queen to keep their car windows open.
At one point, someone from the agitated crowd dangled the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism, disguised as a victory for the Philippines, were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial government to obfuscate a large portion of expenses and bond interest in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Certainly, the super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would form a key foundation of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must first understand the context in which this group was formed.
The period in which these events occurred is generally known in European history as the High Middle Ages, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages began after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500 AD by convention.
Technological determinism is a term that can mean anything from the broad influence or push of technology to a strict idea that believes human destiny is governed by an inherent scientific law and its technological application.
Most technological determinism has two common interpretations: that technological development itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology then "impacts" societies, with the social conditions resulting from technology rather than the other way around.
For example, someone might say that automobiles essentially drive road development.
At the very least, a nationwide road network for a handful of cars is not economically feasible, therefore new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Increased car ownership among a majority of people raises the likelihood of road accidents, which in turn leads to the innovation of new strategies in healthcare for the treatment of injured individuals.
Romanticism from writers like Schlegel, Goethe, and Fichte was a major element in shaping the direction of culture.
In the context of romance, an individual geographically rooted fosters the customs and culture associated with that area over time, resonating with the society of that place, which is better than indiscriminately imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a hub of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its position declined during the twelfth century, mainly when crusaders brought gifts like silk and spices that were more valuable than those in the Byzantine markets.
It was from this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow pace of communication channels, practices in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own unique identity. As a result of the Crusades, the public's use of buttons to fasten clothing began, which was one of the biggest developments of that time.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of agriculture that produces just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
The farming that farmers do to meet their own needs is simple and often organic. To maximize yield, people in areas with similar temperature, humidity, and solar radiation, and similar geographical characteristics, cultivate by rotating crops with saved seeds or some other simple method.
In the past, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and that trend continues in several developing countries even today.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by the standards of social justice and help them build their identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of various matters.
Subculture members often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and dialect.
Some common methods of portraying the importance of socialization include creating unfortunate situations during children's upbringing such as neglect, unwanted behavior, and deliberate abuse, which prevent them from interacting with adults.
These types of children are called "feral" or wild. Some "feral" children are kept captive, usually by their own parents; in some cases, parental rejection due to the child's severe intellectual or physical disability leads to the abandonment of these children.
Before escaping or being abandoned, inexperienced children may have had to endure much abuse or trauma.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are known to live in the forest of their own accord.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child often exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) completely like those of the animal that nurtured it, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
Project-based learning makes studying easier and more engaging, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals who are acquiring new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both unreal or real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are embedded within this software. This software helps with all questions that are difficult for a single student to explain immediately and quickly.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and supportive, but they do.
We have realized that the foster care system is a safe space for children.
Our foster care system allows us to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Guardianship is supposed to provide all the necessary things that were lacking in the previous place.
The internet is a unified medium for both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the internet have added extra dimensions from the perspective of usage and gratification.
As an example, "education" and "socialization" are proposed as key motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
While examining audience response in websites, Aimee and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as new dimensions of motivation.
The use of video recording has led to significant innovations in interpreting facial movements, particularly fleeting micro-expressions lasting only milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can understand whether a person is lying by accurately identifying the subtle expressions on their face.
Oliver Sacks, in his letter concerning the President's address, alluded to the ability to accurately assess sincerity, even when an impairment in the brain renders one unable to comprehend the speech itself.
He even thinks that domesticated animals like dogs have this kind of ability to analyze human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two aspects of genetic variation: a hidden aspect and an expressed aspect.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the expressed variation.
Segregation and reconnection help to bring variation between the two pools of each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with human-like digestive systems to meet their amino acid requirements from readily available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so is exacerbating serious problems like depression and malnutrition, and causing premature deaths.
Leaves and legumes are the most readily accessible plant protein sources, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
Comparatively, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but it also provides a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna regions do now.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally staying awake during normal sleep hours and falling asleep again after a short period (10-60 minutes).
Using a relatively quiet alarm clock can easily make you aware without fully waking you up.
If you are resetting the clock yourself in your sleep, perhaps you could keep it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed when turning it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to get up to urinate.
A person's peace of mind is directly and inversely related to the anxieties of their body and soul.
The less the worry, the more positive the presence of life force. Every person has the ability to find ultimate peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightened knowledge. The only things standing in the way of this goal are our own anxieties and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of compassion and various techniques of Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the expression of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (consciousness energy) is awakened through yoga practice, breathing exercises, mantra recitation, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the realization of divine energy, the channels of energy emission are purified, the chakras are activated, and consciousness is generated.
During World War II, Germany, the main enemy, played a key role in the cooperation between the Soviet Union and America. With the end of the war, internal conflicts over systems, processes, and cultures led to disputes between the countries.
Within two years of the war ending, old allies had become adversaries, and the Cold War had begun.
Later, it lasted for 40 years, and afterwards, the real fighting began with mercenary armies from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans were abruptly cancelled when 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, occupied areas of eastern Poland and entered Belarus and Ukraine, opening a war front. The Riga Treaty was a Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact. The Soviet army also violated other bilateral and multilateral peace treaties in a similar manner.
Using ships is the easiest way to transport a large number of people and a large quantity of goods by sea.
Traditionally, the navy's job was to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time your enemy faces interference with their ability to move their people and goods.
One notable recent example of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, where Americans were trying to get manpower and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allied forces had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain as well, like the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for the easy acquisition of milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Typically, domesticated goats grazed within specific herds in hills or other pastures. Children or adolescents, whom we know as shepherds, were usually appointed to take care of them. These animal husbandry practices are still prevalent today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although railway tracks are merely a collection of parallel wooden planks, they help horses pulling carts gain more speed and carry heavier loads compared to slightly uneven roads.
The crosses were introduced fairly early on to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a strip of iron on top of them.
It had become a common practice, but the iron was stuck on the wooden wheels of the freight train.
Finally, iron wheels began to replace wooden wheels. The first fully iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking twenty lakh years ago, from when the Homo erectus species could stand completely upright on two legs.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not naturally have the habit of walking upright.
Bipedalism was a distinctive feature found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is hypothesized that Sahelanthropus began walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can interact with the environment in a more friendly way, we can get involved with environmental movements, and we can even work as environmental activists, so that future suffering is reduced to some extent.
This is much like treating the symptoms. However, if we don't want just temporary solutions, then we need to find the root of the problem and neutralize it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humankind, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of humanity.
After being adopted by the legislature on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the legislature, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
That night, 150 to 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
On July 8th, John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 known surviving Dunlop Broadsides are the oldest known copies of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists still believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and continues to live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
However, there are many aspects among birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly, clawed feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like T-Rexes.
In fact, all computers used today rely on the manipulation of information in the coded form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits when used as a computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like nausea are very common and not immediately diagnostic.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of open containers of medication or household toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in a strict sense to identify insects belonging to this group.
This word is derived from the old familiar term for bed-bugs, which are highly adapted to infesting humans as parasitic organisms.
Both parasitic mites and bed bugs are observed to be adapted to live in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is considered a leading neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged individuals.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to experience migraines.
A couple may decide that the idea of raising a child is not within the capacity of them or their child.
The couple can make an adoption plan for their child.
During adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights as parents so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works through the scientific method. This guides the direction of scientific research.
Not only this, but experimentation is a method used to reject one or more potential hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, as well as guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
By denying knowledge about Greece, the West began to detach itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms of physiology and behavior are present in endogenous cycles and their production often depends on biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks possess inherent, long-lasting oscillators that can run for durations akin to free-running cycles, even without external forces.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus in one, and the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur in the other.
Genetic alterations can have various effects, but the nature of these effects depends on the type of gene alteration, the severity of damage to the genetic material, and whether the damaged cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations that occur in germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring; mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts individuals interested in natural areas for the purpose of enjoying natural scenery, including plants, animals, and wildlife.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks to study ecosystem-related information.
For example, in Borneo there are opportunities to see orangutans, take pictures, and learn about them.
Every morning, workers leave the small towns by car to go to their workplaces, passing those whose homes are others' workplaces along the way.
Everyone in this dynamic shuttle transportation system is somehow connected to and supporting a transportation system based on individual cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its stable state, which was suitable for human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone lives in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear complaints like this about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why does the transportation system raise these kinds of complaints, why does it fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow refers to the study of the movement and interactions between drivers and their vehicles within a section of road.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to predict traffic patterns because drivers' behavior can never be understood with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate within a specific, consistent range, and as a result, the transportation system can also be represented mathematically within a reasonably logical scope.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationship between three key characteristics has been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and managing road and transportation facilities.
Insects were the first creatures to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings against their rear body.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
While some people respected his opinion, the majority disagreed with the idea that the Sun (and even other stars) in the solar system revolved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, as we can't perceive the Earth rotating, can we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, and in some places it is six miles wide.
Of the total amount of river water that flows into the oceans of this planet, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one could surpass the size of the Giza pyramids and the technological excellence of their construction.
The new generation was amazed to see the monuments of the ancient Egyptians, which were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legal activities and official communications.
For those who work in the state, Italian is the everyday language, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Vatican City's citizens are all Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, humans have been familiar with various basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because these are found in nature in the form of ores, and these minerals were equivalent to the primary components of ancient tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a combination of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It's like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although according to his theory, they transform into new substances to form what we are seeing.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Substances like calcium and potassium are considered metals. However, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in this universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called molecules.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pen became a close friend of humans.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to less importance and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, never needing a sharpener.
One can only wonder what keyboards will be like when something new comes along.
A fusion bomb works on the principle of the energy required to bind the nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy freight train uphill. The nuclei are splitting and then releasing some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they decay spontaneously or with a slight disturbance.
The surface of the moon is made of dust and rock. The outer surface of the moon is called the crust.
This crust is 70 km thick in the front and 100 km thick in the back.
It is thin in Maria and thick in highlands.
Because the crust is thin, there may be many more maria closer to the crust. It is very easy for lava to rise to its surface.
The goal of content theories is to identify what things people tick off or what things appeal to them.
According to these theories, people have specific needs and/or desires that develop within them as they mature.
These theories aim to understand what motivates specific people to do the things they do, and what aspects of their environment will motivate them to do, or not do, certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can arise as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One of these behaviors involves trying to remain "one of the boys (or girls)."
Such managers face obstacles in unpopular decisions, disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, task allocation, and ensuring accountability.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone incredibly transforms into a person who feels they must change everything being done in the group and make it their own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often becomes the reason for rifts between the leader and the rest of the party.
Virtual teams were able to maintain their quality compared to traditional teams, but subtle differences existed there as well.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact to their immediate real-world branches.
They often have more autonomy than members of traditional teams because their teams may meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of extraordinary teams.
"An invisible team" is a management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to create a learning institution? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available functional resources are utilized across various departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fostered.
As a result, when all the employees of an organization work together to overcome obstacles, new innovative processes are created that will meet the needs of the customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, the person in charge of its management must create an innovative culture and, along with that, facilitate knowledge sharing and organizational learning with each other.
Angel (2006) explains the Consistent Approach as a method being used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurological data provides concrete evidence for theoretical perspectives in the pursuit of knowledge. This narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain structure and behavior supports scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and explore the unseen structures and processes of our brains.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material for creating simulation models, which helps us understand the processes of the mind.
Although AI has strong roots in science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in a machine.
AI research involves creating machines that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer needs and queries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These types of things have evolved into distinct disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Currently, AI systems are frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and they are also built into most home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher will prefer to take the students to places where there is no opportunity for bus travel.
In every otherworldly realm, technology provides its solutions. Students can view museum exhibits, visit aquariums, or appreciate fine art from the comfort of their classrooms.
In effect, sharing travel details is a great way to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol; the website is redesigned every year, but the old version is kept in a scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often make grammatical and spelling errors when they start blogging, these errors are usually corrected due to the presence of readers.
Because students are the most critical audience, the blog writer has focused on improving their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "compels students to be more knowledgeable about the world around them." It influences students to be more clever and inquisitive in order to satisfy the interests of the audience (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a good way to learn to work collaboratively outside of traditional schooling and to provide inspiration.
The appropriate use of blogs can make students more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials in the context of others' writing, students can explain their positions and simultaneously outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, showcasing Canada's past and present through its diverse art exhibitions and museums.
Far beyond Niagara Falls to the south and Muskoka to the north lies a focal point of unexpressed natural beauty.
These things and more showcase Ontario as quintessentially Canadian to outsiders.
Further north, the vast regions are sparsely populated, and nearby, almost uninhabited wildernesses exist.
A population comparison that will surprise many: the number of African Americans residing in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African archipelagoes are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most small island groups are independent states, or associated with France, and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
Even the Arabs brought Islam, and it was widely adopted in Comoros and Mayotte.
The arrival of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in India via the Cape Route marked the beginning of European influence and colonialism in the 15th century.
The northern region is bordered by the Sahel, and the southern and western regions are bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: All female travelers, regardless of their actual marital status, should state that they are married.
It also helps in wearing rings (not just to look expensive).
Women should understand that what they consider harassment may occur due to cultural differences, and being followed or having one's hand held, etc., are not uncommon.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether there are cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was strategically used as a port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it after the 1755 earthquake to abandon it, and rebuilt it as Casa Branca.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and renamed it Dar al-Bayda, and the Spanish merchants who established a trading base there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is the least interesting place in all of Morocco for shopping.
Traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and much more are readily available around the old Medina, but they are all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist-heavy city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which destroyed most of the city's roads, especially the city center.
Although Goma is generally safe, any excursions outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing war situation in the North Kivu province.
Besides being the base for ascending the Nyiragongo volcano, this city was also the base for affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
To get to Goma, you can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). A typical (local) price for a short trip is ~500 Congolese Francs.
"Timbuktu," combined with its relative inaccessibility, has been used as a figure of speech for exotic, far-off places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor country, although due to its popularity, it is an attractive tourist destination and also has an airport.
Due to the risks associated with desert sand, it was added to the list of world's endangered heritage sites in 1990.
One of the major challenges in doing this PBS African world special for Henry Louis Gates was the time.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because the environment here is more influenced by Arabia than Africa.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 distinct ecological zones, each a habitat for different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like every national park in South Africa, the park has daily conservation and entrance fees.
Someone can also buy a Wild Card, which allows entry into specific parks in South Africa or any national park.
The region of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and this place is considered a major destination for many tourists.
Hong Kong's skyline buildings create reflections in Victoria Harbour's water, resembling sparkling bar charts.
For the best views of Hong Kong, head out of the delta and towards the Kowloon Waterfront opposite.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely located on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This place was embraced by the colonizers as their own, and so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest, with its hinterland stretching up to 80 km (50 miles) along the coastlines of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove wetlands - they also contain the last remnants of endangered forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The area of the Sundarbans is 3,850 square kilometers. One-third of this area is wetland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and the region now has an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) to all destinations during the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advised to buy tickets well in advance as inter-district buses are often full.
Japanese small coaster buses run in most districts, which are comfortable and strongly built.
Shared taxis offer a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (NU 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. This bridge spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long, and it has two roads that are 3.50 meters wide.
The specified minimum vertical clearance of the bridge is 15 meters. Although construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group in eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for sustenance.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, born from the encounter between the local indigenous groups and the Spanish conquerors, was known as the "Giant Province of the Indies."
The Spanish initiated a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain its significant indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is well-known for being one of the best polo teams in the world and for having excellent players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas polo grounds.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and information on where to purchase polo match tickets, contact the Argentina de Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to 1 British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on Stanley Island, located across from the FIC West Store.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also widely accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on remote islands, although British and US currency may be taken; contact the owners in advance to find out the exact method of payment.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency is nearly impossible outside of the islands, so change your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it experiences drought when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a tropical zone; during the summer months, the temperature usually exceeds +30°C.
Winter can be strangely cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
Here, there isn't any particularly "rainy" or "dry" season: it rains roughly the same amount throughout the year.
Although all the animals in the park are used to seeing people, they are still wild animals at heart, and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how calm they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all other large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year due to failure to maintain proper distance. These animals are usually large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so let them be in their own space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was established in 1850, and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval blockade in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except for one British cruise ship sank. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Maoist movement, Paramount Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed as a result of a peaceful gathering in the city.
Auckland has many beaches due to the separation of its two harbors. Three are the most popular.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These have mostly sandy beaches with safe swimming and plenty of Pohutukawa tree shade.
Waitemata Harbour, encompassing the suburbs of St Heliers and Mission Bay in central Auckland, is overlooked by Tamaki Drive.
These are occasionally densely packed, family-friendly beaches with a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The local staple beer is 'Number One'; it's not a compound beer, but it's enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is "Manta".
There will be plenty of French wine, but the New Zealand and Australian wines will sell better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the 'flat white' coffee is something foreign. A short black 'espresso', cappuccino with a good amount of cream (not foamed), and tea served without milk are more common.
The hot chocolate is of similar quality to Belgian chocolate. Fruit juice is usually expensive, but it tastes great.
The coral reefs are visited by many throughout the year, and injuries are very rare due to these reasons.
Still, seek advice from the authorities, follow all the signals, and pay close attention to safety precautions.
Box jellyfish are found north of the town of '1770' in Queensland, Australia, from April to mid-October. However, these box jellyfish are occasionally seen outside of this period as well.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their primary habitat is the estuaries and river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing that they will have a place to sleep after arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it's also possible to book other types of accommodations like camping grounds through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages, or transportation arrangements.
They can hold the reservation for you if you need time to gather other documents for your destination (such as a visa) or to consider the proposal.
For any corrections or requests, one should speak with the travel agent first before contacting the hotel directly.
At some festivals, the huge number of people attending musical events decide to camp on site, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to join this initiative, you need to reach a music-focused camping site quickly.
Please remember that even after the main stage music ends, there might be after-parties where music plays late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the location of your cabin, as the cabins most exposed during icebreaking can be subject to terrible noise.
Time in St. Petersburg is included in the cruise. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos generally make every effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are typically absent, and finding an exit can be relatively difficult.
They usually arrange special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and on the premises.
Alcohol is available as a beverage in some places. However, intoxication diminishes discretion, and all skilled gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving through high-altitude areas or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is less friction, and you cannot drive as if you are on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time that you could become stranded.
Visibility may be limited due to falling or blowing snow, or by frost accumulating on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in quite a few countries, and traffic flows continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction, a major draw for many visitors.
The widespread use of the word "safari" means a land journey to see the captivating African wildlife, especially the savanna wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and having specific equipment can help you see them better.
Lions, tigers, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you're better off seeing them through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") typically involves hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation in 2020 before the cancellation, you were in a very awkward situation.
Cancellation policies are subject to change, but coronavirus-based cancellation policies accepted until the end of March are not extended to July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled to take place.
Ticket prices for most events are expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with general admission tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards, even when no one is present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful, don't let the iron get too hot (this can cause shrinkage or, in some cases, burning).
There are various methods of water purification. Alternative approaches, beyond the specific ones, are more effective.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other areas, it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you're concerned, you should buy sealed water bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may find insecticides that they haven't usually seen in their own area.
Insects spoil food, create nuisances, and in worse cases, cause allergies, spread poison, and infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that use force to injure or kill people, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without paying tax and excise duty in certain designated locations.
Travelers can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, by traveling to countries with higher taxes.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont presents one of the most challenging driving conditions due to frequent traverses through dense, isolated woodlands along the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, use your head: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than the preceding and following sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to these limits is crucial.
Strangely, though, the mobile phone service is much stronger here compared to various sections of other routes, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are mostly as rich and diverse as their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples cooked in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain nuts, hazelnuts, and other nut ingredients. Popular cakes often pair well with a cup of coffee.
If you want some small but high-quality pastries, try some called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
A curry can be "dry" or "gravy-like" depending on the amount of liquid.
In North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; whereas in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
The extensive list of Indonesian cuisine includes various local dishes from across the country's 17,000 islands.
However, if used without further qualification, the term primarily refers to the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now readily available throughout the archipelago, consisting of a collection of seasonal dishes. The main attraction of Javanese cuisine is cooking with a combination of peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
A stirrup is a support for the rider's foot that exists on both sides of the rider's saddle.
They provide more balance to the riders, but safety concerns remain due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting trapped in them.
If a horse throws its rider but a foot remains stuck in the stirrup, the horse may bolt, dragging them along. To mitigate this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots that have a heel and a smooth, almost narrow, sole.

In the right conditions, you can cover slightly more distance than walking - but you won't get the same speed as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Despite being a relatively small continent, Europe is home to a number of distinct countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to different countries would require going through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you are in this region, you can usually cross the country's border without going through these passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you don't need to apply for separate visas for each member country of the Schengen area, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.

When the scenes are projected onto the surface, the pyramids light up.
As of 2020, sixteen countries have active claims, with the most substantive basis among various nations claiming the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819.
The archipelago is located approximately 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest, along with the Villa Las Estrellas settlement.
The floating calderas of active and dormant volcanoes in the Deception region, including Livingston Island, have created picturesque natural harbors.
To the south of the peninsula, the Ellsworth Land area is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountain ranges merge into a plateau, then form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which bisect the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains Antarctica's highest mountain range, the Vinson Massif, which reaches its peak at Vinson Mountain at a height of 4892 meters.
In remote areas where cell phone coverage is unavailable, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are generally not a substitute for mobile phones, because you need to be in an open space with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
