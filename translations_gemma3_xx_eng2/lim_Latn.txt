USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the American Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to maintain a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC’s explanation that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, would be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than decertification.

This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers—a theory that is already widespread—but also gives details that fossils generally cannot reveal, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Bird watchers say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The research also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaurs lacked a well-developed rachis – the central support structure of feathers – but possessed other feather characteristics like barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development in relation to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used during flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is from a young dinosaur, the example showed adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the start of a young dinosaur, the specimen showed the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
In a car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, two police officers were killed and more than twenty other people were injured.

They discovered that the sun worked according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system proved to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The color and winding are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversals.

The Iraq Study Group presented its report yesterday at 12:00 GMT.
It warns that no one can guarantee that any action plan at this moment in Iraq will counter sectarian warfare, the increase of violence, or a slide towards chaos.
The report begins with a plea for an open debate and for a consensus to emerge in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East.
The report is very critical of almost every aspect of the current policy of the executive branch for Iraq and urges an immediate change of course.
The first of the 78 recommendations is that before the end of this year, new diplomatic initiatives must be taken to protect the borders of Iraq against hostile interference and to restore diplomatic relations with neighboring countries.
Current senator and Argentine First Lady Christina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her presidential candidacy last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for the presidency at the Argentine Theatre, the same location as when she began her campaign for the senate in 2005 as a member of the Buenos Aires provincial delegation.
The debate was sparked by squabbling over funding for aid and reconstruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina; which, through some fiscally conservative voices, had received the nickname “Bush’s New Orleans Deal”.
The liberal criticism of the pressure for reconstruction has focused on the awarding of construction contracts to so-called insiders from Washington.

Commons administrator Adam Cuerden expressed his frustration over the deletion when he spoke with Wikinews last month.
He [Wales] actually wanted to deceive us from the beginning. First, by acting as if it was for legal reasons. Second, by simply pretending to listen to us, even going so far as to agree to the removal of the images by tying them up.
The frustration within the community led to the current effort to develop a policy regarding sexual material for the site where millions of copyright-free media are hosted.
The completed work was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius star system.
The effect and the team are now looking for what could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the star system and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational pull on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory posits that most dark matter is situated in a kind of halo around a star system and consists of many small pieces.

“Its thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly consistent temperature, but it does align with the idea that it would be a deep pocket in the ground,” said Glenn Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has always been a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth alone, mark a pre-printed slip of paper with their chosen candidate indicated on it, and put it in an envelope.
Having confirmed the identity of the emperor, the emperor drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The codification of procedures for the French cheese law is relatively strict.
Since 1988, voting booths must be transparent, so that scrutineers and observers can see that no envelopes are already inside at the start of the election and that no envelopes are added except for those from properly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates may appoint representatives to witness each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Now, after the event on Tuesday, Carpanedo shared first place in two individual races on the championship stage.
Her first event was the slalom, where she did not finish in her first run. 36 of the 116 participants had the same result in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the group of skiers with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
This year, the women skiers couldn't manage to finish the steep section of the men's course, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify for the race there.
The Madhya Pradesh police returned the stolen laptop and a mobile phone.
Replacing inspector-general DK Arya saw: “we have arrested five people who crashed into the Swiss barrier and recovered their mobile phone and laptop”.
The suspects are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Ramrpo Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki saw that the suspect entered the courtroom with a covered face.
Luckily, all three men were at home when the car crashed onto the roof, so no one was injured.
Unfortunately, Evels, the driver, was seriously injured on his head.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh since then, and Sheriff Court is accusing him of the murder of his son.
She is in jail awaiting arraignment and the trial, but any eyewitness testimony can be tainted because her image has been widely published in the newspaper.
In other places in the UK this is common, but Scottish justice works differently and courts consider the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes: “Journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects.”
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has informed journalists that no further comment will be made in any event until the indictment.
The document will, according to appearances, refer to the border arrangement that Palestine wants to base on the borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
Other topics that are reportedly on the table include the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has maintained a military presence in the valley for ten years until an agreement was signed, while the PA stipulated that such a presence should only be left after five years.
The shooting grounds in the accompanying trial with pest control had to be precisely checked by rangers, because the trial was monitored and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a collaborative effort between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s pest control program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters who were selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is the fifth CEP from Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the dismissal of the current CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelly’s reaction to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The recent violent protests were caused by the postponement of elections, some of which had been planned since 2011.
Around 60 cases have been reported of iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that there had been 27 incidents related to the machine.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them about 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called “not serious.”
The Ministry responded by calling Apple’s postponement of the bulletin “regrettable”.
The earthquake was at 7:19 local time (Friday, 9:19 pm GMT) in Mariana.
The crisis managers of the Northern Marianas have stated that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center saw that there was no indication of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer recently kidnapped a couple of tourists from Hong Kong in their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16.
Fortunately, the stranded tourists have been rescued, and it is said that they really owe their lives to it.
These hostages, including children and adults, have been joyfully released, just like the Filipino photographer.
The photographer later took the place of an elderly woman, because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working in Auckland’s National Women’s Hospital in 1959.
While he worked in the hospital, Liggins began to research joyful births in his free time.
Their research showed that the hormone’s rope would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Sunday recovered two ‘black-box’ flight recorders.
Colleague butchers also brought gifts to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night between two moons. Very unique, just like her. Strong woman.”
Dustin “Golddust” Runnels noticed that “Luna wasn’t as crazy as he thought… Maybe even with… her heel and he will miss her… hopefully she is in a better place.”
From a survey of 1400 respondents who were questioned before the 2010 federal election, the number of opponents to the Australian republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim-prime minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the findings of the poll, 29 percent of those questioned believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer was scheduled to compete in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his condition was questionable.
He is unable to take the medicine needed to overcome the pain, because he has been banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Beginning in February, several people verified the discovery with the help of various hardware and software and announced it this Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of the delivery of water to Earth, together with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was shaped, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as “political hearsay and foolishness”.
It is thought that he will become president in 2016.
NexGen is a system whereby the FAA claims it would enable aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel annually, while reducing CO2 emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology in contrast to the older ground radar-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with accurate information.
Therefore, no extra transport will be deployed and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the ground.
Because of a lack of sufficient transport, there is a possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although it was assumed that this process would take much longer due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed in all sorts of ways. It can be rolled into small shapes.
The wood is drawn into thin wires, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
Gold leaf was made very thin and applied to other metals. It could be made so thin that it was often used to embellish hand-painted images in books that are called “illuminated manuscripts”.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Moss changes colour depending on whether the chemical substance is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons because the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Carefully mix the two remaining poems together and then knead them with clean, wet knuckles into a ball.
The skin on your knuckles will react with the lowest layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjodara had in almost every house a flushing toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewage systems have been found.
Even in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, toilets existed. In Roman civilization, toilets were often part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in a somewhat communal setting.
If someone you love is thousands of kilometers away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our vision.
You need a considerable rocket, more than 100 feet high, to place a satellite or telescope into space.
The council has changed the area in unbelievable ways. The greatest thing the council has done for us is to provide much more comfortable and faster transport.
It used to be that we used the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Under them are medium-sized cats who eat medium-sized prey, alternating from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that every cat has which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats; they live in large groups called prides.
A colony consists of one to three related adult males, together with preferably thirty or more females and pups.
The fruit flies are usually related to one another and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lynx behave just like domestic cats (but not like other big cats) in their behaviour, and are also very sensitive about their territory.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the hellish roar of the lion, but more like a sigh of swirling, whispered words.
Ocelots are generally small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Vultures think ocelots follow another animal and find it to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and are also very stealthy. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
A small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population where they originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they don’t commonly return) will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different sources and other competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations to be a strong competitor as they previously needed to be.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still have the same needs for adjustment now as they did before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they gradually start to resemble the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is not speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people breathe out (that is to say, exhale).
Plants make their food from sunlight through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make use of plants for food and make clay figures from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaurus was the most important predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
He had long been known to be obsessed with more than 70 extremely sharp knives, including an extra set hidden in his coat, which signified that there was no escaping what he intended to do to all his bones.
It wasn’t certainly a mosasaur, but it could have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it might even have been a cannibal.
That fellow also experienced everything that came with the weather, even a huge, gigantic dinosaur like the T. rex wouldn't have stood a chance against him.
Today, most of their food would be considered exotic or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and another type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that meanwhile the poor people and the women ate while they sat on stools, the rich people held banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating.
Originally, Roman meals contained no vegetables that later centuries brought to Europe from America or Asia.
They didn't have, for example, corn, tobacco, potatoes, cocoa, and not even a single Roman had ever tasted porridge.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the house of god.
He offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests sought to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
The temple had an open courtyard and subsequently an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called Ziggurats, were built to form part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
The greatest part of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Earlier, it was hot in the head, shops were open and people were looking into the street. Stone was used for building houses.
They had to carry enormous timbers into the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely scarce.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite their recent discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there then.
Today, every land was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between them, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think that the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map written on it.
That’s not true. Even though there is something on the back of the document, it’s not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776”. The text was reproduced upside down in the document.
Today, no one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
It is therefore likely that the notation was simply a label added.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not yet free.
The town was ruled by the “Vichy” French. These were French who in 1940 had concluded peace with the Germans and worked with invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces entered Southern France, the invasion being called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks’ time, the Americans and the Free French troops had liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
A bee colony is a unique culture that is shared by a significantly large group of individuals who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word 'beschaaving' comes from the Latin 'civilis', which means civic, and 'civitas', which means city or town hall, and that reflects in one way or another also the scope of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A culture of contemplation implies the passing on of knowledge across more generations, a continuing cultural footprint, and an honorable dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognised as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government – with Congress as a single component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its actions.
It had no authority to levy tax laws and tariffs between states.
The article required unanimous approval from all states before it could be amended, and states named the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, like the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which is why Japan is the 7th largest island country in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often seen geographically as an “archipelago”.
They already began in the 15th year, because European sailors who passed by noted the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated a transformation in the production practices of indigenous grains and employed Chinese laborers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) took control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
The most important buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what it originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
The most used format for still images in the world is, for example, 35 mm, the dominant film format at the end of the analogue film era.
The wort is still produced, but what is even more important is that the aspect ratio has been taken over by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would therefore be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, an APS family of formats) have this aspect ratio or approximate it.
The much-abused and often ridiculous rule of thumb is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while still maintaining a certain measure of order.
They state that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
In this time of European history, the Catholic Church, which was extensive and powerful, came under fire.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
That overwhelming power affected everyone, from king to commoner.
One of the most important teachings of the church is that having a lot of money should be used to care for the less fortunate and the poor, and that the church’s wealth should be for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been established in Reum for more than a thousand years and, due to the concentration of power and money, many people wondered if they really meant what they said.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective and cut off vital military and civilian supply routes, while this blockade was in violation of generally accepted international law as codified by various international treaties.
Great Britain has international waters deployed to prevent ships from entering large parts of the ocean, whereby even neutral ships are at risk.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the nineteen twenties, the prevailing trend among most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
Having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique system to show different time periods; each phase of China or each family that was in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between those two dynasties was a period of unstable, fragmented provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce warfare took place there between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying while battling to sit on the highest throne in the great palace in Xi’an.
These are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Now that the revolution had firmly taken hold for all male candidates, the most ambitious and successful men could succeed.
The same zeal for the army, because instead of army ranks being based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that went beyond everyday life. He visited a cave that became known as “Hira” on the mountain of “Noor” (low) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, which is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s completely not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it’s total isolation.
All that can be seen is the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. From the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century before Christ, the Great Pyramid is one of the many great miraculous structures that were built to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or “Giza Necropolis” in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the women and family members of Khufu.
The “upward bow” mark looks sad, it’s a V, and the “downward bow mark” is a staple or a spring from which the underside is missing.
Forehand means to start completely with the tip and to push the bow down, and backhand means to start completely with the heel of the hand (that’s where your hand holds the bow) and to pull on the bow.
An upward bow generally produces a softer sound, while a downward bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the printed inflection signs are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified king Louis XVI, queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were driven back from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
A little boy travelled back to Paris, surrounded by many people who shouted and threatened the king and the queen.
The majority of the people forced the king and the queen to set the route of their carriage wide open.
At a given moment, a member of the assembly suddenly had the idea of imitating the head of a royal guard who had been posted at Versailles for the terrified queen.
The costs of the war of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds that were traded via the banking houses of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits that arise from the long-lasting exploitation of the Filipino people would form the base profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The period in which these events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, the period in European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by agreement ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a name that in practice encompasses many different ideas, ranging from technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict belief that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself charts a course beyond the influence of culture on politics, and that the effects of technology on society are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
You could easily say that a car always leads to more trouble.
Well, traveling through the country is not economically viable for a few cars, therefore young people are finding new ways to make owning a car cheaper.
Many autumns also cause more accidents on the road, and that leads to the development of new techniques in clinics for repairing broken bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture arose that were connected to that geography, and these were, in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was regarded as the capital of the heart of feudal Europe.
It became known as a luxurious settlement around 400 AD, and it flourished until approximately 1100 AD.
People looked at him less in the twelfth century, especially because the crusaders returned with gifts of spices and herbs, which were valued higher than what they grew on the markets in Byzantium.
In that time, the name of the capital of the fashion of Constantinople was transferred to Paris.
The Gothic style reached a high point in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Around the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was the beginning of using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple, often organic system in which use is made of stored seed originating from the eco-region, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically speaking, most farmers were largely self-sufficient in agriculture, and this is still largely the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together who are often drawn by seemingly trivial criteria and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that can define a subculture linguistically, aesthetically, religiously, politically, sexually, geographically, or through a combination of factors are distinctive.
Membership in a subculture is often demonstrated by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most used methods to illustrate the balance of socialization is to draw from the unfortunately rare cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Some children are called unwanted or wild. Some children were locked up by people (often their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe mental or physical disability.
Children who become lost or run away may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others would see through their great wastefulness; some would live alone in the world.
If the bewildered child is greatly disturbed by non-human animals, does it exhibit behaviour (within physical limits) that closely resembles that of the specific caregiving animal, such as fear of or indifference towards people?
Learning project-based everywhere is more enjoyable and interesting, you’re taking a step further.
Guidelines aren't a teaching method, but rather a tool that offers support to people undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Settings can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold, but that also applies to the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual setups are internalized in the software and are intended to question, stimulate, and explain procedures that might be too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are being placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even abandonment.
Every child deserves to grow up in an environment that is not harmful, caring and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our youth care system is intended to offer safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Aftercare is expected to provide for all necessities that were lacking in the home they previously came from.
The internet combines forms of mass communication and also communication between people.
The precise characteristics of the Internet provide extra dimensions when it comes to the "uses and gratifications" approach.
Zoe identified "leisure" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal rapport and “enduring relationships” were also seen by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivations, as they investigated people’s reactions to the publicity of websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks noted in his paper, The President’s Speech, how people who are unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He thinks that certain cognitive abilities involved in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Recent research has shown that there are two poles of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations introduce a lot of genetic variation, but selection removes this from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two poles with each generation.
On the savanna, it is for a primate with a diet like that of humans difficult to obtain enough amino acids from available plant species.
Smoking is called the voluntary descent into hell with the following consequences: growth depression, undernourishment and ultimately death.
The most digestible protein sources would be those available in leafy greens and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
Eating insects (crickets, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides high-quality proteins containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors happened to have solved their “protein problem” in roughly the same way chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the brief, deliberate awakening during your usual sleep period, followed by falling back asleep within a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm to gently bring you to consciousness so you can fully wake up.
If you notice that you set the clock in your bedroom again, it can be placed on the other side of your room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms included drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, thereby forcing someone to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the amount of tension in body and mind.
The more you cherish the moment, the more positive the present life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute freedom and contentment.
Everyone can achieve fulfillment. The one thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is awakened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries falling apart.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would truly be fought out, through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize near the Romanian border.
This plan was almost immediately overtaken by events when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created a situation after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of navies was traditionally to ensure that your land retains the ability to transport its people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy's capacity to move its people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily with U-boats, was busy trying to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, then Germany would likely have also conquered Britain, just as the other parts of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
At first, culture and tribe began to have dealings for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in a shed that grazed over the hills or other areas. They were accompanied by a shepherd who were often children or young people, such as the well-known shepherds. This method of shepherding is still used today.
Railways were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Today, this road consisted only of parallel plank wood, but a horse could pull a heavier load and faster on it than on the gravel road of that time.
Crossbars were initially introduced to keep the track in place. Over time, it became clear that the track would be more efficient if the sleepers were covered with iron.
This became customary, but the iron caused a lot more wear on the wooden frame of the wagon.
Eventually, the wooden rails were replaced by iron ones. In 1767 the completely iron rail became known.
The first known human transport was walking. Humans began to walk upright with the arrival of Homo Erectus (which literally means "man upright"), two million years ago.
Her ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may already have been able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We could live more friendly with the environment. We could join the nature association and we could go protest to reduce pollution in the future.
This could, in many cases, only be seen as symptom management. But if we don’t want a temporary solution, then we would investigate and solve the problems thoroughly.
It is clear enough that the world has changed a lot due to the technological and scientific progress of humankind. Problems have grown larger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of some people.
Having been accepted by the congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft by the congress’s president, John Hancock, and secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few streets over to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
The entire batch, numbering between 150 and 200 copies, made at the time, is now known as “Dunlap broadsides”.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the cupola of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was addressed to George Washington on July 6th. He read it aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe nowadays that a group of dinosaurs still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people think they aren't dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
Many things about birds make me think of dinosaurs.
They look new with spurs and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T. rex.
Practically all computers are currently based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have two values: 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Poisoning isn’t always immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are so common that a definitive diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of poisoning would be the absence of an open medicine bottle or poisonous household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
The common name is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This name comes from the increasing awareness of bed bugs, which are insects that are well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Most and best guests stay long with their neighbours, and their adapted life is gladly in the next or house of their host.
Across the entire United States, approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are known, making it one of the largest neurological diseases among young and older adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. This consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple might decide that it's better for them and for the child if they don't raise children.
These people might choose to give their child up for adoption.
Both parties involved in the biological dispute have the right to ensure that another party doesn't cause them trouble.
The core of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method underlies most scientific research.
Not only do we need alone, but the design of experiments is also used to test hypotheses. Furthermore, questions are asked and observations are made to guide science.
The naturalist and philosopher focused on classical texts and particularly on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific and psychological insights were accepted.
When knowledge of the Greek language was lost, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific origins.
Many observed rhythms in psychology and behaviour often depend on endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Recurring rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that, in all organisms, even without external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important to show that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to place their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments to see whether the DNA of the phage had been labeled with radioactive phosphorus or the protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many effects depending on how important the piece of DNA is, the type of mutation, and whether they are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline can be passed on to children, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or lead to cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wild animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Visiting orangutan sanctuaries, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, many people leave the village in cars to go to work, and are passed by others who are on their way from where they just left.
Everyone in this dynamic transport system is connected to, and relies on, their own cars in one way or another.
Science now shows that this carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone should participate in society and use public transport (OV). Almost everyone can travel by public transport.
In developed countries, you hardly ever hear about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do these transport systems fail so often; why do they fall over every day again? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers do behave with a certain predictability; therefore, traffic flow can reasonably consistently be represented with mathematical models.
To ensure traffic flow, relationships between three magnitudes must be established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This association assists with the planning, design and operation of the road network.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. Their ability to fly has helped them to avoid enemies and to find food and partners more easily.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings backwards over their bodies.
This is about their ability to disappear in small places to escape predators.
Today, the few insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Centuries ago, a man named Aristarchus saw that the planets revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people thought the opposite: that the sun revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems logical, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, or does it sometimes?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. More water flows through it than eight times the amount that flows through the largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes as wide as 6 km.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). Water flows into it from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and their technical ingenuity.
Inhabitants of the new kingdom in ancient Egypt admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were already thousands of years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian for its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language spoken by most workers in the state, although Latin is still used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Gold has been known since antiquity due to the existence of simple chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because these can be discovered in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, realized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was actually like how the four states of aggregation (respectively) are: solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also thought about how they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply defined as a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
The kidneys also contain trace amounts of non-metals like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so unbelievably small that billions could fit at the end of this sentence.
So, the teapot was a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with newer methods to record well-thought-out words, the pencil has fallen to an ever-lower status.
He doesn't understand a thing about computer screens, and they never want to come near a sleeper again.
What would happen with the keyboard when something new comes along?
The fission bomb works on the principle that it costs energy to create a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Approximately like a heavy card sliding down a mountain. The splitting of the core then releases some of the energy again.
Sometimes atoms have no fixed cores, which means they easily come loose from a shell with little to no effort.
The moon's surface consists of stone and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the clear side and 100 km thick on the dark side.
It’s darker under the Maria and thicker under the highlands.
Perhaps there was still more maria on the ground because the crust was thinner. It was easier for the lava to come to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates people or appeals to them.
These theories state that some people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized while growing up.
These theories look at how certain people want some things and how their environment ensures they do or don't do those things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg’s Two-Factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two behaviours that can occur when someone in the team takes the lead. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain part of the group.
Leaders have problems making difficult decisions such as: imposing penalties, assessing performance, delegating responsibility and holding people accountable.
On the other hand of the spectrum, I transform into an unrecognizable person who feels they must change everything the team has done to make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often resulted in alienation between leaders and the rest of the team.
Online teams are subject to the same requirements as normal teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Online teams often have a point of contact for the group that stands close to them.
They need more autonomy than conventional teammates because there are different time zones, which are not understood by local management.
The presence of a truly “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The “Invisible team” is the management and each member must report to it. The Unseen team sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to spend so much time on the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? A goal of putting learning and organizing concepts into practice is renewal.
If all available sources are used effectively by all departments of the organization, then creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
Overcoming the cooperation process within the organization and passing an obstacle can lead to new innovation to meet the customer’s needs.
Before an organization can renew itself, its leadership must create a culture of sharing knowledge and organizational development.
Angel (2006) states that the Continuum approach is a method that can be used to help organizations perform better.
Neurobiological data has provided much evidence for a new theoretical approach in the study of cognition. As a result, the field of research has become much smaller and more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumours can influence behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to study brain structures and processes like never before.
This gives us a lot of information with material to build simulation models that can help us understand processes of the mind.
Although AI evokes a strong feeling of science fiction, it is an important part of computer science. It’s about behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research into AI aims to automate tasks that require knowledge.
Examples include control, planning and rest, the ability to help customers with questions and also to recognise handwriting, voices and faces.
The teams took their separate disciplines and focused on finding solutions for problems in real-life situations.
The AI system is frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but is also applied in various home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are held with each class. It often happens that teachers would like to take the students to places where no buses go.
Technology offers a solution with virtual trips. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
The purpose of an online excursion is a good way to reflect on an excursion and share all experiences with future classes.
For example, each student from Bennet School in North Carolina designs a website about their excursion to the state capital. Each year the website is updated, but old versions are kept online as a reference work.
Blogs can also help with improving the writing skills of students. Although students often start with messy grammar and spelling, the lack of an audience changes that.
To avoid offending the critical audience, the student blogger starts to write better to prevent criticism.
Apparently, blogging forces one to be less naive about the world. The need to be interesting to the public inspired the student to see Toto, 2004, as slum and interesting.
Blogging is a tool that leads to collaboration and motivates students to learn even outside of school hours.
Good use of blogs “can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively participating in internet discussions, students can define their positions in relation to other texts and also articulate their own perspectives on certain issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and has many galleries and museums that show the past and the future of Canada.
We went south to see Niagara Falls and north to experience the natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario what foreigners see as typically Canadian.
Stretched areas further north are sparsely populated and part of it is largely uninhabited.
A comparison that surprises many people is that there are more African Americans in the US than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in some ways it’s even a continent when it comes to its unique nature.
Most of the small islands are independent countries or associate themselves with France. They are known as luxury beach destinations.
The Arabs brought Islam to the land, and that is still very important on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route around the Cape to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women are often said to talk about getting married, regardless of whether that’s actually true.
The boy also helped him carry a ring (but not one that looks expensive).
Women must realize that there are many cultural differences, which can lead to embarrassing experiences, and it is not unusual to be poorly treated or followed, etc.
The mice must clearly show defiance towards the men and mustn’t be afraid to stand their ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t matter!).
The new city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and the Marinids and was known as an important port called Anfa.
The Portuguese renovated it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branco to leave the city again after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish traders gave it the name Casablanca again when they established trading posts there.
In Morocco, Casablanca is certainly not one of the most interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina it’s commonplace to find shops selling traditional games and items like tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs and a whole spectrum of trinkets, but that’s all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city lies far to the east, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, an eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed the city of Goma. The lava covered the largest part of the city, and particularly the city center.
Goma is relatively safe, but as soon as she wants to leave the city, she must see what the situation is with the unrest in North Kivu.
The city is now a starting point for climbs of the Nyiragongo volcano and a number of the cheapest mountain gorilla safaris in Africa.
To explore Goma, one uses a “boda-boda” (motorbike taxi). It normally (locally) costs around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative remoteness, “Timbuktu” has become a metaphor for far-off, exotic lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it also has an airport.
In 1990, the rope bridge was added to the list of world heritage monuments in danger due to desert sand.
The Waor was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates’ PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other towns in the country because it has much more Arabic flair than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, all optimally suited for various types of nature.
It is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African parks (SANParks).
This concerns itself with all African national parks, their daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
The King also likes to be able to buy a Wild Card, which also gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and it is the place many people see as the most important destination.
The parade of buildings that stands on the Hong Kong skyline resembles a glittering bar chart, clearly defined by the presence of the water of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
The majority of Hong Kong’s urban residents are densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonists had secured for themselves, and thus, if you are looking for the colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world, and they stretch 80 km (50 mi) inland into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland of the coast.
The Sundarbans has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not ordinary mangrove swamps, but they contain remnants of the last mighty jungles that once covered the delta of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans encompass an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is covered by water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a safe haven for nature. Estimates say there are now 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses go to the inter-district main station (across the river) all day. But mostly, especially for those going east and departing to Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
If you want to visit the regional bus most of the time, it’s a good idea to buy a few days in advance.
The most popular districts are covered by small Japanese maples that are comfortable and sturdy.
The taxi fare is a quick and comfortable way to travel to places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was largely completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully usable in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs post is expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group who lived in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region was where the base of other tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá existed, who lived from hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called “the great province of India”, was born as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and the original groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to hold onto much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at another time of the year.
For information about tournaments and how to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentinian Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally taken everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and American dollars are often accepted too.
On the outermost islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, however British and American currency can be accepted, check beforehand with the owner to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands money outside the islands, so do that before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is on the equator, it's summer there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30 are very normal.
The winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
Recent years have shown particularly “wet” and “dry” seasons: the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
There were many animals in the park waiting to be fed, but the animals are nevertheless doing well and should not be bothered or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
As submissive as they also look, bison, elk, wapiti, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance. These animals are large, strong, and can be dangerous; therefore, stay away from their enclosure.
Therefore, see to it that you attract no bears, don't wear or cook any scented food, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city lies on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
They had a real maritime impasse in 1889 when seven ships from Prussia, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and Prussian lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town escalated into the murder of chief Tapua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many islands, because Auckland is located between two harbours. The most well-known are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch completely from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are all known for their beautiful beaches with sand where people can safely swim, and they almost all have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The strand of Tamaki Drive lies on Waitemata Harbour, in the shady boat havens of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the midst of Auckland.
Sometimes families stroll there, and there’s a good selection of shops along the road. You can swim there safely.
The most important local beer is ‘Number One’. It’s not a complex beer, it’s a pleasure and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
You can get a lot of French wines here, but the New Zealand and Australian ones might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easily found if you're worried about it.
Australians find the idea of a ‘flat white’ coffee strange. A short black is ‘espresso’, cappuccino is served high with foam (no milk froth), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. The fruit juice prices are excellent.
Many little trips after the reef are made around the year, and blessings are high due to his rarity on the reef.
Always, despite advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to all safety warnings.
Pink-footed geese occurred close to the coast and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside this period.
Sharks look scary, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles live not in the sea, their most important habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Before looking for a place to sleep, the traveller first checks the route so they can sleep somewhere until they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is also possible to book other accommodations, such as campsites, through the travel agencies.
Travel agencies mostly offer packages including lunch, transport to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also put the reservation aside for you if it is urgently needed to think about the deposit or other documents to provide for the destination (visa required).
Any changes or requests must first be submitted through the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
For many festivals, the largest part of the music festival visitors decided to camp on the grounds, and most visitors consider that an indispensable part of the experience.
If you want to be close to what’s happening, you’ll have to be there early to get a camping spot near the music.
Despite the fact that the music on the main stages is already loud, there’s still space at the festival where it will be played late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
We go to the northern East-side first in the winter, check the location of the hut, because ice can cause frightening sounds for them, which are most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers do not need visas (check the conditions).
Casinos relentlessly strive to ensure guests spend as much time and money as possible, clocks are often absent, and exits are difficult to find.
They often have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and on the premises.
Some people have the opportunity to drink for free. But if you’ve had a bit too much, you can’t judge things properly anymore, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at higher altitudes or over mountain passes should be prepared for snow, ice and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, it is very slippery, and you can’t drive as on dry ground.
During snowstorms, a lot of snow can fall in a short time, to the point where you can get stuck in the cold.
Visibility can also be very poor due to falling or blowing snow, or due to condensation or ice on the windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common occurrences in many countries, and traffic usually isn't hindered by it throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to indicate journeys to the countryside in which the magnificent African nature is viewed, particularly on the savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, need to approach cars closely and standard equipment ensures good visibility.
Darling, cheetahs and panthers are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A safari on foot (also called a “bush walk” or going “footing”) consists of a trek of a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also held them in 1964.
If he hadn’t announced the ticket and accommodation for 2020 for the exhibition, and had booked them, he might have been in a difficult situation.
Cancellation conditions vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation conditions have not been valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are held.
It is expected that the price for most components will be between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average price around ¥7,000.
An iron and damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board to lend, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if someone prefers not to wear ironed socks, then you could use a hairdryer, if they have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (otherwise it might shrink, or worse, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some are more effective against certain hazards.
Depending on the pot, it's enough to boil water for a minute, but with another you definitely need a few minutes.
Not all filters are equally effective, and if you are worried, you should consider buying bottled water from a reliable company.
Travellers often encounter things they don't understand.
Contaminated food can spoil, cause irritation, or even trigger an allergic reaction, be poisonous, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm people with physical force are usually not considered insects.
A duty-free shop is an opportunity to buy things without taxes and excise duties in some places.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway. Because of this, it often passes through isolated, wooded areas.
If you’ve been used to riding over sandy paths, then pay attention: you’ll often encounter steep slopes, narrow sections and sharp bends.
Maximum speeds are noticeably lower than on any previous section – averaging around 35-40 (56-64 km/h) – and paying close attention to the signs is even more important than usual.
Surprisingly, the mobile service is much better today than in other parts of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baking is very good, and in Bavaria, rich and varied, comparable to that of their southern neighbour Austria.

Backcountry skiing: this activity is also known as ski touring or ski hiking.
It’s fun to ski, but it’s not the same as alpine skiing, or mountain climbing—the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
