It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils usually don't, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists said that the animals’ feathers are chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provided insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possessed other feather characteristics – “barbs and barbules” – researchers theorized that the rachis was likely a more recent product of evolution than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers proposed that even if it is a tail from a young dinosaur, this example shows it is a feather from an adult dinosaur and not the downy, thin feathers of a chick.
Researchers have suggested that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample displays the plumage of an adult and not that of a hatchling.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.
The governor's office said that nineteen of those injured were police officers.
Police said they suspect the alleged militant group Daesh (ISIL) was responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operates according to basic principles similar to those of other stars: The activity of all stars in the system was found to be powered by their luminosity, by their rotation, and by nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which relates to plasma flow.
The smaller the number of Rosby, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversals.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but the program was written to encourage observational work regarding the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is investigating is what the immense force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way will cause.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth, causing the tides to rise and fall, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have also concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter affects the same ordinary matter.
According to this theory, a large portion of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in a kind of limbo around it, and is made up of a vast number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, a region located in South Africa.
In an interview, she said that the new strain is "deeply disturbing and alarming due to the high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes some patients may have contracted the bacteria in the hospital, and at least two of them are healthcare workers at the hospital.
In a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis appears to remain low: 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected with it at any given time in South Africa.

These are colder than the surrounding ground surfaces in the morning and warmer at night.
“Their warm demeanor isn’t as fixed as the large caves on Earth that often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it’s a good match for them as deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is commonly experienced as a low-tech process: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter will drop the ballot into the ballot box and sign the list of qualified voters.
The French electoral law fairly strictly codifies the processes.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be clear for voters and observers to see that they are empty at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except for those of eligible and authorized voters.
The candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In her other event, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the seated women’s division with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's group failed to finish their race, and 45 out of 117 skiers failed to qualify for the Giant Slalom race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
According to Deputy Inspector General D K Aray, "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when it was hit by a car, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The street where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency responders extricated the driver from his red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred again to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court facing charges of murdering his son.
He is detained while awaiting arraignment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be tainted due to his widely publicized image.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's justice system is different, and the courts have come to view the publication of images as potentially discriminatory.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be walking a tightrope of disaster when publishing photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which oversees all prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comment would be made at least until the trial.
The document, as revealed, pertains to a dispute over territorial issues, with Palestine seeking it based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting a ten-year military presence in the valley upon the signing of an agreement, while the PA agrees to only a five-year presence.
The sharpshooters for the supplemental pest control testing will be carefully managed by rangers, as the testing is monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
Through a partnership between the NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooting Association (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were gathered under the Association's game hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage of NPWS Park, the four shooters selected for the first culling operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
The new Provisional Council (CEP), composed of nine members, swore in yesterday to Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP as part of preparations to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to widespread protests against his administration that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were sparked by frustration over the holding of elections, some of which should have been held as early as 2011.
More than 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods have been reported, causing six fires in total and leaving four people with minor burns.
According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan, they were already aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple’s report delay “truly unfortunate.”
An earthquake occurred in Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office reported no injuries in the country.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as Filipino photographers.
Eventually, photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and worked in the field of medicine.
She studied to become an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating early labor symptoms in his free time.
Her research shows that when a hormone is administered, it can accelerate the maturation of the lungs of a fetus in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight data recorders, or "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Truly one of a kind like her. A brave woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels has stated that "Luna is as strange as I am...perhaps even more so...I love her and I’m drawn to her...I hope she’s in a better place."
In a survey of 1,400 people questioned before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percentage points since 2008.
The Caretaker Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view, hoping that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
At both ends of the survey, 29 percent of those asked believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist swimmer is scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical strength is being questioned.
He is unable to take the drugs he needs to alleviate the pain he is feeling because they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Some people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets are potentially the source of delivering water to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists want to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
He is suspected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
This utilizes satellite-based technology, as opposed to the previous land-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No extra transport is being put on, and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable in the area.
Concerns about transportation shortages have raised the possibility that the fight may be forced to take place behind closed doors, without team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported new types evolving in as little as two generations, even though this process was previously believed to take much longer, due to breeding between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn out until it becomes a thin wire, which can be twisted and threaded. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made extremely thin and adhered to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of red cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of only one proton separate from its electron, and the separated hydrogen ion is commonly called a proton.
Combine the two dry powders by rolling them together, and then, using clean, wet hands, squeeze them until they form a ball shape.
The moisture on your hands will react with the external layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a skin-like layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro back then had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
The remains of flushing toilet systems were found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space will receive the call and return it down almost immediately.
The satellite in space is delivered by rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere causes distortion of some of the light and things we see.
A large rocket, 100 feet tall, is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has transformed the world in remarkable ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is given us easier and faster transportation.
It provided us with the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Following them were many more cats, remarkably sized, that devoured animals of similar remarkable size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including stray cats) are eating increasingly more small prey such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is having a relevant task or a special task to avoid competition among each cat.
Lions are the most friendly cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and young lions.
Women often have close relationships with each other, as a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also fiercely protective of their kills.
A general athlete, a tiger is capable of climbing (though not very well), swimming, jumping long distances, and pulling five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar isn’t like the power of a lion’s roar, but more like a string of growls, shrieking words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals an ocelot seeks are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey animals by scent, sniffing out where they are on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark through night vision, and can also move stealthily. Ocelots catch their prey by camouflaging with their surroundings and then ambushing them.
If a small group of living things (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population they came from (such as if they go to a mountain range or a river, or if they migrate to a new island to make it difficult to return), they often find themselves in a place different from their origin.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be strong competitors than they previously needed.
The original population remains unchanged, they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, their appearance starts to diverge more and more from that of another population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants create their own food from sunlight using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Almost all the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws have 70 sharp teeth, including an extra row on the roof of its mouth, meaning no one who encounters it can escape.
We cannot be certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex could not prevail against it.
Although many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans also had their own remarkable or extraordinary dishes prepared for banquets, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat sitting on chairs, wealthy men prefer to have banquets together where they recline while eating.
The food of Ancient Romans may not have included foods that later came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in subsequent centuries.
For example, they had no corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians erected a main temple for each of their gods, which was recognized as the god’s dwelling.
People will bring offerings to the gods, and the priests will try to attend to the gods’ needs through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple has an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower is a unique sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not considered very important.
Most of the Hebrew family’s life happened outdoors.
Women are cooking in the yard; the shops are just open dispatch stations facing the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the price of wood was very high.
Few people settled in Greenland. In Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for the crime of manslaughter, and while traveling further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever he discovered, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' many differences exist between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie *National Treasure*, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is located on the lower part of the document, and is upside down.
Even though it is uncertain who the author is, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the short note might have been placed simply as a marker.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated Northern France, but its south remained unfree.
It was under the control of the French "Vichy." These were people from France who made an agreement with the Germans in 1940 and became collaborators with the occupiers rather than opponents of them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and support each other, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, meaning civil, related to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, and it also in a way indicates the size of a society.
City-states were the beginnings of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Secondary cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and failing to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first established a weak central government—Congress as its sole branch—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, it depended on the authorities of the states—often uncooperative—to enforce all of its laws.
It also has no power to invalidate laws regarding taxes and tariffs between states.
The articles require unanimous consent from all states before they can be amended, and the states do not take the central government seriously, which is why their representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and became FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Among the popular sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is comprised of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the archipelago of islands that make up Japan, it is often called "islands" because of its geographical location.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production practices and providing employment for Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format worldwide for captured still images is 35mm, which became the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still done today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, in fact, somewhat misleading, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (like APS film families, for example) approximate or are equivalent to this aspect ratio.
The heavily abused and often mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates excitement while maintaining a level of order in an image.
This indicates that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the states of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power has affected everyone from the king to the common person.
One of the core principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are there for that specific purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being met.
It wasn't long after the outbreak of hostilities that Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies for both the military and civilians, although this blockade violated customary international law established as a system through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire part of the ocean, causing danger even to neutral vessels.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing custom of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different eras; each period of Chinese history or each family in power was a specific dynasty.
Between each dynasty also lay periods of disunity with fragmented provinces. The most well-known of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, a fierce war occurred between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people perishing while vying to ascend to the highest position in the opulent palace in Xi’an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Similarly, after the Revolution, jobs opened up to all male applicants, giving the most ambitious and successful the opportunity to prosper.
This can also be said of the military, as instead of army ranks being based on lineage, they are now based on prowess in warfare.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to initiate their own revolutions.
Muhammad developed a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to the cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for his contemplation.
The very cave, which has survived through the ages, offers a remarkably clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s not really easy to find even though someone knows it exists. Once inside the cave, you are truly isolated.
All that can be seen is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Only a tiny fraction of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that remains today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the large pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains many pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The mark for "upward slant" looks like a V, and the mark for "downward slant" is similar to a staple or a square without the bottom part.
Going upwards means you should start at the end and push the plane, and going downwards means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the plane) and pull the plane.
Upward glides typically produce weaker sounds, while downward glides are louder and more assertive.
Feel free to write in your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed markings for fingerings are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King’s sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of women in the market to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The King and Queen were forced to open the carriage windows wide due to the persistent solicitations/importunings.
Once, a member of the crowd waved the head of the king's guard captain, who had been killed at Versailles, before the terrified Queen.
The costs of the United States’ imperialist wars in its conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to fund a large portion of expenses and the interest on bonds sold in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the excess profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will form the primary benefit of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that motivated the formation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, a stage in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and was succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a vast range of ideas, from technology push or an intense technological imperative to the precise understanding that the fate of humanity is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the very advancement of technology follows a trajectory beyond cultural or political power, and that this technology has “effects” on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars drive the construction of roads.
However, the national road network would not be a worthwhile business if it were only for a few vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning many cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which has led to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a strong element of cultural determinism, originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in accordance with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its recognition as a center of luxury began in 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century due to the fact that Christian conquerors or Crusaders returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices, which were valued even more highly than what the Byzantine market could offer.
This was the time when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at the peak of its popularity during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western fashion trends can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest advancements during that time, a result of the Crusades, was people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that utilizes saved seeds native to the eco-region along with crop rotation or other arguably simple methods to increase yields.
According to history, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite people with similar mindsets who feel neglected according to societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their affiliation through distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to base it on the unfavorable conditions of children who were not taught good manners by adults while growing up through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have previously been confined by people (often their own parents); in other cases, this abandonment of the child is due to the parents’ rejection of the child’s severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who have limited social interaction from a young age may have first experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the forest all alone.
When animals have fully matured, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within their physical limitations) almost identical to those displayed by the nurturing animal, such as fearfulness or a cold demeanor towards humans.
Although project-based learning should facilitate and make studying interesting, providing scaffolding is often more effective.
Providing components for study or outlining (scaffolding) is not a method of learning but rather an aid that offers support to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real. This means a teacher is a form of scaffold, as is Clippy from Microsoft Office.
Virtual frameworks are embedded within the software and aim to question, prompt, and explain procedures that students may have found difficult to tackle on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages for a multitude of different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet they exist.
We consider orphanages safe places for these children.
Our orphanage system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, continuous education, and reliable healthcare.
The orphanage should be the one to provide all the needs that were lacking in the former homes they came from.
The Internet has united the elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet are opening avenues for additional forms regarding uses and gratifications theory.
For example, “studying” and “socializing” are suggested as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of listener motivation when they investigated reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting subtle expressions—facial movements that occur for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that a person can determine if someone is lying by correctly interpreting their subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech," suggested how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior might be the same in animals, like domesticated dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic diversity: hidden and overt.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes those that are not actually useful from the pool of variations.
The shuffling of segregation and recombination repeatedly introduces variation between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from plant-based sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest resources to obtain from plants are the proteins found in leaves and seeds, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal-sourced foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a wealth of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that monkeys in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep time and returning to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
It’s easy to do this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself changing the clock while sleepy, you can place it across the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Some biologically-based options require drinking a lot of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which prompts one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
If tension is lower, the life force that exists will be more positive. Every person has the potential to find complete peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing hindering this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded by the Mahayana path of compassion and a vast number of techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all loving ones.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy of Kundalini (energy of the divine feminine) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. By visualizing various deities in the mind, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany became the enemy of everyone during World War 2, which led to cooperation between the USSR and USA. At the end of the war, conflicts in systems, processes, and culture caused disagreements between nations.
Within two years of the war’s end, former allies became adversaries and the Cold War began.
This will last for the next 40 years and will truly be fought by proxy armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and other locations.
On September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had collapsed, and their only hope was to withdraw and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, whether bilateral or multilateral.
Using ships for transporting products is the best way overall for moving large numbers of people and products across the oceans.
Traditionally, the job of naval forces is to ensure your country maintains the ability to move its people and products, while simultaneously hindering your adversary's ability to move theirs.
One of the most recent and notable examples of this is the WWII (World War II) North Atlantic campaign. The Americans were then trying to get men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, was attempting to disrupt this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have conquered Britain as it had already done with most of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated almost 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, feathers, meat, and hides.
Pet goats are often placed in herds that roam the mountains or other pastures, usually tended by shepherds who are often children or young people, similar to more well-known shepherds. This method of herding is still used today.
Railway tracks were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though carts are constructed from aligned wooden planks, it allows horses to pull them faster and haul larger loads than on somewhat rougher roads.
Ties were used early on to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a narrow piece of steel on top.
This practice became widespread, but the introduction of steel caused the further deterioration of the wooden wheels of carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rail was introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, which began around two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) when people started walking upright.
Those who came before them, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is customary.
Specialized bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have already been walking on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a way that is less harmful to our environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future, in some way.
This is similar to treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary fix, then we should find the root of the problems and we should stop them from functioning.
It is clear that the world has significantly changed due to advancements in science and technology by humanity, and problems have become more complex due to overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyles of people.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, several blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon on the grounds of the Freedom Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which he read to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't believe they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still so many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk using their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all currently used computers are based on controlling information encoded through binary numbers.
The binary number system can only have one of two values, e.g., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, when using computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are often general enough that immediate diagnosis is not possible.
The most telling sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or poisonous chemicals in the house.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from the ancient understanding of Surot, insects remarkably adapted to infest humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs both depend for a long time on their hosts after birth, adapted to live in the nest or den of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and it is considered a leading neurological disorder among younger people and adults in mid-life.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise an infant.
The couple may decide to put their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method indeed guides most scientific research.
This isn't done in isolation; experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questioning and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, especially, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, are accepted.
With the decline of Greek learning, the West found itself distanced from its philosophical and scientific Greek origins.
Many of the rhythms observed in the structure of the body and behavior are highly dependent on what is happening inside their bodies and their production through a biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external seasonal cues, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue the timing of free-running cycles even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments marking either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have varying effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are cells for sexual reproduction.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the plants and animals in the forest.
Examples of actual activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and learning about environmental information.
An example of this is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every day, people leave the small towns of the country by car to get to their workplaces, passing others for whom their workplace is the place they came from.
With the dynamic coming and going of this transportation, all people in one way or another are connected to, and support, a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Current science suggests that this large-scale carbon economy has shifted the Earth’s ecological system (biosphere) from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers truly incompetent? Or is something else more important happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Sadly, analyzing traffic flow is not easy because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave predictably within a fixed range; therefore, traffic flow doesn't change much and can be estimated using mathematics.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in planning, designing, and managing road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily overcome their enemies and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
It gives them a wider range of small areas to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Many people believed he was right, but many more believed the opposite—that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, along with the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems meaningful, because you don’t feel like the world is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes being six miles wide.
The full 20 percent of the water flowing from rivers on the planet to the seas comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids using stone did not cease until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in their size and the technical skill of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest people.
The City of Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these could be discovered in nature in native form and were easily mined using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also posited that they transform into new things to create what we see.
Alloys are typically mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table and some of them are metals as well (such as calcium and potassium) and can be mixed with other metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys with a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny things called atoms.
Atoms are unbelievably tiny, with trillions of them able to fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it was invented.
It's sad that as new ways of writing have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and fewer uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, never needing to approach a pencil sharpener.
A person will only find out what a keyboard can do when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works based on the principle that energy needs to combine the nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Perhaps it's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Thus, nuclear fission releases that energy to others.
Some atoms are those with an imbalance in the number of protons and neutrons, meaning they are likely to decay when there is a small or no matching number of protons and neutrons.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the plains and thicker under the highlands.
There might be many more Maria (volcanoes) in the areas visible on Earth because the Earth's crust is thinner there. It’s easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates people or captures their attention.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they embrace as they age.
These theories concern what drives some people to want to do things and what factors in their environment motivate them to do or not do things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make decisions that many won’t like, to discipline, to evaluate performance, to assign responsibility, and to hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels they should change everything the group is already doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is truly responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to misunderstandings between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are also held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often serve as the point of contact for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of typical teams because their teams can meet according to different time zones that their local management may not be able to accommodate.
The presence of a genuine "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinctive part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the overseeing team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One goal for actively practicing the concepts of an organizational learning is innovation.
If all resources are used effectively throughout the active departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity will be revealed.
As a result, the organization's collaborative process for overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process for serving customer needs.
Before an organization of innovative ideas can even be established, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating learning ability. Therefore, it limits the field of research and makes it more precise.
Scientists in their research establish the connection between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumatic experiences, wounds, and unusual growths can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The increase in new technology has allowed us to see and analyze brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong association with science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, concerning the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines that automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Among the tasks of AI are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer assessments and customer inquiries, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and human faces.
These things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, similar to what has been achieved in software applications for many home computers and video games.
The field trip is a significant part of every classroom. Teachers often really want to take their students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution through virtual educational tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire fine art while seated with their class.
Sharing educational trips virtually is also a wonderful way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with in-person classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, and each year the website’s structure is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this typically improves with the presence of readers.
Because students are often the most critical of audiences, the blogger began to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "compels students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to capture the public’s interest opens students up to being resourceful and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is a way to foster collaboration, and encourages students to continue learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs “can empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can identify their positions in the context of others’ writings as well as formulate their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is a captivating capital city of Canada, bilingual, and features numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
In the distant south lies Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and many more feature Ontario as what outsiders consider to be quintessentially Canadian.
The vast areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some are almost wilderness with no inhabitants.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than citizens of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and can be considered a continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became very important in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The Sahara is on the northern border of the region, and to the south and west is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women traveling with a man state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It would help to also wear a ring (as long as it doesn’t look too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in what they perceive as harassment and what is commonly considered following, touching an arm, etc.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether there are cultural differences or not, it is still unacceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan from Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the places in all of Morocco that isn't an interesting place to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, earthenware, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of trinkets, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in its far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lahars from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the town's roads, particularly in the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with offering some of the most affordable gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can ride a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The typical (local) fare is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Along with being difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic and faraway lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is a struggling village, although its reputation is the reason for its popularity as a tourist destination, and it has an airplane station.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of endangered World Heritage Sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main destinations for Henry Louis Gates in his PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is very different from all other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic style than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the pride of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all National Parks in South Africa, there is a daily conservation fee and park entry fee.
It may also be beneficial for a person to purchase a Wild Card, which will allow entry to any of the selected parks in South Africa or to all of the National Parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the territory’s name, Hong Kong, and the area recognized by many tourists as its main focus.
The skyline of towering buildings in Hong Kong, a parade of structures, has been likened to a glittering bar chart, a view made possible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the development of the cities of Hong Kong Island is located on the heavily reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place claimed by British colonizers as their own, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest along the coastline in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland into the provinces of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps—they include some of the last remaining hopes for the mighty forests that once covered the Ganges plains.
The Sundarbans covers 3,850 km², one-third of which is submerged in water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for elusive animals, and it is estimated to now have 409 Royal Bengal tigers and almost 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since intercity buses are often full, it’s best to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts were served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which were convenient and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two passageways 3.50 meters wide.
The height of the space under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, once the construction of the Brazilian customs inspection facilities is completed.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group currently inhabiting eastern Paraguay, living as somewhat nomadic hunters who also practice agriculture for their livelihood.
The Chaco region became home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the clash between Spanish conquistadors and groups of native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is world-renowned for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is happening in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
You can also find smaller competitions and battles here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentinian Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is valued at par with the British pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the exclusive bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the Western FIC store.
British pounds are commonly accepted anywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards are also frequently accepted, as are US dollars.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency can often be obtained; check with owners beforehand to find out what forms of payment are best.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures exceeding +30°C are common.
Winter can have a deceptive chill: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel much colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals however are ferocious and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials say to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how gentle they may look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors get injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, it should be known that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking strongly scented foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbor was the site of a famous standoff between naval forces in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town gathering resulted in the murder of the most important chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of this is sandy beach where it's safe to wade, most of which are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded beaches visited by families and have a good selection of shops found along the shore. It is safe to swim in the sea.
The main local beer is 'Numero Uno', it's not a complex beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines available for purchase, but New Zealand and Australian wines may hold up better during travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you’re concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A 'short black' is an 'espresso', a cappuccino comes with a high mound of crema (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate adheres to Belgian standards. Fruit juice drinks are expensive but very delicious.
Many instances of going to the rocky areas at sea (reef) occur throughout the year, and damage caused by any reason related to the reef is rare.
However, follow the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Dugongs appear near coastlines and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They are occasionally sighted outside of these periods.
There are indeed sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively inhabit the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing they have a place to stay once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents commonly offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even packages combining flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or take care of other documents for your trip (e.g., visa).
Any changes or requests must first be coursed through the travel agency representative and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, go early to secure lodging near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, parts of the festival may continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children.
When going to the Northern Baltic during winter, check the location of the sleeping houses, as going onto the ice can cause rather severe noise for those intentionally affected.
Sea voyages to Saint Petersburg require spending time in town. Travelers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos typically make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by visitors. Windows and clocks are often absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep guests feeling good and encourage them to stay.
Several places offer free alcohol. However, intoxication impairs decision-making ability, and all skilled gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or on mountain roads should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is limited and you can’t drive as if you’re on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow to strand you can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility through the vehicle windows may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is not disrupted year-round.
Animal observation or safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to a journey overland to view the magnificent wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are inclined to approach cars closely, and common equipment can allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy sometimes, and you are more likely to see them using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "foot safari") involves hiking, which can last for several hours or multiple days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Several events will be held in different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you already booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will range in price from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with average tickets costing ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available, even if they are not inside the room.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this is the cause of clothes shrinking, or in severe cases, burns).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, more than one minute is required.
The effectiveness of water filters varies, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests or animals unfamiliar to them from their region of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in more severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly harm or kill people, are often not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods free of taxes at specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes may sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The length of the road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through remote, forested terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on provincial roads, be alert: the roads are steep, narrow, and have sudden curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower compared to previous and subsequent sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is far more important than before.
Surprisingly, however, the mobile phone service is stronger here than along many other routes, for example, the Pennsylvania Forests.
German pastries are delicious, and in Bavaria, they are flavorful and diverse, similar to those in its southern neighboring country, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are cooked into pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts are also featured in many German bread products. Popular cakes are often enjoyed with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but fluffy breads, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on what they're called in the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the regions of North India and Pakistan far from the sea, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Because Indonesia has 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing the wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without additional adjectives, the term usually refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a succession of simply seasoned dishes, with Javanese flavoring favoring peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups on both sides of the horse serve as support for the rider's feet.
These provide more stability for riders but may pose a safety concern due to the possibility of riders’ feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has one foot still caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs. To reduce the risk, there are several precautions that can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, durable soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow the stirrup iron to fall from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – the premier climbing area in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, and featuring a variety of large granite walls and slopes.
The peaks feature breathtaking views from the summits. Climbers from different parts of the world continuously establish new routes amidst the endless potential of its walls.
Ice sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving fast descents on icy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a primary activity for many avid travelers, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport began around the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called backcountry ski, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related, but alpine touring or mountaineering styles using skis are not commonly employed, as the latter are done on steep terrain and require more rigid skis and boots.
Imagine that the ski route is a route similar to hiking.
In good conditions, you can cover somewhat longer distances than walking – but you’ll rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on a groomed trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means going through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen Area functions, however, in a manner similar to a country in this respect.
While you remain in this zone, you can cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don’t need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antiques. Some tax agencies define products over 100 years old as antiques.
The meaning varies depending on the region of the world, where the length of a year can be shorter in places in North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be considered antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding this occupation is also important for many who have other professions.
Even according to tradition, although not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, reindeer were mostly kept as working animals.
Now, many Sámi people are employed in modern livelihoods. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the land of the Sámi people.
Although widely used, especially by non-Roma people, the term "Gitano" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma people.
If the country you are traveling to is under a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may become effective.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different experiences than Europeans or Arabs.
Alerts are simply brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The viewpoints presented are often superficial, generalized, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, widespread disruption of society, or loss of human life.
Terrible weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and it comes in various forms, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are types and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and typhoons.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events including blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be alert to the risk of severely bad weather affecting their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for 'Course About a Hostile Environment' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course typically covers all the issues discussed here in more detail, often with practical experience.
A course typically lasts from 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and newspapers discussing wilderness survival are common, but publications covering war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The readiness of governments to issue passports indicating non-binary gender (X) or amended documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as widely.
Security checkpoint investigations have become more intrusive since the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity fully intact.
Strong waves are the backwash from waves breaking on the shoreline, often over rocks or a reef or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper areas, and fast currents can form there.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion trying to swim back against the wave, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back won't be any harder than usual.
Try to reach a place where you won't be swept away again, or, depending on your abilities and if you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of re-entry comes sooner than culture shock (it has less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Sometimes, travelers who easily adapt to a new culture find it even harder to readjust to their own culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you’ve become accustomed to the new culture and have lost some of your customs from your own country’s culture.
When you went to a foreign country for the first time, people were likely patient and understanding, because they know that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People might not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You will observe the pyramids in the darkness and you will observe them silently before the show begins.
You usually always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx served as the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes show the pyramids, and the different pyramids are lighting up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, inhabited by Villa Las Estrellas.
Among these are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a remarkable natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then reappear to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, reaching a height of 4892 m Mount Vinson.
In remote areas where there is no cell phone signal, a satellite phone is your only option.
Satellite phones are not typically a replacement for mobile phones, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships for sea voyages, including pleasure crafts for travelers, and for trips requiring data acquisition and communication.
The local telephone service provider is expected to provide additional information on how to access this service.
The increasingly popular travel option for those planning mid-year trips is to travel and learn.
It is very popular among students taking a gap year, allowing them to take a year off before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually improve your chances of transferring to higher education in your own country.
Typically, there will be tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a very beautiful destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, located in the lakes and archipelagos along the coastline.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't always need a yacht.
Although the islands near the continental coast and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a unique experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise is truly exceptional (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Almost all unique Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two full days while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only disembark at the shoreline using a cruise ship for sightseeing, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some sea voyages feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and visiting the location is not included in the cost of the sea voyage.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people regardless of their age and background, especially if they haven't flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
There’s no shame in this: it’s no different from personal fears and dislikes that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight may help overcome fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Delivery companies are paid well for the fast delivery of items. Often, time is critical for business documents, merchandise, or parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own airplanes, but on other routes and with smaller companies, there’s a problem.
When they ship the goods by air vehicles, it may take several more days via other routes to clear discharge and customs.
The only way for this to get through faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow shipping these items without an accompanying passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first or business class is to pay a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a gauge of standards, expect you may pay up to four times the regular economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there is no reason to look for further discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that certain groups of travelers are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and conveniently, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but the Russian language is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered due to ethnic conflict.
In 1994, disagreements led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very important transportation hub.
Once an ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, thriving, and bustling commercial center, located around a large coastline and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are juxtaposed with traditional tiled red roofs, the 18th-century marketplace, and old Muslim mosques and churches of other religions, although the city has a more Mediterranean European ambiance than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

To the north, also visit the grand (Shrine of) the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place of Marian apparitions known throughout the world.
Please remember that you are visiting a mass grave site, as well as a place with almost immeasurable significance to a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived the time they spent there, and many more who had loved ones killed or who died from the hardship of working there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with all the honor, sincerity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not defile the beauty of this place by destroying its structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, almost all signs are written only in Catalan because it was established by law as the first official language.
However, the use of Spanish was also widespread in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced through an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
People from Paris have a reputation for being selfish, rude, and arrogant.
Although it’s often just a mistaken stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to display good manners, acting as if you are “bien élevé” (well-bred). This will make socializing much easier.
The rough demeanor of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show simple respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has diverse plant communities due to its range of microclimates, varied terrains, and different elevation levels.
The area is also home to a vast number of animal species and bird types.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with more common species.
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and must also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide veils for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the supply upon entry, but that garment isn't washed after each use, so you might not be comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mojarcan cuisine, like that of other Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, next to the word "Sie" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing becomes slightly more complicated due to the need to know if the verb or adjective is used in a nominalized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced similarly to how they are spelled.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Likewise, be sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means expensive, but carro means carriage.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, reading the introductory book of this grammar will help you learn many things about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
It goes without saying, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can immediately conclude that it is so similar to Portuguese that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Observatories built before the modern era are often obsolete today, remaining as museums or places for education.
Because light pollution wasn’t yet the problem it is today when these were popular, they were often located in cities or on campuses, which were easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are very large facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea of choosing plum blossoms as the flower originated in China.
In Japan, the earliest gatherings associated with cherry blossoms were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the urge to take even “just one” specimen.
If visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also result in your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and it’s very easy to find attractions there, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But due to being located in the "higher tropics"—just a few degrees north of the equator—you have to contend with both heat (constantly) and intense sun (when the skies are clear, though less frequently).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Look at the bus you're thinking of taking – it's going into Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Waterways far from the coast can be a good theme for basing a vacation on.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising on a pleasure boat to interesting cities on the Danube, or canoeing on the Erie Canal.
They also identify routes for well-known trails for long walks and cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian festivals, and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions practiced during Christmas are now followed by non-Christian countries and non-Christians all over the world.
There's a tradition of staying awake during Holy Week to witness the sunrise.
There are, of course, theological explanations within Christian theology for this tradition, but it is likely that it was a Spring and Abundance ritual even before Christianity.
More traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil on Holy Saturday night at the end of Easter week, when congregations typically celebrate the observance at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally reached the islands arrived here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because the distance from the continent was so far, mammals were unable to travel, making large tortoises the primary originating animals in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of people in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience long nights or polar night, which means the sun does not rise.
It offers a beautiful opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark for approximately twenty-four hours.
Because the population is sparse in these areas, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The work culture of the Japanese is more based on rank and formality than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are the typical business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or their job titles.
Collaboration in the workplace is extremely important, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual accomplishments.
Workers often need to obtain approval from their superiors for any decisions they make, and are expected to follow the orders of those above them without question.
