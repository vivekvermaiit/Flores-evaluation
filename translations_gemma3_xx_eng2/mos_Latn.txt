This is a difficult sentence, and a truly *perfect* translation requires deep cultural context. However, here's a close, functional translation, aiming for accuracy based on typical Mossi sentence structure and vocabulary: “Truly, the story of Bali is very old; it speaks of a time when the world was dark, and people didn’t know how to live well, and they suffered greatly from hunger and poverty, but a certain powerful woman emerged and showed them the way to a better life, bringing abundance and prosperity." **Important Notes on Challenges & Nuances:** * **"Yella taab n be tʋʋm-gãnegdga"**: This is a complex opening. "Yella taab" often signifies "truly" or "indeed". The rest refers to the age/history of the story itself. * **"kẽesa duniyã weooga tiisa koglgo"**: "Kẽesa" means 'time', "duniyã" means 'world'. "Weooga" is dark and "tiisa koglgo" is a phrase describing a difficult, unenlightened era. * **"pʋɩ bangre n nan sõng tẽns-nins sẽn"**: This section describes the suffering - hunger, poverty, hardship. * **"yidgdaba paam pemsmã rẽgenga boogr wʋsgo"**: This part speaks of the powerful woman who brought change, and the positive outcomes (abundance, prosperity). "Boogr wʋsgo" implies a significant transformation. * **Grammatical structure:** Mossi is a tonal language, and word order can be flexible. This translation prioritizes conveying the *meaning* in natural English.

It refers to a family (Rom’s) enduring a lingering, difficult sickness. `tare` means suffering, `toore` persistent, `kibsẽn` sickness. The repetition with `bõn-sãang` and `bõn-lingr` emphasize the ongoing nature of the problem (“that doesn’t stop/end”). `tẽedo` signifies that it’s not resolving. * **"n ning suk wa kurku-raoogo, paon, garweongo, la rũm bile bull boonde tɩ loir"**: This is a lament about the inability to provide. `suk` strength/ability. `kurku-raoogo`, `paon`, `garweongo` are core activities for survival (farming, hunting, building). `rũm bile bull boonde tɩ loir` - Everything is broken/falling apart, and there’s nowhere to find help/refuge. **Important Note:** Mossi, like many African languages, is heavily context-dependent.

This is the most complex part. "Imaasã" means "he/she wants". "Ratio" in this context implies quality. "Numerɩk foto" is digital camera.

This is a difficult sentence with nuanced cultural context. Here's a translation aiming for accuracy and natural English, along with explanations of choices made: **English Translation:** We are returning with thanks for the good things you did for us, and we hope our children will also remember and appreciate what you have done for us, so that our connection will remain strong and lasting. **Explanation of key elements & translation choices:** * **"Koob kitsa lagamda"**: Literally "We return with gratitude/thanks." "Kitsa lagamda" is a standard phrase for expressing thanks. * **"neb sẽn n tare yaama ye la b teed ti"**: This complex phrase translates to "for the good things you did for us". "Sẽn" means things/matters. "Tare yaama" means good things. "Ye la b teed ti" is "you did for us." * **"nin bouide mininemg ka naan bamb ye la song bamb ti"**: This is where the cultural nuance comes in. "Nin bouide mininemg" refers to "our children". "Ka naan bamb" means "so they will remember". "Ye la song bamb ti" means "they will also appreciate/value". The idea is a hope that the *next* generation will carry on the remembering and appreciating. * **"toog wilge yaa neb ninsã"**: This means "so that our connection will remain strong and lasting". "Toog wilge" signifies a strong and enduring bond or relationship. "Neb ninsã" means "our connection". It's important to note that Mossi often relies on implication and contextual understanding. This translation aims to capture the *spirit* of the sentence, which is one of gratitude, respect, and a desire for a continued relationship across generations.

This is a difficult sentence, highly idiomatic and with some potential ambiguity due to the nature of Mossi. However, here's a translation attempting to capture the full meaning, considering context is missing: **They say that life is short, the world is full of trouble and hardship, that a person should not be overly proud or boastful, because the future is uncertain and tomorrow may bring unexpected difficulties, and that one should always be humble and respectful to avoid falling into misfortune.** **Important Notes:** * **"A wʋsg fa"** – This is a common way to introduce a saying or proverb, translating to "They say..." or "It is said..." * **"tʋg n guls n kee kareng da pa n ka sa zanga"** - This describes the troubles and hardships of the world. * **"zanga n na yilli n tʋg n karm zamaan zeng ya bũmbu n tõe song tɩ f le paam sore"** - This part discusses the uncertainty of the future. * **"tʋg n le sɩng karem beda f bayiri"** - This advises humility and respect to avoid misfortune. Without further context, this is the most accurate and comprehensive translation possible. Mossi often relies on implied meaning and cultural understanding, making direct word-for-word translation insufficient.

This is a difficult sentence with nuanced cultural context! Here's the best translation I can provide, aiming for both accuracy and readability, along with explanations of the challenges: **Translation:** “The problem with youth today is that they don’t listen; they only want to do what pleases them, and they disrespect elders – they think they are wiser. (Yes, sometimes we were also like that, but we learned through hardship and listening to advice).” **Explanation of Challenges & Choices:** * **"Vẽenegr n kẽed"**: Literally "problem of youth," but idiomatically translates to "the problem with youth." * **"yik ne sɩlga a pipi goeelsa"**: This is a complex phrasing. "Yik" means "listen", "sɩlga" means "they" (plural pronoun), "pipi" means "only", "goeelsa" means "want/desire". Together it conveys a lack of receptiveness and a focus on self-desire. * **"zutu yaa f sak n yãk ligd wʋsgo n na yilẽ n paam yõodo"**: This section is about disrespecting elders. "Zutu" means "respect", "yaa f" signifies negation, "sak n yãk" refers to older people/elders, "ligd wʋsgo" means "think they are", "yilẽ" means "wise", "paam yõodo" means "more than". This section expresses the idea that the youth think they are wiser than their elders. * **"(bɩ, n le são, yaa f kɩt tɩ f tʋʋm zĩig bao n kõ fo)"**: This is a reflective clause, meaning "Yes, we also were like that, but we learned through hardship and listening to advice". "bɩ" is yes, "le são" means "we also," "kɩt tɩ f tʋʋm zĩig bao" is a beautiful phrase meaning “we learned through hardship,” and "kõ fo" means to listen to advice. It's important to note that some Mossi phrases carry cultural weight that is hard to perfectly replicate in English. This translation aims to capture the *meaning* and *tone* of the original sentence as accurately as possible.

This is a complex sentence with cultural references! Here's a translation attempting to capture the meaning as accurately as possible, acknowledging some nuance may be lost without deeper context: “The stories our grandparents told us about the past – about heroes, skillful hunters, powerful diviners, beautiful women, and strong men – those are like the large, colorful butterflies we see; they bring joy and wonder, but their wings are fragile, and we must protect and cherish them so they don't disappear.” **Explanation of choices and difficulties:** * **Weoog-bõn-vɩɩlɩ:** This refers to stories, traditions, or teachings passed down from ancestors (grandparents specifically mentioned). * **ka tʋʋle:** "about" or "concerning". * **n yata wala yerope wurs munuga:** This lists qualities of people from the past – heroes, skillful hunters, diviners, etc. "Wurs" is often used for people with special skills. * **katre, pa-nand-tugri, vĩnlɩɩla, rindisga, we-yũuga:** These are further descriptors, adding to the picture of admirable people. *katre* (strong), *pa-nand-tugri* (skillful/clever), *vĩnlɩɩla* (beautiful), *rindisga* (powerful/influential) and *we-yũuga* (brave) * **grand tetras tõe paama be:** This is a metaphorical comparison to large, colorful butterflies – something visually striking and pleasant. "Tetras" doesn’t literally mean butterflies, but in Mossi storytelling, it can refer to beautiful and delicate things. *paama* means colour. * **la ub buuda taab wʋsg me n paase:** This final part is a plea for preservation – to protect and cherish these stories so they don’t vanish. *paase* means to disappear. It’s important to note that Mossi storytelling often relies on imagery and indirect expression, so a single "literal" translation won't fully convey the depth of the original. I've prioritized conveying the *meaning* and *spirit* of the sentence.

This is a difficult sentence, highly contextual and with some potential ambiguity due to the nature of Mossi and its reliance on tone and context. However, here's the best possible translation, aiming for accuracy while acknowledging potential nuances lost in translation: **"Truly, the history of our ancestors is very important; it teaches us lessons and guides us to a bright future, like the Perse star guiding travelers. We must respect and preserve this history for the benefit of generations to come."** **Explanation of key parts & choices made:** * **Ri yinga:** Literally "Truly/Indeed" – sets a tone of emphasis. * **gom-wʋgb kang kareng hala:** "History of our ancestors" – *gom-wʋgb* (history), *kang kareng* (our ancestors), *hala* (of/belonging to). * **sɩngre n wa songde:** "is very important/significant" – *sɩngre* (important), *n wa* (very), *songde* (to us/for us). * **f la me tɩ f bãng bũmb wʋsg:** "it teaches us lessons and guides us" – complex construction implying teaching and guidance. *tɩ* (it), *bãng bũmb wʋsg* (lessons and guidance). * **Perse buuda gom-wʋgba pʋga la f fãam:** "like the Perse star guiding travelers" – *Perse* (Perse - referencing a star, often used metaphorically for guidance), *buuda* (star), *gom-wʋgba* (travelers), *pʋga* (to guide), *fãam* (like/as). * **a goama soãma:** "for generations to come/the benefit of future generations" – *goama* (future), *soãma* (generations). It's crucial to note that this is an interpretation. A native Mossi speaker, given the specific context where this sentence was uttered, might phrase it slightly differently.
