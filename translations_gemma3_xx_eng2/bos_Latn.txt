This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a known theory, but also allows for details that fossils usually cannot provide, relating to colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top, with a pale or yellowish-orange-red underside.
The discovery provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds as well.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – barbs and tiny barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development in relation to those other features.
The structure of these feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers note that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers from an adult, not a juvenile.
Research has shown that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample displays adult feathers and not downy feathers.
A car bomb that detonated yesterday at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured over twenty other people.
From the governor's office, it was announced that nineteen injured individuals were police officers.
Police announced they suspect a suspected Daesh (ISIL) militant responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun functions on the same basic principles as other stars. It has been determined that the activity of all stars in the system is governed by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rozbiev number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rozbijev number, the less active the star is with regard to magnetic field inversions.

The completed work was largely of a theoretical nature, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts Earth and thus causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most dark matter is located around the galaxy in a sort of halo, and consists of a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered a strain of tuberculosis extremely resistant to drugs (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In the interview, he said that the new variant is "very problematic and alarming due to the high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes some patients may have contracted an infection in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers.
Over a period of one year, an infected person could infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in the entire group of people with tuberculosis remains low – 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected individuals at any given time in South Africa.

They are cooler than the surrounding areas during the day, and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep cavities in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the Astrogeology Team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France is done without technology. Voters are isolated in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot paper in an envelope, marking the candidate for whom they are voting.
After election officials verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
These procedures are quite strictly regulated by French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are placed inside for those voters who have been properly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to monitor each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In her second race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the leading Austrian, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani who finished ninth.
Four female skiers in the women's Paralympic category failed to finish the run, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not finish the race.
Police from the Madhya Pradesh region have found and returned a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D K Arya stated: “We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and we have found and returned her mobile phone and laptop.”
The defendants are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were extracting the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been before the sheriff court in Edinburgh since then, charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness testimony could be dismissed because her image has been published numerous times.
This is common practice in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts considered it possible that the publication of photographs could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “it seems journalists are really walking a tightrope if they publish photos of suspects.”
The Crown Office, fully responsible for criminal prosecution, indicated to reporters that no further comment would be given, at least until an indictment is filed.
According to leaked information, the document will reportedly concern the dispute over borders that Palestine wants to base on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle Eastern War.
Other topics reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, posing a problem in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in this valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA accepts a military presence of only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pilot program for pest control should have been under the close supervision of rangers, as the pilot program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited in accordance with the Association’s game hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage within NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial culling operation received detailed safety briefings and training.
Yesterday, nine members of the newly formed Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) took the oath of office before Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed that the previous CEC resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Sporadic violent protests erupted due to the failure to hold elections, some of which haven’t been held since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having information about 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company states “are not serious.”
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's report delay "truly unfortunate."
An earthquake struck Marijana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM Friday GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management has announced that no damage has been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former police officer from the Philippines held tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired from his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages were released earlier, including children, the elderly, and photographers from the Philippines.
Photographers later took the place of the elderly lady when she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Following in his father’s footsteps, Liggins began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the State Maternity Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he researched preterm labor in his free time.
His research showed that administering hormones will accelerate the maturation of a baby's lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two flight data recorders, or "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that “Luna was the first queen of hardcore. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Golddust” Runnels commented, “Luna was as strange as I was…maybe even more so…I loved her and I will miss her…I hope she’s in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
As part of the 2010 federal election campaign, the transitional government's prime minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of respondents who would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch in Australia.
The survey revealed two types of extreme views: 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, and in three stages at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is in doubt due to complaints.
He couldn't take the medication needed to relieve pain because those medications were banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people had confirmed the discovery by the beginning of February using various hardware and software, as was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source for delivering water to Earth along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, became governor at the beginning of this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors political babble and nonsense.
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and also reducing carbon emissions.
Use satellite-based technology instead of outdated ground-based radar technology, so that air traffic controllers can locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be put on, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and bus interchange parking are unavailable near the stadium.
Fear of transport shortages has increased the likelihood that the match might have to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Nauka presented claims about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species evolved in just two generations, despite previous beliefs that the process took much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into various shapes. It can be twisted into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be bent and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, then make a ball from them with clean, wet hands.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will lead to a strange sensation and create a kind of protection.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, nearly every house had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in the homes of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women would gather together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is miles away, use a satellite phone.
A satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
To place a satellite or telescope into space, a gigantic rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has provided us with is much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us a train, a car, and many other means of transport.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging in size from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including lost pet cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept, a special skill that each cat possesses and because of which it doesn't compete with others.
Lions are the friendliest cats and live in large groups called prides.
A pack consists of one to three adult males who are related, and up to thirty females and young.
Women are usually closely connected to each other as it involves a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals whose behavior is surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger, like a true all-around athlete, can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The roar of a tiger isn’t like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of angrily shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate their prey by scent, sniffing the ground where those animals have been.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, during a crossing over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island, making it difficult to return), they will often find themselves in an environment that differs from the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population, to be a strong competitor, will need different characteristics or adaptations compared to what they needed previously.
The initial population hasn't changed at all; they still need adjustments as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to a new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants produce food through photosynthesis using the sun. They also provide shade.
From plants, we build houses and make clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator of its time. It feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws contained more than 70 teeth as sharp as razors, along with an additional row on the palate, meaning there was no escape for any creature that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but perhaps she had a forked tongue. Her diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and she may even have been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that went into the water. Even a gigantic dinosaur like a T. rex wasn't a match for him.
While we were already familiar with most of their food, the Romans ate some strange or unusual food at banquets, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
The other difference was that while poor men and women ate sitting on stools, wealthy men preferred to host banquets together where they would recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, which was considered the home of that god.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids were built, called ziggurats, to be part of temples.
The top of the tower represented a particularly sacred shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house wasn’t so important.
Much of the life of Hebrew families took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was incredibly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it that name.
However, regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there during that period.
Although each country was considered "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie *National Treasure*, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are written the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776." The text is printed upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that this large document on parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was initially rolled up and placed in an archive.
So, it's possible the note was added simply as a marker.
With the Normandy landings (D-Day) and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south remained unfree.
Northern France was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1940, and the attack was named "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word civilis, which means civic and relates to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which in a way defines the scale of a society as well.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a lasting cultural trace, and just expansion.
Less prominent cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
According to the Articles of Confederation, during the Revolutionary War, the thirteen allied states first formed a weak central government, whose only component was the Congress.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and given that there was no national executive branch or judiciary, it relied on state bodies for the implementation of acts, bodies that often did not cooperate.
He also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
Members demanded full consensus from all states before any changes could be made, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 63rd largest island in the world! **(Note: The original Bosnian sentence incorrectly states Japan is the 7th largest island. It is actually the 63rd. I have corrected it in the translation for accuracy, assuming that was the intended meaning.)**
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company founded a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiated a change in aboriginal grain production practices, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
Forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
Following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
In Machu Picchu, there are three main structures – Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been renovated so that tourists can get a better sense of how they originally looked.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image format in the world is 35mm, which dominated at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly, its display format was adopted in the format of image sensors in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing – 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the proportional ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of the whole number) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or approximate this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and frequently mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is stated that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under control.
The Christian religion has connected European states for over a thousand years, despite different languages and customs.
Her dominant power influenced everyone – from the king to the common man.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should serve precisely that purpose.
The central organ of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and due to this concentration of power and money, many wonder if this rule is respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in interrupting the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated internationally accepted law codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering parts of the ocean, causing danger even to ships from neutral countries.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and crimes of World War I, nations sought to avoid such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 after accepting a job at Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods. Each phase in Chinese history, or each family that held power, was identifiable as a dynasty.
Additionally, the period between each dynasty represented a period of divided provinces. The most well-known such period was the Era of Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, fierce wars were waged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people perished fighting for the highest position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Additionally, after the positions of the revolution were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to prosper.
The same applies to the military, as instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class peoples in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in topics beyond this earthly life. He often spent time in a cave that became known as “Hira” on Mount “Noor” (light), and he would contemplate.
The cave itself, which has survived all ages, offers a vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find even if someone knows it exists. Once you enter the cave, it's complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and numerous mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, which was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, or the “Giza necropolis,” in Egypt’s Valley of the Dead, lies a series of pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The “bow up” mark looks like a V, and the “bow down” mark like a conjunction or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up-bow means you should start from the tip and push the bow, while down-bow means you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Drawing the bow upwards usually creates a softer sound, while drawing it downwards produces a louder and more assertive tone.
Feel free to write your markings in pencil, but remember that the printed bowings are provided for musical purposes and should be respected.
A frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In the carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats at the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the king and queen to have the windows on their carriages opened wide.
At one point, a mafia member waved the head of a royal guard member killed in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The people of the Philippines paid for the war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the USA to cover a large portion of the costs and interest on bonds launched on behalf of the Philippine Government through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the substantial profits stemming from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the fundamental gain of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that prompted the founding of the order.
The period in which those events took place is commonly referred to as the medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention is considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological drive or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by the basic logic connected to the laws of science and their representation in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has “impacts” on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that motor vehicles inevitably lead to road development.
However, the road network throughout the country is not economically sustainable for just a few cars, which is why new methods of production have developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in healthcare for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, adopted from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture emerged connected to those geographical areas, and they, in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
His status declined in the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valued than anything the Byzantine market offered.
At that time, the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The style of dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was when people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sufficiency agriculture is agriculture whose goal is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that utilizes saved seed from a specific eco-region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar worldviews who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be identified by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that make a subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of subcultures often demonstrate their affiliation through a specific and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to point to several unfortunate cases of children who were not allowed to socialize by adults during their development due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "feral" children. Some feral children were confined (usually by their parents); in some cases, children were abandoned because their parents refused to accept their severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Abandoned children may have experienced violence or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is believed they were raised by animals. Some are thought to have lived independently in the wild.
Having been raised entirely by inhuman animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical limitations) that closely resembles that of the animal that cared for it, such as fear and indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning aims to make learning simpler and more interesting, the “scaffolding” method goes a step further.
“Scaffolding” is not a teaching method, but a support tool that provides assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Help can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is one form of help, but so is the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into software and are designed for testing, guiding, and explaining procedures that might be challenging for a student to perform independently.
Children enter the foster care system for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, through abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment lacking care, tenderness, and education, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system provides a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should fulfill all the needs that were unmet in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
Different characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of access to benefits and fulfilling needs.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
When researching public reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified “personal involvement” and “ongoing connections” as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, one can detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work *The President’s Speech*, noted that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still correctly assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be possessed by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century revealed the fact that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations between those two bases in each generation.
With a digestive system like humans, it can be difficult for primates in the savanna to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Furthermore, if this is not done, it leads to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and pods, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Unlike them, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a huge amount of protein containing essential amino acids.
When all is considered, we shouldn’t be surprised if our ancestors solved the “protein problem” in a similar way to how chimpanzees do today in savannas.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and returning to sleep somewhat later (10-60 minutes).
That can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself repeatedly hitting snooze in your dreams, you can leave your alarm clock on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve consuming a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bed, which will force the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force will be. Every person has the potential to find their absolute peace and fulfillment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded through the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of complete love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, conflicts between systems, processes, and cultures led to disagreements between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought in reality, through proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already collapsed, and the only hope was withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were practically obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of eastern Poland, thereby violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of goods and a large number of people across the ocean.
The traditional role of the navy is to ensure a country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy’s ability to move theirs.
One of the most notable recent examples of this practice is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were attempting to transport troops and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to provide aid to Britain.
At the same time, the German navy primarily attempted to stop this trade using U-boats.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated almost 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were most often kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and were frequently tended by goatherds, usually children or adolescents, similar to today's shepherds. These livestock farming methods are still used today.
Railroad cars were produced in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve higher speeds and haul more cargo than was possible on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Railway ties were introduced relatively early to secure the rails. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be much more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced with iron wheels. The first solid iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means "upright man").
Their ancestors, australopithecines, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal adaptations have been observed in australopithecine fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although there is a possibility that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs even earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly towards the environment, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This often feels like treating the symptoms rather than the cause. But if we don’t want just a temporary fix, we should find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is clear that the world has changed considerably due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and that problems have grown due to overpopulation and people’s extravagant lifestyles.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby printing shop of John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of that document was held by John Nixon on July 8th, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 known surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest extant examples of that document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds by which they still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with hooves and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite general, making an immediate diagnosis difficult.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open box of medication or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "buba" is used by entomologists in a formal context for this group of insects.
This expression stems from a long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both bed bugs and common crimson bugs are reddish, adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may decide to make a plan to adopt a baby.
In the adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine, using the scientific method, how the world works. In fact, most scientific research is guided by this method.
However, it’s not just experimentation – an experiment being a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses – but also asking questions and making observations that lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed in a large number of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to run even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled the DNA in phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeled phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the specific part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people in cars leave their small towns on the outskirts and head to their workplaces, passing those who are going to work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected and supportive, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this high-carbon emission economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges falling apart.
Why are transport systems causing so many complaints, why are they failing on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave quite consistently. Therefore, traffic flow has a kind of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, connections have been established between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them more easily avoid enemies and more effectively search for food and mates.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their bodies.
It provides them with a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that today cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
More than a thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but the majority believed the opposite claim – that the Solar System, including the Sun (even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
It sounds reasonable, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and simultaneously the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is simultaneously the widest river on Earth, in some places it is up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from a thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical perfection of construction.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt marvelled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
Italian is both a daily language spoken by the majority of employees in that country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily extracted using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also had a theory that they changed into new substances and formed what we see.
Alloys are fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain non-metallic elements in small quantities, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many after it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer writing methods, the pen has fallen into a lower status and is used less often.
People now write messages on computers and never have to buy pencil sharpeners.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer appears.
A fission bomb operates on a principle that involves energy being required to assemble a nucleus with a multitude of protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Re-splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas, and thicker under the mountains.
On the closer side, there might be more lava because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates people’s behavior or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have outgrown as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want to do what they do and what in their environment will motivate them to perform, or not perform, certain actions.
Two popular theories of satisfaction are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain “one of the guys” (or girls).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating staff, assigning tasks, and holding employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything that team did and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately the one who bears responsibility for both the success and the failure of the team.
Such behavior often results in disagreement between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as a point of contact for their physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than other team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The 'Invisible Team' is a management team to which every member is accountable. This team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through a process that requires time to establish a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization’s functional departments, creativity and brilliance can emerge.
As a result, the process of organization in which collaboration occurs to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process for fulfilling client needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the scope of research and make it considerably more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in individual mental functions.
Advances in new technologies allow us to observe and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a large amount of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction context, it represents a highly significant branch of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and prioritization, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are frequently used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are also integrated into several home computer applications and video games.
Field trips are a significant part of every class. The teacher often wished she could take her students to places that weren't accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
A virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website changes every year, but older versions are kept online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Considering students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Additionally, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to cater to audience interests inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend the learning process beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “can encourage students to begin thinking more analytically and critically. By actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others are writing and can express their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).”
The city of Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada that houses a multitude of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls are located further south, while the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and other areas lies to the north.
All of this and much more highlights Ontario as what outsiders consider essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some represent almost uninhabited wilderness.
Here's a surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean along the right coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and represents a continent unto itself when it comes to wilderness.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are connected with France and are known as luxury resorts with beaches.
Arabs also brought Islam to those countries, which particularly took root on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonial conquest began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area to the north surrounds the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female passengers state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It might help if you’re wearing a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to things they might consider harassment, and it’s not uncommon for them to be followed, have their hand grabbed, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don’t be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, that is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a fisherman from the Berber tribe in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake that occurred in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Bajja, and the Spanish traders who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of magic charms, but it’s all made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east of the country, near Rwanda.
Goma was destroyed in 2002 by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
This city is also a starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and offers one of the most affordable Mountain Gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short ride is approximately 500 Congolese francs.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” began to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is a deprived city, although due to its reputation it is a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world cultural sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main locations during PBS’s special “Wonder of the African World” hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park spans 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports diverse wildlife.
It represents one of the basic attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading South African national park (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It might be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows access to some parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and represents a place that many tourists consider a main point of visit.
The parade of buildings that form the silhouette of Hong Kong is linked to a dazzling graphic visible thanks to the presence of Victoria Harbour’s waters.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon harbor on the other side.
The majority of the urban part of Hong Kong Island is densely situated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place that British colonizers took for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, you can start here.
Sundarbans is the largest tidally-influenced mangrove forest in the world, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just saline swamps – they include some of the last remaining powerful jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km², of which almost one-third of the surface is covered by aquatic/marshy areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 spotted deer currently live in this area.
Buses depart from the bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxi rides are a quick and easy way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyjapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise 83 meters in height, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The height of the free passage under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous community that lived in the area of present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was founded in the 16th century following the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous native groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best teams and players in the world of polo.
In December, the largest annual tournament is held on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here, and at any other time of year, small tournaments and matches can be followed.
For news about tournaments and locations where you can buy tickets for matches, please check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is valued at par with the British pound (GBP).
On the islands, money can be exchanged at the only bank located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands, and in the town of Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, although British currency and US currency may be; check with owners in advance regarding acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency off the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Considering that Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there occurs during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but due to a combination of wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer shows.
There aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to encounters with people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities require you to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Despite appearing as docile animals, bison, moose, musk oxen, bears, and almost all large animals can be aggressive.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don’t maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous. So, give them space.
Additionally, don't forget that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant food items and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
Luka was the location of the infamous maritime deadlock of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the murder of paramount chief Tupua Tamasesea Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland borders two harbors. The most well-known beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch along Long Bay to the north and to Devonport to the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and a large number are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upper suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops stretching along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Broj 1", and it’s not a complex beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be drunk, but New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better for travel.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are worried, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a “flat white” coffee is foreign. A short black is an “espresso”, a lot of cream (not foam) is put on a cappuccino, and tea is drunk without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Trips to the ridge are organized throughout the year, and injuries on the ridge are rare.
However, please listen to the advice given by the authorities, respect all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of the town of 1770. They can occasionally be observed outside of this period as well.
Sharks exist, however they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live permanently in the ocean. Their primary habitat is the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler, knowing they will have accommodation upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can see that it’s possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the agency.
Tourist agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of flights and hotel accommodation.
They can hold your reservation if you’d like to consider the offer or gather other documents needed for travel to that destination (e.g., a visa).
All changes or requests should first be submitted to the travel agency, and not directly to the hotel.
When it comes to festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to secure a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that although the musical program on the main stages has ended, music may still be playing at some parts of the festival late into the night.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin position as passage through the ice causes terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into maximizing the money and time guests spend. They typically have no windows or clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
They generally have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay on the premises.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served on the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all experienced gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and it is not possible to drive as you would on dry asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall very quickly to get you stuck.
Visibility may be limited by falling snow or blizzard conditions or condensation or ice forming on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal occurrences in many countries and traffic generally continues to flow without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the best tourist experience in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in common usage refers to a journey by land to view the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach close to cars, and standard equipment will give you a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better if you look through binoculars.
A safari walk (also known as "bushwalking", "safari hiking", or simply "hiking") consists of walking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some sporting events will also be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it previously hosted them in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most cancellation policies caused by the coronavirus will not be extended past July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, while the price of standard tickets will be around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can speed up their drying. In many hotels it is possible to borrow an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron isn't available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various ways to purify water, some are more effective depending on the specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they have not seen in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case an allergic reaction, spread poison, or transmit infectious diseases.
The same infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are usually not classified as pests.
Shopping in tax-free stores is an opportunity to purchase products that are exempt from taxes and excise duties at specific locations.
Travellers going to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike, as the road often passes through isolated, wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay focused: the road is dominated by steep terrain, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence is even more important than usual.
It's interesting that the mobile phone reception here is much stronger than on numerous other sections of the route, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are particularly rich and diverse, similar to those made by their southern neighbors, the Austrians.
Fruit pastries are common – apples are baked in pastry throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try the pastry which, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. Coconut milk is often used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines present throughout the nation.
However, if used without additional qualifiers, the term usually refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, features a range of simply seasoned dishes. The dominant flavors that Javanese people enjoy are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety issues as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot remains in the stirrup, the horse could drag them if it bolts. To minimize the risk, many safety precautions can be taken as a precaution.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a flat, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, saddles, especially English saddles, have safety releases that allow the stirrups to detach from the saddle if the rider pulls on them during a fall.
In the Cochamó Valley – a top climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America – there are various granite big walls and cracks.
Climbs include breathtaking views from the summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes through its endless wall potential.
Snow sports involving descending slopes, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one descends a snow-covered terrain on skis or a board attached to their feet.
Skiing is the main tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes known as “ski fanatics,” who plan entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – images from caves depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but usually doesn't include them, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski slope as a trail similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking, but you will rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through the visa application process and passport control multiple times.
However, the Schengen area, in that regard, functions as a single country.
As long as you are in this zone, you can cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen system member country, which saves time, money, and reduces paperwork.
There is no universal definition for determining which items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than comparable mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, raising reindeer primarily as draught animals.
Today, many members of the Sámi people are engaged in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the area where the Sámi live.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani populations, the word "Cigan" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and an inaccurate perception of Roma people.
If the country you plan to visit becomes subject to travel warnings, it may affect your travel insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You can consult and consider advice from governments that are not your own, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
One example is the fact that American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice represents merely a summary of the political situation in a particular country.
The expressed opinions are often brief, general, and simplified in comparison to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Adverse weather events can occur anywhere in the world. These events can be of various types, which may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Storms, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of inclement weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, showers, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of any risk to which bad weather poses to their area, as inclement weather can affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should have professional training.
By searching the internet for "Hostile Environment Course" you will likely find the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, often with practical experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but few publications address the topic of war zones.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid return travel documents.
There is inconsistent willingness among governments to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or documents updated to reflect a person’s preferred name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to act in accordance with these documents also varies greatly.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the period following September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through a scanner and maintain their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are returning flows of waves crashing on the shore, often a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow is concentrated in several deeper areas, and rapid currents towards the deep water can occur there.
Most fatalities occur due to exhaustion that sets in when a swimmer tries to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you break free from the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere you won’t be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock comes before culture shock (there’s less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding because they knew travelers needed to adjust to a new country.
People may not expect that both patience and understanding are necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light effects of the pyramids are some of the most interesting things in the children's section.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can also see them in the silence before the performance begins.
You usually always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a book of tales.
The sphinx is set in the background and tells a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they host the highest number of bases, with as many as sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with a settlement called Villa Las Estrellas.
The other islands include Livingston and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau, then rise again into the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountains in Antarctica are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range, called the Vinson Massif, whose peak, Mount Vinson, is 4892 m high.
In remote areas not covered by a mobile network, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones generally don't serve as a replacement for mobile phones because you have to make calls outdoors, with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is frequently used in cargo shipping, including recreational vessels, as well as in expeditions that require data exchange and remote voice messaging.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
It's an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year of travel and learning.
This is very popular with high school graduates, as it allows them to take a gap year before starting university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a year out to study abroad can actually improve your chances of transferring to higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees are usually charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands on its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht on archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are truly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The activity level is almost the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands that figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historical city for a few days, and return to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore during the boat trip, you won't need a special visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s no different from personal fears and dislikes towards other things that many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help some people overcome fear based on the unknown and lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for the rapid delivery of goods. Time is often critical for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
For some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes, even smaller firms have faced problems.
If items are shipped by air, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way the frying pans could get through was to send them as checked baggage. Airline regulations don’t allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
An obvious way to travel in first or business class is to open your wallet and spend a lot of money for that privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: generally, you can expect to pay up to four times more for business class than the regular economy class fare, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in even asking for discounts on business or first class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
Chișinău is the capital of Moldova. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is used in many places.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
That conflict in 1994 resulted in the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has a government and currency but has not received recognition from any UN member state.
Economic ties have been established between these two parts of Moldova despite unsuccessful political negotiations.
The most widespread religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with nearly 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
It used to be the ancient city of Smyrna, but now it is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are adorned with traditional roofs of red tiles, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although this city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík, there is a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and the village is home to an unusual octagonal church.
Above some graves in the churchyard, there are interesting marble dove sculptures.
It was worth taking a half-hour walk through the intriguing village.
North of and near the city lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron recorded a brilliant depiction of its splendor.
The Scotturb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra and stops in Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the grand shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (the shrine), a site of Marian apparitions known throughout the world.
Do not forget that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, as well as a place that holds immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their time here, and many more whose loved ones were killed here or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, formality, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place by making or carving graffiti on buildings.
In Barcelona, Catalan and Spanish are official languages. Almost half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signage is only in Catalan, as it is the first official language according to law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for their reputation of being self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is still to behave politely, like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-bred). This will make getting around much easier.
The superficiality of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show basic kindness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is situated in large forests, mainly beech, fir and spruce, and boasts a blend of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to the range of microclimates, diverse soil, and varying altitudes, it boasts a very wide selection of plant communities.
This area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
There you can find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and black grouse, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knee and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries give headscarves to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, you’ll receive a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers below the knee.
You can also borrow these at the entrance, but the clothing isn't washed after every use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli – bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and all available seasonings and toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word "Sie" for "you," are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This can undoubtedly facilitate reading, although writing is somewhat more complex due to the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominal form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
One needs to pay attention to the letters "c" and "g" because their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows.
Also, make an effort to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently – caro means dear, while carro means armored vehicle.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly straightforward grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that you will find it easier to learn Portuguese if you speak another Romance language.
However, people with little knowledge of Spanish may carelessly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and are maintained as museums, or places for education.
Considering that mild pollution at its peak wasn't a problem like it is today, they are usually found in cities or campuses and are simpler to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are massive structures located in remote places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
That concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
The emperor organized the first blossom-viewing party of the cherry trees in Japan exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy gathered around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally organized garden, you will also be ejected without discussion for collecting “samples.”
Singapore is generally an exceptionally safe place to stay, easy to get around in, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
However, if you are in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to endure both heat (always) and strong sun (less often when the sky is clear).
Several buses are heading north towards Hebron, a traditional site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Check if the bus you plan to travel on also goes to Hebron, and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to plan a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the day of Jesus' birth.
Many traditions associated with holidays have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition that on Easter night people don’t sleep and watch the sunrise from some open place.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches hold Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and members of the congregation begin celebrating precisely at midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals failed to reach the island, which made the giant tortoise the main herbivore on the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have also arrived, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark for 24 hours.
Light pollution often isn't a problem because areas are sparsely populated and you’ll be able to enjoy the view of the stars.
Japanese work culture is based on hierarchy and formality more than Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and employees address each other by last name or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial because it emphasizes group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain approval from their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors’ instructions without question.
