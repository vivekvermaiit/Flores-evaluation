However, based on standard Dyula vocabulary and grammar, here's the best possible translation, acknowledging the potential for slight inaccuracies due to the unusual terms: **"If you don't understand the writing well, that's why the transcription isn't clear."** **Explanation of key parts:** * **A tchekagni wa abesse:** If you don't understand... * **donguirila fonnonila:** the writing well ( *donguirila* = writing, *fonnonila* = well, thoroughly) * **aka ofô:** that's why / because of that. * **kounafolidilaw:** (Potentially a mispelling of *ka nafolila* meaning "it is not clear/understandable") - relating to the clarity. * **gnanan ola djongonye:** the transcription ( *gnanan* = transcription, *ola* = of, *djongonye* = it). * **transcription gnoumanna:** further emphasizes "transcription" but appears redundant/possibly a misspelling.

This is a difficult sentence with layered meaning and cultural context! Here's a translation aiming for accuracy and capturing the nuance, along with explanation of choices made: **English Translation:** He went to the market and bought a beautiful cloth, but it wasn't enough for his wife, so he was very worried and sad (and he didn't have any more money left). **Explanation of Choices & Breakdown:** * **"Ni I bi taga jidawolo la"**: "He went to the market." "Ni" marks the subject, "I" is "he/she," "bi" indicates past tense action, "taga" means "to go," "jidawolo" is "market." "la" is a definite article, similar to "the." * **"djikankourounkônôn yaala fè"**: “bought a beautiful cloth.” "djikankourounkônôn" describes a beautiful, high-quality cloth. "yaala" means "to buy." "fè" indicates the object being bought. * **"I mako té nan kè danfara wisa la"**: “it wasn't enough for his wife, so he was very worried and sad.” This is the most complex part. "I" refers back to the cloth, "mako" means "wife", "té nan" signifies insufficiency ("it wasn't enough"), “kè” means “to worry”, “danfara” means “sad” and “wisa la” emphasizes the intensity ("very/a lot"). * **"(ina fô san baa fila ni kônônton)"**: “(and he didn’t have any more money left).” "ina" is "and", "fô" means “to lack/not have”, “san” means “money”, “baa” indicates quantity, “fila” means “to finish/be used up”, and “ni kônônton” means "completely/entirely." It's important to understand that Dyula often relies on context and implication. This translation attempts to convey not just the literal words but also the underlying emotional weight of the situation.
