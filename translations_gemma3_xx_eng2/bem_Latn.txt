The Bemba people are known to come from a country where they sing songs of devotion to defeat bad spirits called bhajans, and songs of praise, especially to Shri Shyam.

Yesterday, Lakha Singh led us in singing hymns.
Offering 108 items to Chhappan Bhog (in Hinduism, these are 56 types of food offerings, including sweets, fruits, vegetables, grains, and items specifically consecrated to God) was presented to Baba Shyam.
This appears to be a mix of Bemba and potentially other languages (likely Hindi/Punjabi given "Lakkha Singh" and terms like "chhappan bhog"). A direct, accurate translation is difficult without knowing the full context and the intended meaning of the non-Bemba parts. However, focusing on the Bemba portions, here's the best possible translation, acknowledging the likely mixed nature of the original: **He/She (Lakkha Singh) did not accept the fifty-six offerings/prayers/devotional food. Also, Raju Khandelwal was informed/told.** **Explanation of Bemba parts:** * **Lakkha Singh nao alisapeela:** Lakkha Singh did not accept/refuse. ("nao" is a negative marker, "alisapeela" means refused/did not accept). * **chhappan bhog bhajan:** This part is likely from another language (Hindi/Punjabi). "Chhappan bhog" refers to a specific offering of 56 foods. “Bhajan” refers to devotional song/prayer. It’s likely being used here to describe a devotional offering or ritual. * **emba:** Also/Furthermore/In addition. * **Raju Khandelwal ewamwafwilisheko:** Raju Khandelwal was informed/told. ("ewamwafwilisheko" means was informed/told).

This translation is complex and relies on understanding cultural context and potentially specialized terminology. Here's the most accurate translation I can provide, acknowledging some nuance may be lost without further context: It is said that filmmakers are now using digital effects to create illusions by skillfully manipulating this deceptive image in editing. **Explanation of choices and potential variations:** * **"Ici cikalenga"**: This refers to filmmaking or the art of creating images/illusions. "It is said" captures the introductory nature. * **"ukuti abaleyangala amangalo"**: "That filmmakers are using effects/tricks." *Amangalo* can refer to both real and fabricated things, here implying effects. * **"bakalepindulula imyendele ya mangalo ya vidyo"**: "are manipulating digital/video effects". *Imyendele* meaning manipulation or editing. *Vidyo* is video. * **"ukupitila mukwensha ici cibombelo"**: "through skillfully/deceptively using this image". *Kwensha* conveys skill but also a degree of trickery/deception. *Cibombelo* is an image. * **"mu mwela"**: "in editing/post-production". *Mwela* often implies a process or transformation, here linked to the final shaping of the film.
