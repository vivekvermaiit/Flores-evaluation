Schneider reportedly shared a video link from a USAF base on his land.
I love Wednesday’s event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championship.
The one who is a champion is Slalom, but he still has a weakness – a lack of endurance during the final stretch. 36 out of 116 racers finished with the same lap time in that race.
Her other race, Giant Slalom, was completed in tenth place in the youth group with a combined time of 4.41.30, 2.11.60 minutes slower than the previous day’s best time from Austria’s Claudia Loesch and 1.09.02 minutes slower than the best time for second place from Hungary’s Gyöngyi Dani.
Unfortunately, only one skier was able to finish the race, and 45 out of 117 skiers who started in the Giant Slalom did not manage to complete it and were eliminated.

Martelly swore in the Independent Election Commission (IEC) and several new members.
This is a message from CEP to Mr. Martelly regarding the possibility of a meeting.
The issue that has reached the presidential commission is recommending the resignation of three CEP members as part of a package of efforts for national development and a newly elected government.
That commission is Martelly's way to protect against the regime that expanded and was demonstrated in October.

Philippine police are investigating how they smuggled motorcycles from Manila, Philippines, to be dropped off in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza was shot dead with his M16 rifle.
It's difficult to provide a *perfect* translation without context, as Acehnese can be highly nuanced. However, here's a close and likely accurate translation: “It’s better to lose a small amount that falls to safety than to lose a large amount that ends in death today.” (Essentially, it's a proverb about prioritizing safety and accepting small losses over risking everything for a potentially greater gain.)
That book is very thick, containing stories for children and adults, was quickly finished, said the Filipino photographer.
That fellow is a skilled photographer who really likes to photograph old women when they are about to go to Mecca. Mendoza was shot and killed.

From a survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, those who supported Australia becoming a republic were 8 percent, increasing from 2008.
Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced during the 2010 federal election campaign that if re-elected, Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of the crew who participated in the poll share this view, believing Queen Elizabeth II was the last Queen of Australia.
According to the latest poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic, while 31 percent believe Australia should not become a republic.

There’s no transport more suitable than a chariot on land to get to Wembley, and motorcycle parking facilities – even motorcycle-and-car parking – are nowhere to be found on the ground.
The feeling of helplessness regarding the limited transportation options increases the possibility that the competition will be forced to proceed without proper organization and without team support.
A study recently published on Friday in the journal Science revealed the discovery of a new species of ant in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have found that a new species can evolve in just two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
It’s good to talk about all sorts of things. It’s good to reminisce about past events.
Previously, it was used for weaving, which was owned and cherished. Now it is used as a mat or rolled up as a pillow.
It is made of gold, and is decorated with other metals. It is made of gold and is often used to wrap pages that are illuminated with pictures and writing in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is a test for pH with chemicals. You made an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on whether it's in acidic or alkaline (basic) chemicals.
The pH level is determined by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen is a proton whose electrons orbit (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
The morning dew is still there with the leaves, and the blue smoke rising, it seems like it’s going to rain.
If you smell something burning, it will react with the outside air, which will taste delicious and be enjoyed with the shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro were well-planned with streets and houses, equipped with a sophisticated drainage system.
Intricate drainage systems were discovered in the houses of the cities of Knossos in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Initially, writing originated in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. During the Roman civilization, writing was commonly used as a means of communication between people and for recording events.
When you get a phone call from someone who’s far away, you’re using a satellite.
Satellites in outer space are constantly receiving and responding to calls, quickly.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and our vision.
Rocket debris was detected with radar along with more than 100 pieces of shrapnel for tracking satellites or telescopes in space.
It’s important to change the world in a good way. What is most often done to help us is to provide us with better and more comfortable transportation.
It’s customary for us to ride motorcycles, cars, and other modes of transportation.
In the past, there was a beautiful girl who was sought after by many boys, but she was stubborn and didn’t care about handsome or wealthy suitors.
Actually, it’s eggplant relish, made with roasted eggplant (or sometimes preserved eggplant) that’s been seasoned with chili peppers, shallots, garlic, and long beans.
The reason for our success is a niche concept, a unique work that each individual possesses and distinguishes them from others.
Lions are very social animals, living in large groups that are called prides.
Previously, there was a male tiger who was strong and resilient, along with a female tiger and her cubs.
It is necessary to strengthen ties with all relatives, both for the extended family and for one's own siblings and children.
The lion prides themselves as if they were a group of friends, foxes, or dogs, however, those who are truly brave are different from lions (but not other animals) in the world, and that is the danger inherent in their strength.
Every athlete with extensive knowledge, although sometimes (luckily not often), falls, gets up, leaps far and is pulled by the strength of a capable human being.
Previously, the group (Genus Panthera) included lions, leopards, and jaguars. Currently, each of them is a species that walks.
It’s not a feeling of fullness like when a lion has eaten its fill, but more like the restless, clicking sound of beetles.
The ocelot is very happy to be visiting the garden. The ocelot will likely be restless, sad, annoyed and grumpy if it’s hungry. Many visitors who photograph the ocelot enjoy taking pictures of its claws.
Scientists believe that the small ocelot is being treated and cared for to be recovered (healed), and efforts are being made to find where that animal is located on the land.
That person is good at distinguishing between dry and wet, and also skilled at recognizing things in the dark and with night vision, and is also clever at sensing things that are hidden. The ocelot was caught using a trap and its skin was then dried.
When a group of tubers reproduces (population of tubers) and spreads from its original population (like if that population moves to the mountains or rivers, or if that population moves to a new island so that it is no longer able to breed), that population will eventually become different from its ancestors, evolving into a distinct form.
This new species has resources that compete with existing species, so new populations will evolve traits or adaptations that compete to survive against the pressures from those existing species, just as they evolved previously.
The aseuli population doesn't change much, and that's why they are constantly adapting like they always have.
Over time, the population began to adapt to our new Silingka, and they started behaving differently from other populations.
Sometimes, it spreads or even reaches thousands of villages, altering the population so much that there is no longer a breeding population of the same species.
I understand this process, which means a new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be separated from the important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is inhaled by humans, and plants consume carbon dioxide that is exhaled by humans (that is, they are symbiotic).
Plants obtain food from sunlight and photosynthesis. Plants also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make fire from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, there would be no life.
Mosasaurus is a top predator of its time, so it doesn’t need to be afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Their jaws, which are long, are equipped with more than 70 sharp, razor-like teeth, plus an additional set at the base of their heads, which indicates there is no escape route for any prey that passes through their path.
It’s certainly true that a turtle’s shell is hard, but perhaps its tongue is forked. Its instincts are like a turtle’s, its bones are numerous, like other mosasaurs, and perhaps even that creature is cannibalistic.
Now it’s clear why there are so many black spots inside; even giant dinosaurs like T.rex left their footprints there.
Venus tells them to come to us, Romans who are used to strange or unusual feasts, it smells of strong perfume, fragrant, cool, and various delicacies are being prepared which are very tempting.
The others, the adults and children, were allowed to sit on chairs, people like him were given priority to all of them and were treated with respect and honored.
The Roman Empire was not black, but white, stemming from Europe, not from America or Asia in the past centuries.
Honestly, that person doesn’t have any money at all, or tomatoes, or long beans, or chocolate, and doesn’t have any Romans—it’s as if they’ve only ever tasted turkey.
The people of Babylon were deceived by God into building a tall tower that was considered a house of God.
People who commit adultery are deserving of the qisas punishment according to religious law and the bodies of the perpetrators are washed, shrouded, and then executed by God’s decree during ceremonies and feasts.
Little by little, the forest was cleared, and after that, a forest emerged from that forest that was suitable for being protected by religious figures.
The old tower resembling a pyramid, which is called a ziggurat, was moved today as a beautiful item from a temple.
The top of the tower is a place to relax for visitors.

The Hebrew family returned home safely.
That person is good at weaving; that’s why there’s always a demand for his/her cloth. Bamboo is useful for building houses.
There was once a beautiful maiden in the land of Canaan, and she became a source of longing.
Greenland got its name from being very icy. According to Norse stories, they say that Erik the Red came from Iceland because of a feud, and when he went far west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
After that happened, the Eskimo people were said to have disappeared at that time.
That region is known as ‘Scandinavia’, which is different from people, kings, customs and stories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
Last night I watched the movie National Treasure, and it made me think about perhaps being able to find hidden treasures like the ones mentioned in the Declaration of Independence.
It’s chaotic, there’s nothing right. Whoever is crying about what was written in that newspaper, they are all just stirring up trouble.
That writing in the Information of Independence is, “The Declaration of Independence of the United States on the 4th of July 1776.” From that, it is taken and returned to the information itself.
Because there is no one who understands with the writing like that, that understanding is the beginning of their life, there is a small piece of important information (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) that is rolled up for change.
With that, that might be a way to understand it.
After the war and the clashes that followed, all of France was occupied, but only a little was destroyed.
That was the order of the French "Vichy" government. Those French people were allied with the Germans from 1940 and were also with the rebels, so they fought alongside them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces landed in France with the intention, which was named “Operation Dragoon”.
Two weeks after America and France declared independence, France began to retaliate against Germany.
A civilization is a culture that originates from a group of living people who are inherited and passed down through generations, a society.
That term 'peradaban' comes from the Latin civilis, which means civilian, related to Latin 'civis' which means citizen, and 'civitas' which means city or state, and that is often interpreted as a measure of society.
The region is what is known as the land of lands. This culture and civilization have been passed down for various eras, a cultural treasure that is unmatched and precious with tradition.
The culture that exists is a great treasure with the signs of history that exist, and cannot be forgotten as a civilization that is worthy.
Following the Revolutionary War, the region was part of that which was established by the central government in conjunction with Congress as one of the components forming the Confederation Budget.
The congress discussed the issue of implementing taxes, and, because there is no national executive or judicial branch, it referred to the regional authority, which reportedly wasn't cooperative, halting all work.
That is why it is important to immediately establish tax laws and regulations from regional governments.
The stories of Pasai are often told about a time when regions felt they could change and regions were considered inferior by the central government until today, and it seems there is no end to it.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are considered the two most successful teams in the world, and they are the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Sports that are popular include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, athletics, rugby, tennis, hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Cycling is the most popular sport in the North region, and Italians compete in international tours and the Olympic Games.
Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the country with the 7th largest number of islands in the world!
Because of the cluster/group from the island of Japan, Japan is said, in terms of geographical position, to be an "archipelago".
Taiwan was first known in the 15th century when European sailors arrived and named that island Ilha Formosa, or the Island of Beautiful Appearance.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, and from there began a transformation by harvesting various timbers and employing Chinese laborers for construction on the plains and for shipbuilding.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern parts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province under Qing government rule in 1885.
In 1895, immediately after the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and which governed until 1945.
That Machu Picchu has many buildings, such as Intihuatana, the Sun Temple, and the Three Windows Temple.
They are building a house that is intended for two families and hopefully will become a beautiful view, especially this building which is currently being constructed.
In 1976, a person from Machu Picchu was said to have come and this cold and damp weather really makes one feel lazy until today.
Actually, he prefers using a 35mm lens for photos, and that’s the film he most often uses, which is typical of the analog film era.
This is about focusing on the quality of images, but more importantly, the aspect ratio that needs to be considered when using a digital camera's image sensor.
That 35mm one is already suitable, the one that’s intended, 36mm for wide shots and 24mm for portraits.
The aspect ratio of this screen (which is commonly used for most television ratios) is typically 3:2.
That kind of format (APS family format, for example) is better or more suitable for its aspect ratio.
The most common belief in the past and the most common belief now regarding dreams is a regular occurrence for people to experience and a sign of things that will happen, often appearing in a veiled manner.
This is said to be the most suitable place for women who are pregnant to rest, which is at the intersection due to the shade from the large trees that divide the road and the small trees that are tall and wide (it’s very comfortable).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
Previously, it spread from the teachings of the Christian religion and then conquered all European countries, and also differed in language and customs. It is said.
The widespread news quickly influenced everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth is often associated with suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary resources are specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years with the concentration of power and with this it became people who were separated and this was fulfilled.
There wasn’t a ship at all nearby, the British soldiers were preparing to send troops by sea to the German people.
That plan is truly for enjoyment, it is agreed upon by the military and the public, and it seems it will clash with international law which is universally understood and with the agreement of two strong powers that are currently being investigated.
The British often patrol the sea to prevent ships from entering areas where there are dangers, and that can be a cause of accidents for ordinary ships.
Because of this phone call, which has a connection to this plan, the German man was offered a plan that is effective every time a ship comes during wartime for the person who provides [information/support].
In the 1920s, the most prominent aspiration of the people and nations was to choose peace and live a prosperous life.
Oh, how heartbreaking the sights were, so cruel and terrifying from war during the First World War, nations that were seen to be striving for prosperity like that in those times.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America and worked briefly as an assistant at Edison's factory in New York City.
He came to America with 4 cents on him, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (who was his manager from the beginning) to Thomas Edison.
China in the past had a unique way of governance that distinguished it; each period from China or each family in power was within a long series of separate dynasties.
The fall of that dynasty marked a period of chaos and fragmentation across regions. What is most notable about this period is the era of the Lhee Boh Kingdom, which lasted around 60 years, overlapping with the Han and Jin Dynasties.
This is the time when many people are coming and going, all gathering to see the place where the king sits.
The Lhee Boh Keurajen dynasty was a very bloody period in Chinese history, reportedly costing the lives of hundreds of millions of people just to secure burial plots in the most luxurious burial sites in the imperial capital of Xi’an.
This is a result of social and political conditions like those experienced, changing the way from a traditional method to a definitive republic, a feeling of nationalism and loyalty to a prosperous nation where society and a single person with power are united.
Indeed, this revolution will definitely bring benefits to those who are patient and steadfast in their faith, creating a hole for those who are impatient, and the most patient will ultimately be more successful and more prosperous than before.
The soldier was dismissed from military service because he was caught gambling; he was also dismissed from his position because of excessive drinking.
That French Revolution was certainly an inspiration for many people to then live with the idea of making a revolution themselves in other countries.
Muhammad, who was deeply saddened, then left his friends and the ordinary life he knew. He stayed in a cave, specifically the cave called “Hira” on Mount “Nur” (light), as a place of seclusion.
He was created from clay, what he will become is towards the Day of Judgement, and truly what has come is for Muhammad, accepted by the Spirit and the Soul.
The story goes that a dove flew from the mountains in the northern region of Mecca, and that cave was separated from the outside world.
Indeed, it’s not easy for someone like me to describe that person who is always hiding in that cave, this cave feels like it’s separating [us/things].
There isn’t a single visible dewdrop other than the clear sky, already above and around the winding mountains. Find the fragrant smoke that rises and shines from within this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still exist today.
Built by the ancient Egyptians in the centuries BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the oldest pyramids built as a tomb for the Pharaohs who had died.
The Land of Manyang Giza, or "Lampoh Jeurat Giza" in Panton Mate Ureueng, has several pyramids (those large pyramids are the largest), several mounds of earth, several sacred places, and a large Sphinx.
That great pyramid was built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu, and like other pyramids that are larger, more beautiful, and sacred places built as tombs for Pharaoh Khufu and members of his royal family.
The sign for "up arrow" is like a V and the sign for "down arrow" is like a thick plank or block made of wood.
He was skilled at aiming arrows at the tip and the stem with his bow, and also skilled at aiming arrows at the target (the place where he practices archery) and at taking aim.
The old arrows were usually made simply, but new arrows are stronger and more accurate.
It's true I went to see the sign earlier, but remembering that bent sign is ugly because of the music, that body is usually easily hit/struck.
King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, along with their two children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 7 years old) and the King’s sister, Princess Elizabeth, were forced to leave Paris for Versailles by a large crowd of people on October 6, 1789.
Once upon a time, they went to Paris to join a group of people who were plotting and conspiring to threaten the King and Queen.
Their friend was forced by the King and Queen to close the window quickly.
On a certain day, a large group of people were said to have seen the head of a fruit child of the kingdom who was being sought at Versailles by the Queen herself.
They called the American Imperialist War the Philippine War, and that war made the Philippines strong.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to fund the destruction of forests and flowers as stipulated in a letter from the Philippine government, which ruined the homes of Wall Street bankers.
That woman, the profit from the alcohol that was sold was quickly exploited for the benefit of Filipino people, and is actually the desire of American Imperialism.
For us Templars, frankly speaking, it’s better to die fighting than to surrender and become a lesson/example for others.
Generally, that event is considered as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Late Middle Ages were influenced by trade in the Late Middle Ages and also by the Late Middle Ages Akhir, which followed the conventions of European fashion around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing various ideas in practice, from technological drive or technological necessity to the strict belief that humans are driven by fundamental logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Much of the interpretation of technological determinism is divided into two common ideas: first, that the development of this technology follows a path largely outside of cultural or political influence, and second, that technology in turn has “effects” on society that are socially embedded.
For example, people say that motorized vehicles certainly contribute to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is only economically viable for a few motorcycles, so a new production method is being considered to reduce motorcycle costs.
Mass motorcycle ownership is a major cause of increased road accident incidents, leading to the need for new technical expertise in healthcare for treating severe injuries.
Romanticism is a strong influence against cultural determinism, which was championed by figures like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography became a significant concern, and attention was given to customs and cultures connected to that geography, and through this, gatherings and populated places were more powerful than strict, imposed laws that were often harsh.
Because Paris is considered a major global contemporary fashion capital, Constantinople was considered a European feudal fashion capital.
That place was a center of luxury starting around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
Their status was raised only in the second century, primarily because of the fact that the Salé people used to trade with gifts like silk and spices worth more than what was offered in the Byzantine market.
That water is said to have transferred the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style developed between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
That book discusses the influence of Byzantine culture in history.
Wheat, once it's ripe and ready, usually lasts about 25 to 30 years when stored properly.
The black death struck Central and Western Europe, spreading by them. One of the advancements of that time was because people used sharp tips to sew clothes with.
Subsistence farming is a way of life that is inherited to fulfill daily needs for those who are unable to afford other livelihoods and is important for the welfare of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple agricultural system, utilizing organic methods, which uses local seeds from ecological areas that are cultivated and maintained with crop rotation or other simple ways to collect existing resources.
Every historical lesson from farmers goes to the agricultural sector to support and nurture a prosperous nation.
Subcultures are often born from a feeling of being different, and often those people collectively develop a sense of shared sadness or pain.
Subcultures arise due to factors such as ethnicity, language, place, and/or shared group interests.
Qualities that form a subculture as something that distinguishes itself are like language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or due to various reasons.
The kayem subculture group is characterized by their group’s unique and symbolic customs, which are intended to be respected, maintained, and passed down through generations.
One of the most common ways to illustrate important social issues is by using numerous sad cat pictures – cats that are neglected, unfortunate, or deliberately abused – but not informing the public about it.
Many children like to play “hide and seek” or gambling. Many children like hide and seek (it’s common for them to do so); with many opportunities, this child doesn’t feel anything because their parents don’t scold or physically punish the child for playing.
Children may be experiencing abuse or are vulnerable children before puberty or marriage.
While others are enjoying life in the world, we are only experiencing hardship and suffering in the dense jungle.
When a child is born, it’s like a blank page for humanity; a newborn is helpless and needs to be cared for (physically and emotionally), like a seed needing nurturing to grow, like a stone or something without purpose for humans.
While continuing to support the infrastructure project to get a more convenient and better one, the implementers are going further.
Essentially, the question is how to learn quickly to help those who are new to experiencing things like learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
The French language is both virtual and real, with other sentences, one example is in the form of French but it feels like just a piece of paper used in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants help connect software and understand what is being asked, facilitating and measuring procedures that may be difficult for students to do alone.
The child was taken to the orphanage because he was very poor, having no parents, was orphaned, and his father had passed away.
There are many children who like to play with fire in that area who aren’t supervised, are reckless, and stubbornly continue to do it.
I am creating a safe and supportive system as a zone that is friendly to all children.
Our child care system aims to provide a safe home, loving care, proper education, and good healthcare.
Taking care of children is hard, especially when they are small and still need to be carried from our own house, and it requires patience and dedication.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The phenomenon differing from the Internet results in additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and gratification.
Previously, “curiosity” and “socialization” were considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Engagement” and “ongoing relationships” were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they studied participant reactions to websites.
The expert is analyzing video recordings specifically to understand subtle interpretations of micro-expressions, facial movements that occur within milliseconds.
Everyone is unique, it’s true that one person can be introverted while another is extroverted, and both express micro expressions and body language.
Oliver Sacks, that was the President’s lecture material, explaining how people who don’t understand are often mistaken about why the brain continues to be valued even now.
Indeed, he only gives guidance to show that remembering things like that in understanding is to demean humanity, making people act like livestock being herded.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic groups: random and real.
Mutation is the primary driver of genetic change, and selection occurs from observable, viable traits.
Segregation and recombination clearly show the link between two groups and each generation.
In the forest and savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to obtain sufficient amino acids from food sources in the wood that are available.
That flood, there is no escaping the consequences: postpartum depression, malnutrition, and infant mortality.
The best plant-based source of protein is found in seeds and legumes, but this is poorly digested by primates like us unless it’s been processed.
Ideally, it should be cooked (fish, shrimp, vegetables) until thoroughly done, but it still contains protein with a sufficient amount containing all essential amino acids.
Essentially, that monkey is thinking, we don’t have enough food anymore, especially when we have a "protein problem" with our bodies and the way chimpanzees habitually store food in the savanna today.
Menstruation is a process of shedding and deliberately experiencing a normal period cycle and then a period afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This is about feeling restless and unable to sleep, often because of worry or a sense of foreboding, and feeling like something bad is about to happen, leaving you feeling unsettled and unable to rest.

Tibetan Buddhism is love for the teachings given by the Buddha, but it is influenced by the arrival of Mahayana and techniques from Indian Yoga.
The core principle of Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. This is one aspect of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and a deep longing that everyone possesses.
With Yoga Kundalini, Kundalini energy (internal energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central meditation from Tibet is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing various deities and their powers, the chakras are activated and awareness, both externally and internally, is developed.
War is a cruel thing that happened during World War II, directed at the rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States. And because of war, systems, processes and cultures are destroyed, causing countries to collapse.
With two days of fighting already, the company today is at war with Prang Leupie according to reports.
This will last for 40 years, and will be fought with truth, and will spread from branches, in war zones from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland was attacked and occupied, and there was hope that a letter and agreement would be signed in the Romanian capital.
Wheat, this statement can be used as a pretext for war overnight, with more than 800,000 troops from the Red Army of the Soviet Union being mobilized and weapons produced by Belarus and Ukraine after invading eastern Poland, which violated the Riga Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international laws, can be bilateral or multilateral.
The best way to move people and goods by land and sea is by ship today.
Naval forces and traditional methods ensured that our country could provide for its people and their livelihoods, while at all times, enemy attacks aimed to deprive people of their lives and livelihoods.
One of the most recent and important topics now is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. America tried to escort people and ships across the Atlantic Ocean to help England.
At the same time, German warships, with golden prows and swift hulls, strive to overtake this eel.
The cat is playing around, Germany might be able to defeat England like that, because most of Europe is the same.
Recently, they found a treasure of 10,000 coins that were buried in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The custom and tribe used to use areca nut as a simple way to offer betel nut, areca fruit, betel leaf, and lime.
Usually, they throw away old rattan in the river or move it to another place, and often those who throw it away are children or young people, just like us who used to do it. This way of disposing of it still exists until today.
The story of the Portuguese invasion began in the early 16th century.
He remembered the path of the poem being scorched by fire, starting from the elder and those who accompanied him; that body was allowed to be a strong horse, that body was indeed capable of running faster and further than the swift deer on that day, being more agile.
The train tracks are being dismantled and removed to make way for a motorcycle parking area. People say that a parked motorcycle looks much nicer at the front of the house above it.
This is truly enjoyed by many people, but it’s a pity it’s more difficult than plucking leaves from a betel nut tree.
Formerly, men and women wore earrings and nose rings. In 1767, women stopped wearing them.
The transportation of goods these days is like with cars and motorcycles, people are selling coconuts for two million rupiah which are said to be related to the ancestors of Homo Erectus (meaning old people).
That person’s body, Australopithecus doesn’t walk upright as usual.
Bipedalism likely originated with Australopithecus between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, and perhaps Sahelanthropus even earlier, possibly as far back as seven million years ago.
If we understand our roots and where we live, we can contribute to environmental preservation, and hopefully we can all become activists who care about issues at all levels.
This is like watering plants in a pot, Beuranggandum, we don't have much strength to argue anymore, therefore we must reconcile with the plants, and we should continue to nurture them.
It is clear that this world is heading towards change due to the advancement of knowledge and technology of humankind, and even more so because of increasingly better conditions for people and the welfare of those who are poor and in need.
When the draft was being discussed at the Congress on July 4th, a copy was signed by President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, and they sent it back and forth to a printing house that wasn’t far from the location of John Dunlap.
That evening, it sold for 150 to 200 rupiah each, and this thing was famously known as the "Dunlap pamphlet".
The story of those documents was widely circulated by telephone after being handled by John Nixon as a guide to the Independence Building on July 8th.
A letter was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which was read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A ship sailed to London on August 10th.
Only 25 copies of the Dunlap pamphlet remain, and those are the oldest surviving documents. However, the phonetic records from that time did not survive.
Some paleontologists believe there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and lived until now. We probably don't know that yet.
The children who are not liked by them are like dinosaurs because they are strong and can be feared.
But that’s just a story about rice that’s full of dinosaurs.
The ant doesn't like sugar and salt and shrimp paste, a handful, and it chases with two pieces of cake like a T-Rex.
Essentially, a computer is a tool that processes desires from a method or information that is contained within a code in the form of a long string of binary numbers.
Each bit is represented by one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these bits are used as binary digits – or bits, as they are commonly called in computer terminology.
That itch in the body is really irritating. Those who experience it, often feel like vomiting, it's common for one itchy spot to be examined intensely and then scratched repeatedly.
The most common thing that causes itching all over the body is allergies to medicine or chemicals in the house.
It's a shame to help someone who is already comfortable.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in formal contexts for various insects.
This term originates from a close relationship with lice, which are known to adapt and become parasites on humans.
Fleas and lice are either killers or pests, both adapting to live in nests or build homes on their hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately over 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which is a nerve disease that affects young people and often older adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, specifically the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to contract MS compared to men.
This morning the child was very sad, or perhaps because of the child, for the sake of another child.
Currently, they are considering approving a plan to adopt that child.
If adopted, a small child who is different will also become a child who is spoiled by others and can raise that child.
The main goal of education is to develop human potential through formal and natural ways. Hopefully, this method will be smelled in further research.
That is interesting, experimentation, and an experiment is a controlled test designed to support or refute a hypothesis, often involving observation and leading to natural research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus their attention on ancient writings and, specifically, on the Latin Bible.
Our understanding is that Aristotle was the first to examine many sciences, including psychology.
When the Greeks first began, the West borrowed heavily from Greek philosophy and science.
The rhythm that occurs in physiology and life involves endogenous cycles and is used as a biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which you often hear as signals of periodic tides, are also useful for living creatures, especially for sensing time, mushrooms, fish, and crustaceans.
The biologist is an oscillator of three natural states that continues a period from happy-sad without external conditions.
Hershey and Chase proved that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase proved that, or viruses, are used to understand our DNA within cells.
That thing is able to detect two isotopes by identifying DNA fragments and phosphorus radioactive or protein fragments and radioactive sulfur.
Mutations occur for various reasons causing changes in the form of mutations, primarily due to genetic material being affected and cells, which are the basic units, being damaged.
Any change in cells that isn’t properly controlled can lead to illness, while that change in place can become a mate (partner) or cancer.
Usually, people go on vacation to refresh their minds and bodies, to enjoy the vacation spot with a peaceful atmosphere, including diving and fishing.
Protecting forests is like protecting our lives, like food, like shelter, like clean water, and like preserving sustainability and maintaining information about the ecosystem.
Some say it’s due to the weather, some due to the soil, and some because of the forest fires in Kalimantan.
That's a long sentence! Here's the translation: It's a pity, people have changed the village and motorcycles are parked in a place that used to be and passed by other people, it seems this is a new place that has been changed now.
With this dynamic transportation system, every day people travel in various ways, and furthermore, with a three-wheeled motorcycle transportation system as well.
Recently, people have been talking about how carbon economics could be destroyed by a situation that is very close to, and supported by, people from two million years ago.
Every day, people travel back and forth and use the transportation system. Many people complain about the transportation system.
Regarding a nation that progresses, that's what people often lament – losses like water that spills or scattered dew.
If the transportation system is like that good, why do we still get stuck in traffic every day? Isn't there a transportation engineer who can solve this? Or is it just wishful thinking?
Traffic rules are a science for people traveling on the roads and intersections from two points and agreed upon by all.
That's too bad, the direction of that traffic is bad because people riding motorcycles don't know how to give way properly.
Generally, intersections are where most accidents happen; therefore, traffic flow must have clear and understandable rules that can be calculated mathematically.
For clearer traffic flow, please pay attention to the following three things: (1) direction, (2) load, (3) speed.
This project helps with the planning, design, and operation of facilities along the main roads.
Usually, that means being generous and helpful; and it’s good to share food with friends who are in need.
It’s good to be cautious because a small mistake can cause a big problem for the body.
This is for my friend, a suitable place to rest for him during the fruit season.
Today, all of them were busy folding clothes.
Before the knowledge that exists today, people in the past, including Aristarchus, stated that the Sun revolves around the Earth.
The heart truly aches when a beautiful thing is destroyed and becomes worthless; Father Sun relentlessly chases after Earth, including the Moon (and all the other stars).
This is truly beautiful here by the river, because the Earth doesn't seem to be joking around, right?
The Amazon River is the longest and widest river in the world. It discharges more water than the other two widest rivers combined.
The Amazon River is the widest river in the world, and it is wide beyond measure.
Twenty piranhas with sharp teeth that live in the river are similar to those in the Amazon river.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is estimated to be even longer when including all its tributaries.
It is said that the pyramid which was built with that stone is very old, almost reaching the time of the Old Kingdom; those pyramids at Giza were not built randomly in terms of size and the sophisticated techniques used at that time during construction.
The old head village (or leader) of Meuse has been buried there, now commemorated with a monument to his body, which still feels cool despite being over a hundred years old.
The number of people living in Vatican City is more than 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
Vatican City is the official language of Italy according to law and custom.
Italian is also useful as a language for everyday matters, as well as for people who are currently working in that country, while Latin is still used in religious ceremonies.
The Pope who lives in Vatican City is a Roman Catholic.
People used to believe things about the origin of chemical substances like salt, gold, and silver, and stories from the past, which are now understood in science as natural phenomena and commonly associated with simple explanations.
Aristotle, a great philosopher, proposed the theory that everything is made of a combination of one or more basic substances. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like a recipe for making good fertilizer from compost (or layers): husk, straw, leaves, and plasma; some even have a theory that it can be used for new seeds to help growth that is economical.
The cell which is capable of dividing is a unit of life from two or more cells. Don't be surprised if those substances are arranged in a periodic table.
These things, like calcium and potassium, are often used as fertilizer. That’s how to make it, so it’s used like lime and good [for the plants].
That is a complex sentence! Here's the translation: They say that the earth is warming because of things that contain elements like carbon in large quantities.
Everything that exists in the universe is made of substance. All of that substance is made of tiny particles, namely atoms.
That word just beautifully describes how overwhelmed I feel at the end of this sentence.
With a style like this, he is a friend who is good at entertaining people when telling stories.
Those who are educated, because the new way of writing has been learned, tend to be used for social status and greater benefits.
That girl is good at using the computer, but doesn't know how to cook or plant vegetables.
That child wants to play, wants a keyboard, but it's broken and can't be fixed.
The basic idea is based on the principle that atoms consist of a core with protons and neutrons.
It’s like a wandering poem to someone with a flower. Let the core remain strong so that power is truly respected.
Heartbeat, a handful of sand, nothing important that can be held; meaning either it will break or it won't last long.
Yesterday the moon rose from the sea and the beach. Here, the moon is truly beautiful and bright.
The crack extended approximately 70 km in the eastern part and about 100 km in the western part.
The sea is getting higher and the land is getting lower.
Maybe it’s better to plant in that direction because the soil is more fertile. It’s easier to harvest from higher ground.
The theory contends that it is based on what is understood or spoken by people who are knowledgeable or experts in the field.
Stories like this remind me that people who are diligent and/or persistent in pursuing something will eventually succeed after striving throughout their lives.
Stories like this often happen in villages concerning people who are angry and what they do, and about those villages that are close by, and what they did or didn't do regarding those angry people.
The two main theories relevant to this are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two candidates were chosen when the manager began leading people who were involved in their affairs. One end of the spectrum aims to remain eligible for a religious person (or a young man).
This type of manager feels it's difficult to give guidance that isn't confusing, prioritizes discipline, conducts regular evaluations, and doesn't take responsibility or share responsibility with others.
At the other end of the spectrum, some people are constantly changing for people who don't understand, feeling uncomfortable with all that has been created, grouped and can be made into rules or laws.
You are capable, leading with full responsibility and both willing and unwilling for the group.
This issue arose as a result of friction between the leaders and members of the other team.
Virtual groups are the main standard that is the same as conventional groups, but there are differences.
Members of the virtual group serve as a point of contact for the physical group directly with them.
That person is more likely to resist autonomy from conventional group members because that group gathers according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The clear manifestation of "group cohesiveness" as defined (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is the unique component of virtual groups.
That “no group” is a management group whose members are reporters. The “no group” establishes standards for member types.
Is establishing an organization like that really worth the time to found another organization? A purpose for creating an organizational concept like that for practice is innovation.
These are the times when remembering the past is useful and can be a lesson, and getting involved in even a small part of living from within an organization, creativity and all that exists can be utilized for work.
That's a good initiative, coming from an organization working together to help those who are clever to be involved in a new innovation project for the benefit of those in need.
That organization is able to innovate; a good leader cultivates a culture of innovation every time to share knowledge and strengthen the organization.
Angel (2006) argues that there is no clear way to help organizations consolidate at a higher level of work.
That neurological data is proof that supports a theory for how the brain works. Therefore, this is being used to narrow the scope and to be more precise.
The connection stems from the hardship of thinking and acting is what helps people understand in facing his/her difficulties.
This is about understanding that headaches, trauma, wounds, and tumors can affect people and can be a cause of mental dysfunction.
With the development of technology, it helps us to surpass previous limitations and to shape thoughts and ways that were previously unimaginable.
This is what’s being discussed for us now, that is, to understand and overcome past trauma by building a model for healing that will help us when we remember and process the events that are in our minds.
That AI is really good at dreaming up science, that AI is specifically designed for computer science, which is connected to learning, and also includes a component of adaptation.
That AI is now going to be able to automatically adjust to become more useful.
Make sure to do a check-up, review schedules, and it can be used to diagnose and ask questions of the person who is complaining, such as remembering details like names or faces.
Hello, that’s just a little bit of advice for those who are confused, like a scale to weigh options when seeking answers to problems in life.
This AI system is now capable of excelling in fields like economics, medicine, science, and the military, similar to how computers were initially created for household use and video software applications evolved.
That feeling is a significant part of the past days. Perhaps that's why a teacher is enthusiastic about students going to places that aren't reached by motorcycles as a choice.
Technology offers solutions with virtual spaces. Students can experience museum artifacts, virtual aquariums, or be amazed by art that is easily accessible with that level of immersion.
Using virtual reality is a way that is good for both seeing and providing experiences with a high level [of immersion/quality].
Recently, a student from Bennet School in North Carolina created a website about that animal – the capital city’s mascot – and although the website was newly created, it’s good that it was changed online to create a clipping.
Beginners are helped to start learning, while experienced students share their blogging experiences with proper grammar and spelling, so that the general public can emulate them.
When students increasingly become critical thinkers, bloggers have begun to prioritize getting likes over writing substantial content and not being criticized.
The blog post states "to prepare students to be more familiar with the world around them." It aims to spark interest and motivate young people to learn in a fun and engaging way (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a platform that truly inspires collaboration, and encourages students to develop skills beyond the confines of traditional schooling.
Writing a blog that is suitable “can develop students to be more analytical and critical; with active engagement in responding to internet material, students can accurately represent themselves in the context of others’ perspectives, and reproduce those skills in various situations (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is Canada's capital, a beautiful city with many historical places and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Before, it was just planting rice, now it’s like Niagara Falls and everything is a natural house that’s greater than Muskoka and continues from there.
This year and onwards, Ontario is being discussed a lot because it’s said to be similar to Canada for outsiders.
The land is wide and vast, and it’s said that where people live and cultivate, it is not barren and uninhabited.
To compare populations that are often discussed by people: more African Americans live in the US than people from Canada.
The islands of East Timor are located in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Timor.
Madagascar is actually very far and a large island, it seems, in the direction where the sun sets.
Long ago, the islands were once my country of independence, or involved with the French language, a place where it was good to rest and after being tired from traveling.
Arabs originally practiced Islam on this earth, and were then spread widely to Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.

This poor fellow: it is said that every time he remembers, he always feels sad, perhaps because of his widowed status and now getting married.
This is just a reminder to return *only* the translated sentence. This is a little difficult without context, as Acehnese can be nuanced. However, a good translation is: This is only useful for tying (it seems there's nothing else to tie with).
People often say that it is fitting and proper to preserve that cultural practice because of the stories and beliefs considered beautiful, noble, and so on.
Don't bother with the small things, don't be upset about what people say (whether it's cultural norms or not, that’s just for those who understand!).
The city which is now Casablanca was first founded by Berber people in the 10th century BC, and was later controlled by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a port in a location that was once Anfa.
Portugal once and had intended to attack Casa Branca, but was prevented after an earthquake in 1755.
The King of Morocco was reportedly building that city as Daru I-Badya and it is said that Casablanca was desired by the Spanish who were conquering and reportedly wanted to build a beautiful port there.
Casablanca is one of the most beautiful cities in Morocco.

In 2002, lava from Mount Nyiragongo flowed through the streets and towards the city center.
That Goma is now safe, consistently people fleeing from outside Goma must be helped, because war is ongoing from North Kivu province.
That city is a painful memory for me, like Mount Nyiragongo volcano and also a sadness for the gorillas of Mount Gorilla who are cheap to find in Africa.
Usually, people ride motorcycles (Honda 90s) to visit Goma frequently. Locals normally charge 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Apparently, it's said that "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for faraway, lost lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a famous city, perhaps its dignity allows it to be a beautiful city for visiting, and it has an airport.

Kruger National Park (KNP) is in South Africa and shares a border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the west, and to the north is the Limpopo River.
With an area of 19,500 km² and divided into 14 administrative regions, each contributing three representatives, they all work together to improve and develop that area.
That is a lion, one of the predators from Kruger National Park, and it comes from Kruger National Park (SANParks).
With the help of Taman Nasional Afrika Tunoeng (Tunoeng Africa National Park), that’s a good place to wander and relax in that park.
That means it's possible to produce a single person who is skilled, that’s why it came from and is like a garden in Africa, specifically the chosen or all of the African National Gardens.
Hong Kong Island, which is part of the Hong Kong area, is known and considered a beautiful tourist spot and a popular center.
The shimmering lights that were previously in Hong Kong were extinguished and replaced with the bright glow of ships that had just arrived from Victoria Harbour.
To truly enjoy the view which is very beautiful in Hong Kong, departing from the Island and then going to Kowloon is quite easy.
The most valuable thing about the way the Kowloon City area of Hong Kong was built is that it was agreed upon and fully utilized on the reclaimed land, essentially a completely new foundation.
This is a place that the colonizers, the British, really liked as a place for recreation, and if you see it as a reminder of the colonial era, it is a place that is worth preserving.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, extending approximately 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. That area within India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
That story, it is said, originated from the dense forests – it is recounted passed down from forests which are high and located in the wide plains of the Ganges.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², and most of that area is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for various animals, and today it houses around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer that live within that area.
Motorbikes are prohibited from parking along the riverbank area all day, especially those heading east towards Jakarta/Bumthang, between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
The motorcycle accident in that area was very serious, and it was reported to be investigated further for several days afterward.
Those circles were drawn by the Japanese Launching Motor Bus, which was smiling and congested.
Motorbike taxis are commonly a good and affordable way to get around places in the area, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River is a river that is long and wide. It is located between the cities of Oipoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
There are two towers reaching a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters, and have two wheels with a width of 3.50 meters.
The depth of that well is 15 meters. The well was built in August 2011, and wasn't opened for people until March 2017.
That road was officially opened for operation in September 2017, specifically to facilitate the training of Brazilian soldiers after it was built.
The Guarani are a people originating from the most important group that settled in the place now known as Eastern Paraguay, living by migrating from place to place seeking the best livelihood, which was created to sustain life.
The Chaco region is home to the groups of indigenous tribes like the Guaycuru and Payagua, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
For the 16th time, Paraguay was famously known as “The Great Province Beneficial to the Indian People,” a name originating from the desire of the Spanish colonizers and the groups who came from there.
The Spanish nation has experienced a history that is tragically long and spans centuries.
Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay becoming a place for people to live and establish their identity.
That Argentina was once chosen as one of the best football teams and coaches in the world.
The sithon tournament, which is held every year, will be held in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and other events that are more or less the same can be held again in different years within a period of time.
For those interested in the polo tournament and wanting to buy tickets for the event, information can be obtained from the Argentinian Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
The thief was caught while trying to steal a can of sardines on that island, located near the FIC West store in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted for payment on the island, and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
Regarding the islands that are abundant, it’s possible the credit isn’t accepted; perhaps British and American currency that was examined—investigated thoroughly to see how the accepted payment method works.
That ship can’t go to view the Falklands Islands outside the island, so viewing that is best done from the island itself.
That Montevideo boat sounds like it’s coming from the Equator, reportedly it’s a very old boat, a historical boat in the Northern Territory of Earth and its surroundings.
Montevideo is subtropical; it’s very beautiful, the temperature is usually above +30°C.
People often feel the temperature differently than what’s shown on the thermometer; that feeling, and the feeling of the wind, is often more accurate than the reading on the thermometer.
There is a flood of “rain” and “water” every year: the amount of rainfall is approximately constant every season.
It’s important to return to the beautiful park, people, return often and don’t ever be tired of visiting or damaging it.
According to park authorities, there are approximately 100 tigers/meters from the elephants and wolves, and 25 meters from all other small animals!
There aren’t many kinds of game animals in that direction anymore, like bison, deer, and various types of deer (deer and deer, two different deer), wild boar, and all sorts of buffalo can be seen far away.
It's pitiful, truly heartbreaking to see wounds like that because that person wasn't looked after by a caring mother. Day by day, gradually, it hardens, becomes like wood, and is useful as a paddle, ultimately becoming a burden and hardship for them.
It’s very good, but remember that if someone is too enthusiastic, it can disturb others and cause other problems, so be mindful or it will be chaotic and have no place to step.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. This city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of around 40,000 people.
