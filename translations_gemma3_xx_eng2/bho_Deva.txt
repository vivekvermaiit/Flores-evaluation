This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory already well-known), but also provides information that is not usually obtained from the study of fossils, such as color and 3D shape.
Scientists said that the color of the animal’s wings was chestnut brown on top and faded or carotenoid in color underneath.
Further investigation revealed another thing – how wings developed in birds.
No rachis, a developed shaft, has been observed in dinosaur feathers, but other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – are present. Researchers believe that the development of the rachis also occurred in a later stage, like other organs.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren’t used for flight, but rather for regulating body temperature or were simply for display. Researchers say that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, looking at the sample suggests these are feathers of an ancient dinosaur, not of a baby dinosaur.
Researchers believe that although it has a small dinosaur’s tail, the sample appears to have the feathers of a crested dinosaur rather than droopy, chicken-like wings.

In France, the traditional method of voting is quite backward in terms of technology: people who vote take themselves to a booth alone, and put the paper slip with their chosen candidate – from a paper where the candidates' photos are already printed – into an envelope.
When officers recognize voters coming to cast their votes, they will put their sealed envelopes into the ballot box and sign the voting roll.
However, France's election rules suggest a change in language to strict enforcement.
Since 1988, tamper-proof ballot boxes must be used, so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes already inside the box and that only the envelopes issued to authorized voters and which have been accounted for are present.
Candidates will be able to send their representatives to observe every stage of the process. Shared volunteers will count the votes, which is done under strict supervision and has a specific procedure.

Some reports state the official death toll is eight, and official reports confirm 30 people were injured, but the final number is still unknown.
The animals, having consumed contaminated pet food, were dying; both cyanuric acid and melamine were found in their urine samples.
Researchers at the university have said that the two compounds combine to form crystals that interfere with kidney function.
People investigating found crystals formed in cat urine due to a mixture of melamine and cyanuric acid.
Compared to infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), this crystal’s structure and crystals found were similar to those found in the urine of affected pets.
I don’t know if you realize it, but most of the goods in this country arrived duty-free from Central America.
Back then, we were being taxed through tariffs in Central American countries on 80 percent of our imports. We will do your medicine (treat you). Our behavior is friendly.
This didn't amount to anything; this is not alright at all.
We only want this much from you people – that you treat us the way we treat you.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
This bill required that violent video games sold in the state of California have a sticker with "18" clearly visible on them, and imposed a penalty of $1000 per offense for selling these video games to a minor.
The Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer QC issued a statement this morning announcing that prosecutions would be brought against both Hoon and Price.
He has resigned, and MP Ed Davey has entered the cabinet in his place. There is hope that MP Norman Lamb will become the Trade Minister in place of Davey.
The hearing regarding Hyun and Price is scheduled for February 16th at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Among those who died were 25-year-old Nicholas Eldon and 21-year-old Zachary Kudback; Kudback was the driver.
Edgar Vezula was injured in the jaw, while Christopher Schneider required surgery to repair damage to his face.
They kept aiming a weapon at the fifth man's clothes, but didn't hit him. Schneider isn’t feeling pain, he can't see out of one eye, a portion of his skull is missing, and his face has been rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider is testifying via video link from his country’s USAF base.
After the event on Wednesday, she participated in two individual races at the Carpenedo Championship.
She started the race very fast, but couldn't finish the first lap. Out of 116 competitors, 36 people had the same result in this race.
She competed in the second giant slalom race, finishing 10th in the women's sitting group with a total run time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes behind the winner, Claudia Loesch of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the 9th-place finisher, Zsofi Dani of Hungary.
In the women's sitting group, four skiers did not finish their race, and in the giant slalom, 45 out of a total of 117 skiers did not receive a ranking in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered the woman's mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhut Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandrashekhar Solanki stated that the accused entered the court with his face covered with a cap.
Although a car collided with the house, there were three people inside, but no one was injured.
The driver had a lot of injuries on his clothes.
The road was blocked for a while until emergency services personnel extracted the driver from the red Audi TT after a car collision occurred on the road.
They were first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
He was brought to Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his son.
She is in custody for questioning and investigation, but her photo has been printed everywhere to such an extent that any observer could tamper with the evidence.
In the UK, this is a common occurrence, but the Scottish legal system works differently, and it could be due to the printed bias of the photographs in the eyes of their courts.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University writes, "If journalists publish photos and sketches of any suspect, it means they are walking a dangerous path."
The Crown Office, which is overall in charge of the prosecution, indicated to the journalists that no comment should be made at least until the case is ongoing.
According to the information received, the documents discuss the disputed borders—specifically, the borders that Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East war boundaries.
According to what was said, the other issues raised include the matter of a holy, future Jerusalem state for both countries and the Jordan Valley issue.
After signing the agreement, Israel demands that the army currently present in the valley remain there for another ten years, while the PA is prepared to withdraw its forces after just five years.
During the supplementary pest control trial, marksmen were being closely monitored by the rangers, because the monitoring of the test was being done and its effectiveness was also being assessed.
Volunteers were recruited in partnership with NSW Police and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. for the Game Management Program of the Sporting Shooter Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the operational inspector for Park Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, clear instructions regarding the proper safety and training were given to the four target shooters selected for the first shooting.
Yesterday, nine members took oath in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth CEP in the last four years at Marteli.
Under the measures taken to lead the country towards new elections, the Presidential Commission last month recommended the removal of the former CEP President from their position.
This commission responded to Martelli regarding the protests that spread against the government in October.
This protest, which sometimes turned violent, started because elections hadn't been held since 2011.
A case has come to light where approximately 60 iPods overheated and were damaged, with six of them catching fire and four people sustaining minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that there is information regarding 27 accidents related to OK equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 instances of overheating, which the company is calling "not serious."
The ministry responded, calling the delay in Apple’s report “deeply regrettable.”
An earthquake occurred in Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, there are no reports of damage from the earthquake in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center says there are no signs of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus full of Hong Kong tourists and held them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza started firing at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many of those who were held captive have been released, but six people have died so far.
Before this, six hostages were released, including a Filipino photographer with children and the elderly.
A photographer took the place of a woman among the hostages because she needed to use the restroom. He was shot after Mendoza.
Following in her father’s footsteps, Ligins built her future in the field of medicine.
She received training as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While Ligins was continuing to work at the hospital, he started researching about preterm labor in his free time.
Research revealed that administering a specific hormone can accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Even the fellow wrestlers paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. She was our first manager. Luna died on two full moon nights. This is unique like them. She was a strong, loving woman."
Dustin "Goldst" Runnels said, “Luna has become really strange… she’s trying her best to ignore me… I have feelings for her and she misses me a lot… I hope she’s in a good place.”
Of the 1,400 people who participated in a poll before the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed Australia becoming a republic was 8 percent higher than in 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed while campaigning in the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Among those polled, 34 percent said they want Queen Elizabeth to be the last Queen of Australia.
At the height of the poll, 29 percent of those included in the survey believed that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The athlete who won a gold medal in the Olympics also competed in the Commonwealth Games, swimming in the 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle, and three relay events, but doubts arose regarding whether their health was alright due to their injury.
He was refusing to take the medicine he needed for his chest pain, saying he’d rather take it while playing; therefore, he wasn’t able to get the medicine.
Mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper of Central Missouri University has discovered the largest prime number known to date, as of January 25th.
In early February, many people investigated its accuracy using various hardware and software, and then its announcement was made.
It is possible that comets brought water to Earth along with organic molecules that could have formed proteins and been helpful for life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and they especially want to know how Earth was formed after comets collided with it.
At 53, Cuomo began his governorship at the start of the year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political nonsense and foolishness".
It is believed that he contested the presidential election in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that flies airplanes on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite-based technology, a departure from older ground-radar-based techniques, to track aircraft with a high degree of accuracy and provide pilots with extremely precise information.
No additional transportation was provided in Wembley, and ground-level trains did not stop. Additionally, there were no car parking or park-and-ride facilities.
The fear of transport issues increases the likelihood that team supporters will be forced to watch games behind closed doors without being able to attend.
A study published in the Science journal on Thursday reveals that a new species of bird is evolving in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have revealed that the new species evolved in just two generations, but this process took a long time due to interbreeding between a local Darwin’s finch, *Geospiza fortis*, and an immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold is workable in all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into small forms as well.
It can be drawn out like a thin wire, and twisted into a knot. It can be hammered with a hammer, or shaped and bent like a sheet.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used for decoration in hand-painted books, meaning "illuminated manuscripts."
The pH of a chemical is called that. You can identify it using an indicator made from red cabbage juice.
Depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is, the cabbage juice changes its color.
The pH level is indicated according to the amount of hydrogen ions in the tested chemical (H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons because they have lost their electrons (this is because a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Two handfuls of sattu flour were mixed together, then kneaded into a dough ball with clean and wet hands.
The moisture in the hands reacted with the outer layer, which felt very strange and formed a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets connected to a very sophisticated drainage system for removing wastewater.
Evidence of systems for draining wastewater from toilets has been found in Minoan cities of Crete and the houses of Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China as well. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses which were for both men and women.
When you talk to someone thousands of miles away, you use satellites.
Satellites in space pick up your call and send it back down almost instantly.
Satellites were sent into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth’s atmosphere spoils some of the light and views for us.
To place satellites or telescopes in space, a very large rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in a wonderful way. The biggest thing the wheel did for us was making it very easy and fast to go from one place to another, or to transport goods from one place to another.
We have provided this train, car, and many other modes of transport.
Underneath it, there are medium-sized feline predators that hunt from rabbits to deer and gazelle-like medium-sized animals.
There are many such small cat-like animal species (including domestic cats) that hunt various small creatures like insects, mice, lizards, and birds for sustenance.
Their success lies in Neesh's concept, meaning a unique skill that everyone possesses and which prevents them from competition with others.
Cats in their breed are generally very social and they live in large groups, which are called prides.
Pride has relationships with one to three adult males and with them, thirty to forty females and young children are made.
Because there were many sisters and daughters in a large family, the women of the Serini clan were often very closely connected to each other.
A lion’s pride is much like a pack of dogs or wolves. It’s surprising that the behavior of lions and dogs is so similar (but not like that of other big cats) and all of them are very dangerous in the same way for their prey.
A muscular tiger can climb trees (but not very well), can fly, can jump from a distance, and can pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. Only these four cat species can roar.
As the jackal howls with its mouth open, the tiger’s roar isn’t like that, but it sounds as if someone irritable is shouting.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. If they can catch them, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt prey on the ground by scenting it out, tracking it, and then catching it.
At night, they can be seen very clearly in the infrared, and they can also move stealthily. Ocelots blend into their surroundings to hunt and pounce to catch their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main group – like when they wander and reach a mountain or river, or arrive on a new island and find it difficult to return to their original group – they find themselves in a different environment than before.
With a new environment comes different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to adapt in new ways to become stronger competitors compared to previous needs.
Those who were part of the old population haven't changed much, their father needs to adapt in the same way he used to be.
Over time, as new populations adapt to their new environments, their differences from other populations gradually diminish.
Slowly, after thousands of years, or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different from each other that they won’t be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means a new species has formed. Speciation is an event that cannot be stopped and is a very important part of the process of evolution.
Trees and plants create oxygen, which allows people to breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide we exhale with our breath.
Trees and plants make their food from the sunlight, which is called photosynthesis. They also give us shade.
We built our house and clothes from trees. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without trees and plants, living beings cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of its time, which is why it feared no one, except other Mosasaurs.
It had a long jaw with approximately 70 teeth as sharp as razors, and all those teeth were located inside its mouth, upwards. Meaning, once it got its mouth around the prey’s young, there was no chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but it seems this person’s tongue told tales. Their meal included turtle, a large fish, some mollusks, and perhaps they were cannibals too.
This creature left no living thing that entered the water untouched, even if it was a large dinosaur, and T. Rex stood no chance against it.
We recognize many things that the Romans used to eat, but their banquets also included different and unique dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and compassionate people sat on chairs to eat, the wealthy, when they had a feast, would lie on their sides to eat.
Ancient Rome's cuisine did not include all the things that later came to Europe from America or Asia in subsequent centuries.
For example, they didn’t have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and ancient Romans never ate turkey.
The people of Babylon first built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People used to bring sacrifices in the name of God, and the priests would fulfill the needs of the deity through rituals and festivals.
In every temple, there is a courtyard and inside, a sacred place where only the priest is allowed to go.
Sometimes, on top of the temple complex, special pyramid-shaped towers were built. These towers were called Zigurats.
That minaret’s top was a sacred place for God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house loses its importance.
The lives of Hebrew families mostly unfolded outdoors, in the open air.
The women were continuously cooking in the courtyard; a shop would open with a table set up in the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There weren't any large forests on Cannon’s land, so wood was very expensive there.
Greenland wasn’t really settled. Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he went further west, he discovered Greenland and named it so.
But even before his discovery, the Eskimo tribe had been living there.
It’s true that almost the entire region was ‘Scandinavian’, but the people of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had a lot of differences in their kings, customs, and history.
If you’ve seen the National Treasure movie, then it’s possible for you to believe that a treasure map was created behind the Declaration of Independence.
That’s not the honest truth. There’s something written on the back of that document, but it’s not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration date July 4, 1776" were written beneath the Declaration of Independence. This was written in reverse at the very bottom of the document.
Nobody really knows exactly who wrote this, but it is known that it was folded to preserve a large (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) leather document collection.
So, it can be assumed that this writing was simply placed there like a small mark.
D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the northern part of France, but the south remained unliberated.
This region was under the rule of France's "Vichy". These were the people who made a peace agreement with Germany in 1940 and, instead of fighting the invaders, worked with them.
On August 15, 1940, allied country France was attacked in the south. It was named "Operation Dragon".
Within just two weeks, America and liberated France joined forces to free Southern France and then turned towards Germany.
Civilization is called a culture where a large group of people are connected, live together, work together and form a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word *civilis*, meaning citizen. This is related to the Latin *civis*, also meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state. In a way, it also indicates the form of a society.
City-states led to the development of countries. The meaning of a culture connected to a civilization is that knowledge is passed down from one generation to the next, culture continues from one generation to another, and its spread occurs.
Small, localized cultures vanished without leaving any historical evidence and were unable to establish an identity as a civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states came together for the first time to form a weak central government – under the Articles of Confederation, Congress was the sole constituent.
Congress did not have any right to impose taxes, and why would it, without any national executive or judiciary, depend on state officials to implement all its rules, and those officials would never cooperate.
He/She did not have any authority to override laws and taxes in the middle of the state/kingdom.
Changes to the delimitation required the consensus of all states, and the central government took all the states so lightly that their representatives were mostly absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was also the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
In the northern regions, winter sports are very popular, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to Japan being a cluster/group of islands, from a geographical perspective it is sometimes also called an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors passed by and named it Ilha Formosa, which means "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began introducing changes to the primitive methods of grain cultivation that existed there. They started employing Chinese laborers in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, declared it a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu mainly has three buildings, which are named Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and Room of the Three Windows.
Around the complex, many buildings have been reconstructed, allowing viewers to get an idea of how they originally looked when first built.
Since 1976, thirty percent of the forests have been rebuilt and destroyed, and this work is still ongoing.
For example, the most common format in the world for taking photos of stationary objects is 35mm, which was the most predominantly used film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It’s still being made, but it’s certain that its aspect will be found in the image sensors of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually deceptive, because its width is 36mm and its height is 24mm.
In this format, the aspect ratio (obtained by dividing the width by the height to get a whole number) is called 3:2.
Typically, many Go formats (like, for example, the APS family of formats) have an aspect ratio of 1:1, or are equal to it.
The rule of thirds is often misused and made a joke of, but it’s a simple guideline for creating dimension within an image without distorting its composition.
According to this, the best place for the main subject is where lines meeting at right angles and diagonally divide it into three parts each (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very wealthy and powerful, began to have its property and operations investigated.
For over a thousand years, Christianity, despite differences in language and customs among the kingdoms of Europe, has bound them together as one.
The effect of this omnipresent power falls on everyone, whether they are kings or subjects.
One tenet of Christian faith is that money should be used to help people in crisis and to alleviate poverty. This is why money is specifically collected by the church.
The central authority of the Church in Rome has existed for thousands of years. Many questions arise from this congregation of power and money, as to whether the principles with which it was founded are being fulfilled.
Immediately after the fighting began, Britain started a naval blockade of Germany.
This blockade has generally been considered in accordance with international law and understandings for the past two centuries, but this strategy of preventing essential supplies from reaching the army and the general public proved successful.
Britain mined international waters across a large part of the sea to prevent ships from approaching, creating a danger even for vessels not involved in the conflict.
Why has there been very little reaction to this strategy, as Germany was hoping for such a reaction in its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and national attitudes were peaceful and isolationist.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, all nations expressed a desire to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to America to work for the Edison Company located in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Bachelor (his former manager) to recommend him to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a truly unique way of perceiving different periods of time. It depicted China, or rather each era of every ruling dynasty, as a separate dynasty itself.
And it was a turbulent time between every royal family when the state was divided. It was an era of the three most well-known states during such times, which were Haan and the royal families between whom it lasted for 60 years.
In that era, there was a fierce struggle among many wealthy and powerful politicians for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms period was the most bloody time. Thousands of people were killed to sit on the largest and highest throne in the Xian Palace during this time.
It had various social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from autocracy to republic, changes in nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to its people, not to any single king.
Besides this, after the revolution, employment became available to all male applicants, opening a path to success for those who desired to progress and achieve it.
This is the state of the army these days – why shouldn't ranking in the army be based on merit rather than class?
The French Revolution also inspired the working class people of many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad took a great interest in matters beyond worldly life. To contemplate and reflect, he would frequently visit a cave known as “Heera” (diamond) on Mount “Noor” (light).
In the flow of time, this cave reveals a very vivid and detailed image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclination that has survived.
North of Mecca, where the mountains are formed, this cave, located on the peak of one of those mountains, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, this is the cave of the one who knows, it’s not easy to find. Once a person enters the cave, they become completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Above, one can see only the clear, beautiful sky and several surrounding hills; nothing else is visible. After entering the cave, very little of the outside world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today in the same way.
This pyramid is one of the great pyramids built by the people of Egypt three centuries before Jesus, built in honor of the deceased Pharaohs.
In the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, located on the Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis," many pyramids exist (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest). Here, there are also many small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu’s wife and family members.
"Up Bo" looks like a V, and "Down Bo" like a staple, or like a square with its lower part missing.
Up means you should start from above and push down, and down means you should start from the frog (the place where your hands hold) and pull up.
You often speak in a soft voice, while Down speaks strongly and assertively.
She hesitated to create her own symbols with a pencil, but remembered that the symbols that were printed were created for some reason in music, and paid attention to that.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of Parisian women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, to move from the market at Versailles to Paris against their will.
The car those people were returning to Paris in was surrounded by crowds on all sides, and this crowd was chanting threatening slogans against the king and queen.
The crowd kept forcing open the windows of the king and queen’s carriage.
Once, amidst the crowd, a man in front of Queen Derael began waving the severed head of a falcon.
The war expenses incurred in the imperialist America’s victory over the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people.
A large portion of their expenses had to be paid as taxes to the American colonial government, and interest was accrued on bonds issued through Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
But the longest exploitation of the Filipino people greatly benefited American imperialism.
To understand Templar, it’s first necessary to understand why this order was created.
The period in which these events occurred is generally known as the High Middle Ages, and it spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD) in European history.
High Middle Ages refers to the time before the Early Middle Ages, and Late Middle Ages refers to the time after, which ended around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing many ideas that are used, ranging from technological advancement or necessity to a serious mindset that assumes human life operates according to a logic driven by scientific principles, with technology embedded everywhere within it.
People who excessively understand technological determinism generally present two ideas: that technological development, rising above cultural or political influences, creates its own path, and also that technology, in turn, leaves its own "impact" on the society that embodies it, rather than on the society that has been socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that road development is necessary because of cars.
However, the extensive road network spread across the country isn't economically necessary for just a few motorcars, therefore new ways of manufacturing cars are being developed so that the cost of buying and maintaining them can be reduced.
When a large number of people buy cars, the incidents of accidents on the road can increase. Therefore, there seems to be a need for the development of new technologies so that the cost of repairing damaged cars can be reduced.
Naturalism contains an element of cultural determinism, as evidenced by writers like Flaubert and Schlegel.
In the context of naturalism, people were adapting geography to their own needs, and with time, customs and culture associated with that geography were born. Because these new customs and cultures arose according to the place of the society, they were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is now called the fashion capital of the world, similarly Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
This was considered a place of great comfort and its prominence/status was established from around 400 BCE and lasted until approximately 1100 BCE.
Its prestige declined around the 12th century, because the Crusaders brought back valuable gifts like silk fabrics and spices, which were all sent back. The reason behind this was that its price was so high that it wasn't possible to sell it in the Byzantine market.
This was a time when Paris began to take the place of Constantinople, which was called the fashion capital.
Gothic styles were at their peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, there was a strong influence of Byzantine culture on these fabrics.
However, at that time, communication channels were slow, and the West was 25 to 30 years behind the East in terms of progress.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major events of that time was the use of buttons to fasten clothes tightly, due to conflicts arising from religious wars.
Subsistence farming is a type of farming where farmers grow grains solely to feed their families.
Subsistence farming is common and mostly organic, where seeds from the farm’s own harvest are used. Crop rotation or other simple methods are employed to maximize yield.
Historically, many farmers have been associated with discharge farming, and now such farming happens in many progressive countries.
A subculture is a group of people who hold similar beliefs and are often overlooked based on societal norms; the subculture provides them with a sense of identity.
Subcultural members can differ based on age, caste, class, location, and gender.
The factors on the basis of which any subculture can be differentiated may include language, interests, religion, politics, gender, geography, or many such factors.
Members of a subculture display their membership in a distinct and symbolic way. This symbolism can manifest as fashion, style, or manner of speech.
One of the most common ways used to understand the importance of socialization is to learn about unfortunate children who, as they grew up, were mistreated by adults, either ignored, or not socialized at all.
People like this are often called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are kept restrained—held in one place or tied up—by people (often their parents); in some cases, the parents abandon them because of a lack of proper intellectual and physical development.
The foolish boy abandoned everyone or ran away, after having endured much torment and trauma beforehand.
Some people say that they raised animals, while others believe they lived alone in the forest.
When a feral child is raised completely by non-human (animal) beings, that child’s behavior becomes almost entirely (within physical limits) like those animals, especially like the caregiver animals, as if detached from humans or indifferent to them.
Learning based on projects is easy and a lot more fun, but scaffolding goes a step further than even that.
Scaffolding isn’t just a way to learn; it also helps those who want to learn something new, like a computer program, or start a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher can be a scaffold, just as a small paperclip man from Microsoft Office can be a scaffold.
Virtual scaffolding software is the internal part whose purpose is to ask questions, give hints, and explain the methods that students find difficult to understand on their own.
Children are sent to care centers for many reasons, such as neglect, mistreatment, and even coercion.
No child should grow up in an environment where there is no nourishment, care, and education, but children are growing up in such environments.
We need to understand that the daycare center is a safe place for children like these.
We need childcare systems that are loving, nurturing, provide stable education, and offer trustworthy healthcare facilities.
The care center should provide all the necessary things that the children lacked before coming here.
Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
Due to the completely different specialties of the internet, its use shows a unique form regarding personal satisfaction.
For example, "education" and "socialization" are considered strong motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Emery and McCord (1998) when exploring audience perceptions of websites, found that “personal connection” and “attempts to advance relationships” were also a new kind of motivation for the internet.
Significant research has been done in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions (micro-expressions) and facial movements that appear on the face for a short time, using video recording.
Specifically, if someone can accurately understand the subtle, fleeting facial expressions (micro-expressions), they can tell whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks in his paper, “The President’s Speech,” explained that those affected by brain damage, who are unable to understand what is being said, can still discern the truth of a matter.
They go so far as to say that even a domesticated dog possesses the capacity to understand human behavior.
A research conducted in the 20th century revealed that genetic variation is of two types: hidden and open.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and natural selection eliminates less fit variations from this pool.
Separation and recombination have caused differences between the two poles to shift back and forth across generations.
In the savanna, it’s difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to fulfill their amino acid needs from the local trees and plants.
If this need is not met, the consequences are severe: stunted growth, malnutrition, and death before their time.
You can get protein from the leaves and fruits of the most easily available plants, but even primates like us can’t digest them raw.
However, it can digest without any issues if given animal food (ants, termites, eggs) and also provides a high amount of protein with essential amino acids from these sources.
After considering all this, there's no doubt that our ancestors also fulfilled their "protein needs" in the same way that chimpanzees do today.
Being woken up during sleep and then falling back asleep after a few moments (10-60 minutes) is a normal process.
This task can be done easily with the help of a low-volume alarm clock. The clock will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you have a habit of repeatedly setting the alarm on your alarm clock while sleepy, you can place the clock in another corner of the room. This way, you’ll have to get out of bed to turn the clock off.
According to another biorhythm technique, you should drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which are considered diuretics) before sleeping, so you might have to get up to urinate during your sleep.
The amount of peace a person has inside is measured by the inverse of the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less stress you have, the more positive thinking you’ll have in life. Everyone will be able to keep themselves completely peaceful and content.
Everyone can attain liberation. It just becomes difficult to attain liberation due to internal stress and negative thinking.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Lord Buddha, which expanded through the Mahayana branch’s path of love and Indian yoga science.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. They include Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the principle of love for everyone.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of knowledge) is awakened through yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and meditation.
In Tibetan meditation, the primary importance is given to divine yoga. By observing different deities, one is purified through energy, the chakras are awakened, and the consciousness of knowledge is awakened.
In World War II, Germany and the USSR, as well as America, were enemies to each other, as an alliance formed between them. After the war ended, the countries separated due to clashes of systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the war ended, old friends became enemies and the Cold War began.
This has been going on for the next 40 years, and this war was actually fought in arenas from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places, between different proxy armies.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed, retreating behind the Romanian front with the hope of regrouping.
However, this plan was rendered useless overnight when the Soviet Union, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and numerous other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, deployed 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army into the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after attacking Poland's eastern territories.
The best way to transport goods and people from one place to another across the sea is by water vessel/ship.
The traditional function of the navy was to ensure the safe transport of the country's people and goods from one place to another, and to create difficulties for enemy nations in doing the same.
A recent prime example of this was the WWII campaign in the North Atlantic. To help Britain, America was trying to transport people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean.
At precisely that time, they were trying to stop the movement using German U-boats.
If the Allied nations had lost, Germany would have undoubtedly conquered Britain, because the rest of Europe would have fallen to it.
It seems that around 10,000 years ago, goat herding began for the first time on the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
People of ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to their milk, hair, meat, and hides.
The goats that are raised are often seen grazing in herds and roaming around hills or wherever there’s pasture. Mostly, young boys or older boys who are still considered young herd them – these boys are now called shepherds. This method of animal husbandry is still practiced today.
Wagonways were constructed in England in the 16th century.
It was like this, in the wagons there were planks of wood, one facing the other, but on the bumpy road the horse could pull them much faster and carry a heavier load.
The use of cross ties to keep the rails in place started quite a long time ago. But gradually, it was realized that if there was an iron strip on top, the track would be much better.
This has become commonplace, but the wooden wheels of the wagon made of iron wore down more.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron railway was started.
Walking was the earliest mode of transport. Humans began walking upright from the beginning of Homo erectus (meaning the man who stood straight and walked on two legs) around 20 lakh years ago.
Before them, Australopithecus couldn't walk upright like this.
Around 42-39 million years ago, bipedalism was observed in Australopithecus fossils, but Sahelanthropus, from 70 million years ago, could already walk on two legs.
We can start living in a way that causes the least harm to the environment, participate in environmental movements, and even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
It seems like this situation calls for a thorough and comprehensive treatment. But if we don't want just a temporary fix, we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it completely.
It has become absolutely clear that due to scientific and technological development, the world has changed a lot, and problems have increased further due to a large population and the extraordinary lifestyles of human beings.
After Congress adopted the Declaration on July 4th, signatures of Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson were affixed to a handwritten draft, and it was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlop, a few blocks away, for printing.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, which are now known as "Dunlop Broadsides."
For the first time on July 8th, John Nixon read aloud in front of everyone in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which he was to read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on July 10th.
There are 25 copies of the Dunlop broadside remaining, which are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't believe this is a dinosaur because it has wings and can fly.
Nowadays, there are many birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have hooves and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on on-off switches, which are coded as binary numbers.
In a binary number, only one of two values is possible, 0 or 1, and these are called binary digits or bits when using computer terminology.
It's not immediately possible to detect any poison inside the body. Symptoms like vomiting are very common, and it can be difficult to identify this quickly.
The best way to identify indoor poisoning is to look for medication, or an open container of any poisonous chemical in the house.
See the label stuck on the box for instructions regarding first aid for any specific poison.
Entomologists will use the term "bug" formally to explain insect categorization and groupings.
This word originated from the term for bed-bugs, which was commonly used in ancient times. This bug also thrives on human bodies.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs, both of these insects are called ectoparasites because they persistently feed on the hosts whose bodies they originate from.
Across the entire United States, approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) exist, making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that the possibility of becoming MS is twice as high in women than in men.
A couple can decide whether or not it is in their or their child’s best interest to raise the child.
This couple has decided to give up their child for adoption.
By adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works scientifically. Most scientific discoveries ultimately reveal this very method.
This alone cannot be used, but experimentation and experiments are tests that eliminate one or many possible hypotheses. Through questioning and observation, it guides scientific discovery.
Naturalists and philosophers paid attention to ancient and high-quality books, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were considered valid in all matters of science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of the people of Greece diminished, their connection with Greek philosophy and science in the West faded away.
The functioning of the body's physiology and many processes often depend in a very specific way on the internal cycles created by the biological clock.
A periodic rhythm that doesn't solely depend on external periodic signals has been noted for most living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
It’s a biological clock, self-made and maintained, a pendulum that continues to run and complete its cycle on time even without external signals.
DNA is a genetic material, and the Hershey-Chase experiment is a major piece of evidence suggesting this.
Hershey and Chase used a phage or virus to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They used two approaches, either attaching radioactive phosphorus to identify DNA in one phase, or attaching radioactive sulfur to identify proteins in the other phase.
The types of mutations, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a germline cell or not, can all have different effects on mutations.
Mutations that occur in germline cells are passed on to offspring, but mutations that occur elsewhere either kill the cell or cause cancer.
Nature-based tourism will attract those people who enjoy visiting natural areas to experience the thrill of observing plants and animals in their wild habitat.
Activities that can be done in that place include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying the ecosystem.
Someone saw an orangutan in Borneo, took photos, and learned about it.
Every morning, people set out from their small towns and villages towards their workplaces, passing by those who have already left their work behind them.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is connected in some way or another and supports a transportation system based on personal reasons.
Science indicates that due to this large carbon economy, the biosphere – which has contributed to human development over the last twenty lakh (two million) years – has deviated from a state of equilibrium.
Every person should participate in society and use the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges – that’s the kind of education one receives.
Why was the transportation system given the opportunity to fail like this, and why does it fail on a daily basis? Are the transportation engineers completely incompetent? Or is there some other fundamental reason for this?
Traffic flow is the study of the differing driving and movement of vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent accuracy.
However, by chance, the driver will behave within a reasonably consistent limit; therefore, there will be some reasonable stability in the traffic stream and this can be shown mathematically to a large extent.
To describe traffic flow well, a relationship has been established between three main things: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This will help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities related to this.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more skillfully.
Being able to fold their wings back against their bodies benefits most insects.
They spread out into small places to hide from their hunters.
These days there's a bug going around that can't fold its wings back – it's the dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many others conversely believed that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It feels right, because it doesn't seem like the earth is rotating; you tell me, does it rotate?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It flows with eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes being miles wide.
About twenty percent of all the water flowing from the rivers of the earth into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Its construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but it never surpassed the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and technical construction.
The new empire’s ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their former people, which were already a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official correspondence.
Italian is a language used in everyday life by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these were found in their original form in nature and could be easily excavated from the ground with the help of primitive tools.
A philosopher named Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is made of one or a mixture of four elements. These four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This substance exists in four states (in this order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also suggests the principle that these can transform into new substances and appear in forms we observe.
An alloy is fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, other metals also exist, such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to have alloys in which non-metallic elements like carbon are found in significant quantities.
Everything in the universe is made of some or the other substance. All substances are made of small particles called atoms.
An atom is so small that billions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Well, when the pencil was first made, people liked it very much.
It's a matter of regret that as newer ways of writing emerge, the importance and use of pencils diminish.
People now write messages on computer screens, so they use pencils less.
It's funny to think that whenever something new comes along, what happens to the keyboard.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to hold many protons and neutrons together in a nucleus.
Like getting a heavy vehicle up a hill. The nucleus needs to be twisted again and some energy extracted from it.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they can decay spontaneously or with very little prompting.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick near the edges and 100 km thick further away.
It grows thin under Maria and thick under Highlands.
Nearby areas could have suffered more because the crust is thin. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Material theory focuses on finding out what people like or are interested in.
This principle explains that people have certain desires and/or needs that become part of their personality as they become adults.
This theory considers why people desire things and what factors in their environment cause them to want to do or not do something.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
Generally, when managers get the chance to lead their old companions, two types of behaviors can be observed. One of these could be considering themselves “one of the team members.”
People of this type of management struggle with making unpopular decisions, being firm, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
When someone steps into a managerial role, they become a completely different person. They feel like they need to change everything the team does and want to control every aspect of it.
Why ask, the leader is solely responsible for the team’s success and failure.
This kind of behavior often creates rifts between leaders and the other members of the team.
The quality of work from a virtual team is also measured on the same scale as the evaluation of work from traditional teams, but there are certainly some differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact for their physical teams.
Compared to traditional team members, they often have a lot more freedom because their team can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
In the true sense, the presence of an “invisible team” (Larsen & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
“The Invisible Team” is the management team to which every member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why did any organization choose a method that takes so much time for establishing an educational institution? Implementing the concept of organizational learning is a recent change/goal.
When any organization's working departments utilize all available resources effectively, then communication of creativity and simplicity can occur.
For example, when organizations work together to overcome obstacles, a new approach to fulfilling customer needs develops.
For any organization to work in a new way, it is essential that its leaders foster a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a way organizations can operate more effectively.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for conducting theoretical investigations of consciousness. Reducing the scope of such explorations can make it even more precise.
The relationship between the pathology of the brain and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that damage, injury, wounds, and tumors in the brain can affect behavior and are a cause of changes in some mental functions.
With the advent of new technology, we got the opportunity to observe and investigate the brain's structure and how it works in ways that had never been seen before.
This provided us with a lot of information and material to build a simulation model that will help us understand how the brain works.
In science fiction, AI has a very different meaning, but AI is an important branch of computer science, related to adapting the behavior, learning, and intelligence of machines.
AI research is done to create machines that can automatically perform tasks that require intelligence.
Like, controlling, planning and programming, understanding the consumer's problems and being able to respond to them, along with recognizing handwriting, voice, and facial features.
This has become a completely different topic, one that emphasizes solutions to problems occurring in real life.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in software for home computers and video games.
A field trip is a big part of any class. Teachers often like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual field trips. Students will be able to see museum artifacts, aquariums, and beautiful artworks while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is a wonderful way to consider and share experiences on any trip with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online like a scrapbook.
The blog can also help in improving students' writing. However, students often make grammatical and spelling errors in their blogs initially, but the presence of viewers generally corrects this.
Because students often tend to be the most critical reviewers, those who write blogs have started trying to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging together will help students learn more about the world around them. Students will be inspired to write good and interesting blogs to increase viewers’ interest (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to learn beyond traditional schooling.
Effective use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to content found on the internet, students can define their position in relation to the writing of others, and simultaneously develop an outline of their own opinions on specific issues (Orevec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada is a captivating, bilingual capital where there are many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
And to the south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, Muskoka, and beyond them, the beauty of nature spreads.
This is all for many other reasons why Ontario, Canada is the best place for people from outside.
In response to this, a very large area has a very sparse population, and some parts are almost uninhabited jungle.
This population is surprising to many when compared: the number of African Americans living in America is greater than the total population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is still the largest and a continent in itself.
Most small islands are independent nations, but are associated with France, and they are all known as luxury beach resorts.
Arab people also descended upon this land of Islam, and took large-scale control of Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, this region is bordered by the coast, and in the south and west, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women are advised to state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can be very helpful (though it looks like food is very expensive there).
It’s common for husbands to consider harassment—like following or holding hands—as normal due to differences in cultural understanding.
A true man shows no hesitation in rejecting something wrong and firmly stands by his convictions without fear (it is absolutely not right, whether or not culture approves!).
Casablanca, the modern city, was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port named Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail rebuilt this city as a capital, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least preferred places for shopping in all of Morocco.
It’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods near the old Medina, like tagines, earthenware, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of gigots, but all of this is only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo. This volcanic eruption turned the roads of nearby cities and the main part of the city into rubble.
Goma city is safe to wander in, but if you want to roam outside of it, first investigate the surrounding areas and understand that there is a war-like situation in the North Kivu province.
This city is not only a gateway to volcanoes and other small mountains in Africa, but it’s also a base camp for mountain gorilla trekking.
To get around in Goma, you can hire motorcycle taxis (boda-bodas). For short distances, you'll generally need to spend around 500 Congolese francs in local currency.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for a foreign, distant land.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, but due to its own prestige, it is a center of attraction for tourists. There is also an airport here.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desertification.
Henry Louis Gates was a key figure during his PBS special Wonders of the African World.
This city is completely different from all other cities in the world, because its character is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is spread over 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a unique wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a leading national park in South African National Parks (SANParks).
These are mostly the daily conservation and entry fees for South African national parks.
A wild card could be beneficial for someone, providing entry into any one of South Africa’s beautiful South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is considered a major tourist attraction due to its own name, area, and convenient location in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong skyline-forming buildings are likened to a magnificent bar chart, clarified by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, don't leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely filled on land reclaimed along the north shore.
This is a place that was taken over by British colonialists, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region, it’s a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending inland from the coast for 80 km (50 miles) into Bangladesh and Indian territories.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested area within the borders of India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
This isn't a barren mangrove swamp—it includes some of the last remaining stands of powerful forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which approximately one-third is included in water/marshy areas.
Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
Most buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day, although the majority, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Most of the buses running in the district were full, so it’s better to book your ticket a few days in advance.
In most kilns, small Japanese coasters are used, which are comfortable and strong.
Shared taxis like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200) are a quick and comfortable way to get around nearby places.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of these two towers is 83 meters. It is 378 meters long and has two 3.50 meter wide lanes.
The vertical drop of the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn’t opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge was expected to be operational by September 2017, coinciding with the anticipated completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoint.
The Guarani have been the most important indigenous group remaining in eastern Paraguay today, these people live as semi-nomadic hunters, who also practice agriculture to make a living.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous tribes and other groups such as the Guayakur and Paiaguá, who hunted to survive and gathered together to fish.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "vast province of the Indies," came into being as a result of conflicts between Spanish lads and indigenous groups.
Spanish colonization began, which lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has been successful in maintaining its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year will be held at the Los Canitas polo field.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on tournament news and where to get tickets, see the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value has been set equal to one British Pound (GBP).
This island only has one bank where money can be exchanged. This bank is in Stanley, opposite FIC West Store.
British pounds are almost universally accepted on the island and in stable credit cards, and United States dollars are often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on outer islands, but British and US currency can be taken; check with the owners beforehand to determine what forms of payment are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while, conversely, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is in a subtropical climate; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are normal.
The cold can be deceptively chilly: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
Here, what distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons aren't there: the amount of rainfall remains almost uniform throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife should still be treated as wild and not disturbed or fed.
According to park officials, bears and wolves should remain at least 100 yards/meters away from each other, and 25 yards/meters away from other animals.
It doesn't matter how many saints look on, bison, elk, moose, bears, and several large animals could still attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so keep your distance from them.
Be mindful that this can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing scented food items and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1950 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when Germany, America, and Britain’s seven ships refused to leave the harbor.
A British cruiser was abandoned and several ships sank. Approximately 200 American and German people lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau Movement, the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasi Lealofi III resulted from a peaceful gathering in the city.
Because of the merging of two harbors in Auckland, a lot of beaches have been formed. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beach present on the North Shore (in North Harbour district) lies in the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Here, almost all the beaches are sandy where swimming is safe, and on most beaches you’ll find shade from palm trees.
Located on the Waitematā Harbour, Tamaki Drive stretches between all the beaches, in the bustling suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes this family beach gets very crowded, with lots of neat little shops lined up along the shore. It’s considered very safe for swimming here.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it’s not a complex beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are several French wines here, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be much better.
The water from the local tap is completely safe, but if you're still worried, bottled water is readily available.
Australians are not familiar with 'flat white' coffee. A short black is called an 'espresso', cappuccino is filled to the brim with a cup of cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Though mango juice is expensive, it's very good.
Reefs rarely get infections, and it’s rare for reefs to be injured from any cause.
Even so, take advice from the officials, follow all the signals, and pay full attention to the safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found along the coast and river mouths from October to April north of 1770, and occasionally can be found at other times as well.
Sharks might occasionally attack these people caught in fishing nets, but mostly sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The saltwater crocodile is not actively found in the open ocean; its primary habitat is river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Those who book in advance have peace of mind knowing that when they reach their destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agents often have good deals on particularly nice hotels, but with the help of your travel agent, other types of accommodation like camping grounds can also be booked.
Travel agents usually include perks in packages such as breakfast, transportation from/to the airport, flights to and from the destination, and hotel packages.
