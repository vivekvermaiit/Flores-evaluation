One experimental vaccine is believed to reduce mortality from Ebola, but so far, no drug has been conclusively proven to be suitable for treating an existing infection.
One of the antibody cocktails, ZMapp, initially seemed promising in this area, but formal studies showed it offered less benefit in preventing death than hoped.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control drug, meaning it was used as a baseline and the other three drugs were compared to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and agrees with the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.

This confirms the already established theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, while also providing data that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper side and pastel or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
The finding also offers insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis, which is called a vane, but possess all other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers have determined that the rachis likely evolved later in evolution than the other features.
From the structure of the feathers, we can infer that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Although it is a tail from a young dinosaur, researchers believe the sample indicates the feathers came from an adult specimen and not the down of a hatchling.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate the observation of the Sagittarius constellation.
The effect the team hoped to achieve would be caused by tidal forces between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Stream.
Just as the Moon attracts Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also gravitationally influences the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter similarly to how ordinary matter interacts.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is thought to reside around it in the form of a ring composed of numerous small particles.

After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods that dispersed sediment throughout the river were stopped.
This sediment was crucial for the formation of sandbanks and beaches, which became a natural habitat for wild animals and plants.
As a result, two species of fish became extinct, and two more became endangered, including the humpback chub.
Although the water level will only rise a few feet after the flood, authorities hope this will be enough to restore the eroded sandbanks along the river downstream.

Infrared images show temperature differences between night and day, which likely indicates caves.
During the day, it is cooler inside than in the surrounding area, but warmer at night.
"They don't have as stable thermal properties as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a more or less constant temperature, but they are suitable given that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have always been low-tech: voters hide in individual booths and insert a pre-printed ballot paper with their choice marked on it into an envelope.
Once election officials verify the voter’s identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voters’ list.
French election law fairly strictly defines this process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside them at the start of the election and that no other envelopes have been added, except for those submitted by properly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Four female skiers in the women's sitting group did not finish their runs, and out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom, 45 failed to qualify for the competition.
Police in Madagascar have found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are alleged to be Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Senior Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants arrived at court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed so that emergency services could free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Later, the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged Adekoyo with the murder of his son.
He/She is awaiting indictment and legal proceedings in custody, but eyewitness testimony may be unreliable as her/his image was published everywhere.
This is established practice elsewhere under the GDPR, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and the court ruled that the publication of the photographs was potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists are on thin ice if they publish photos of suspects and similar things."
The Crown Prosecution Service, fully responsible for prosecution, indicated to journalists that it would not provide further comment at least until an indictment is filed.
It has been revealed that the document will address a dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to base on the borders prior to the war that took place in the Middle East in 1967.
Other discussed topics were expected to include the future status of Jerusalem, considered holy by both states, and the issues concerning the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority has only agreed to five years of such a presence.
The shooters in the attempt to implement additional pest control were under the scrutiny of guards, as the trial is being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation with NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers are recruited under the patronage of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS Director of Conservation Parks and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety briefings and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission, as part of a package of measures to move the country closer to new elections, proposed the premature resignation of the Temporary Electoral Commission.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, which have at times been violent, were triggered by failed elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating non-functional iPods have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that they were aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company classified as "non-hazardous."
The ministry’s response was that Apple’s postponement of the report was “truly regrettable.”
Mariano experienced an earthquake at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers replaced the elderly lady who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical path.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor in his spare time.
His research shows that adding a hormone to a child accelerates fetal lung development.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two "black boxes" from the plane on Wednesday.
The moon also received bows from fellow wrestlers.
“Luna was the first queen of ECW. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Just as one-of-a-kind as she was herself. A strong woman,” said Tommy Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as oddball as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Among 1400 respondents surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
34 percent of respondents to the survey agree with the call for Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
On one hand, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while on the other hand, 31 percent of respondents believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questionable due to his issues.
He wasn't allowed to take the medication he needs for pain relief, as it is prohibited at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
The discovery, which was published on Tuesday, was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software by the beginning of February.
Comets could represent a source that brought water and organic molecules to Earth, from which proteins can form and which enable life.
Scientists hope to discover how planets are formed, primarily how Earth was formed, as it has been a long time since comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the beginning of this year and last month supported a law to legalize same-sex marriage.
He labelled the rumors as "political smears and nonsense".
They predict that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology, not older technology based on stationary radars, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
They will not be providing any additional transport and overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley, and park and ride facilities and surface car parks will not be available.
Due to fear of a lack of traffic stars, there is a possibility that the game will be forced to be played behind closed doors, without team supporters.
According to a study published on Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has emerged on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported a new species that evolved through hybridization between the endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortis*, and the introduced cactus finch, *Geospiza fortis*, in just two generations, despite previous beliefs that this process takes much longer.
Gold can be shaped into many different forms. It can also be rolled into thin shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into foils.
It can possibly be flattened very thinly and affixed to other metals. Because it can be flattened so thinly, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, known as "illuminated manuscripts".
We call this the pH of a chemical. You can already make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Grape juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of the chemical.
The pH value of tested chemicals is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders and shape them into a ball using clean, damp hands.
Moisture on the palms will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and the formation of a sort of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of a sewage system were found in houses in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women gathered in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then almost instantly bounces it back down.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and views.
A huge rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to transport a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle completely changed the world. One of its most notable contributions is faster and easier transportation.
It brought us the train, the automobile, and many other forms of transport.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
However, there are also numerous small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that feed on a much more numerous prey base, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the niche concept—specifically, dedicated work assigned to each cat, protecting it from competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
In a pack, there are one to three related males, and up to thirty females and young.
As a large family of sisters and daughters, women are typically closely connected to each other.
A pride of lions behaves very similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete and can climb (though not very well), swim, jump large distances, and pull five times stronger than a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four representatives of the big cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't as full and uniform as a lion's, but more disjointed, rasping, and screeching.
Ocelots feed on small animals. If they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are considerably smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and search for animals for food (prey) using their sense of smell, as they sniff where animals have been on the ground.
Due to their night vision, they can see very well at night and also move silently. Ocelots hunt by first blending in with their surroundings, then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population it originated from (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or migrates to a new island and finds it difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment than the one it previously inhabited.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, therefore the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be able to cope with them.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adjustments as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it gradually becomes less and less similar to the other population.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so distinct that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create oxygen that people breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale from their lungs.
Plants produce food through photosynthesis with the help of the sun. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw contained more than 70 exceptionally sharp teeth, and he had additional teeth on the palate, allowing him to devour everything that crossed his path.
We don't have precise data, but it's possible he had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, and other reptiles, and may even have been a cannibal.
He attacked all creatures that entered the water; not even enormous dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus Rex, could withstand him.
Although most of their food would seem familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat on chairs during meals, wealthy men preferred to enjoy their food together, reclining on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, intended to represent the home of that particular deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, while priests tried to satisfy the gods’ needs with rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes they built special columns in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, which were part of temples.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not as important.
The life of a Hebrew family mostly took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; shops were simply open counters facing the street. Houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, therefore wood was exceptionally expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and that he discovered Greenland on his way west and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were all considered "Scandinavian" countries, there were numerous differences among their people, kings, customs, and histories.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Lost, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4th, 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that it was a large document on parchment (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) and was originally stored as a scroll during its early life.
Therefore, it is possible that the bookmark was simply added as a marker.
With the landings on D-Day and the battles that followed, they liberated northern France, while the south remained unconquered.
They were ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who concluded peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces occupied Southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
Americans and the French Free Forces liberated southern France in just two weeks and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of individuals who live and cooperate together, a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word civilis, which means civic, and is related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which in a way also indicates the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. The culture of civilization includes the transmission of knowledge through generations, a lasting cultural legacy, and significant dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and therefore cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states with provisions for a confederation first formed a weak central government – consisting only of a Congress.
The Congress lacked the power to enforce tariffs, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state governments to enforce its laws, which were often unwilling to cooperate.
Furthermore, he had no authority whatsoever to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
Ratifying the articles required the consent of all federal states, but individual federal states did not take the central authority seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became world champions in football in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, inline hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island country in the world.
Due to the collection/group of islands that Japan possesses, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical standpoint.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island named it Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began transforming indigenous grain farming methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the military forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of Taiwan’s west and north coasts and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Sun Temple, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to help tourists better imagine what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most widespread photographic format for still images in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still used today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was also adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format actually – and somewhat unusually – measures 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve gives us the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the ASP family of formats) have the same or very similar aspect ratios.
The rule of thirds, often used and frequently mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and simultaneously provides a measure for composing an image.
According to him, the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny, having grown wealthy and expanded its power.
Christian faith has connected European countries for over a millennium despite differences in language and customs. I
Her pervasive power influenced both kings and common people.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are intended precisely for that purpose.
The seat of the central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to doubt whether it truly follows that principle.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy of cutting off the most important military and civilian supplies proved effective, but this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing large areas of the ocean, thereby endangering even neutral vessels.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany anticipated a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America, where he took a job at Edison's company in New York.
When he arrived in the USA, he had with him only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer), addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China depicted different time periods in a special way; each stage of China, or each family in power, was a recognizable dynasty.
Between individual dynasties, there were also unstable periods when the provinces were divided. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, occurring between the Han and Jin dynasties, and lasting 60 years.
During these periods, fierce battles unfolded between many nobles, who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the grand palace of the city of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, positions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to rise to the top.
This applies to the military as well, as military ranks are now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired numerous other oppressed members of the working class from other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this earthly life. He would visit a cave, known as “Hira” on Mount “Nur” (light), to contemplate.
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a very clear idea of Muhammad’s spiritual aspirations.
The cave, located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Essentially, it’s not easy to find, even if we know it exists. But the interior of the cave offers perfect solitude.
Apart from the clear, beautiful sky overhead and the numerous surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. From within the cave, little of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the seven wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza remains today.
The Great Pyramid, which the Egyptians built in the third century BC, is one of many larger pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza plateau or in the "Giza necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu’s wives and family members.
The signal for "bow up" looks like the letter V, and the signal for "bow down" looks like a staple or a square without a bottom side.
Up means you should start at the top of the bow and push, down means you should start at the frog (that is, where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
Drawing the bow from above usually creates a softer sound, while drawing it from below is stronger and more decisive.
If you wish, you can mark your chord symbols with a pencil, but don't forget that the printed chord symbols are provided for the music, and should therefore be followed.
The enraged crowd of market women forced the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, to leave Versailles for Paris on October 6, 1789.
They were returning to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and screaming threats at the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a royal guard member, killed in Versailles, in front of the frightened queen.
The costs of American imperialism’s wars were actually paid by the Filipino people themselves during the conquest of the Philippines.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to cover most of the costs and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the spectacular profits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would represent foundational income for US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which the order was created.
The period in which these events took place is generally known as the High Middle Ages, denoting a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages came the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological endeavor or technological necessity to the idea that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic connected to scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share a common core idea: that the development of technology itself follows a path strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology consequently causes “effects” on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
We could, for example, say that with the development of the car, roads will certainly develop as well.
It is not economically justifiable to maintain a national road network for just a few cars, therefore new ways of manufacturing are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn drives the development of new medical techniques to care for injured bodies.
Cultural determinism, which drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was an important element of Romanticism.
In the case of romance, individuals were shaped by their geographical affiliation, and over time, customs and culture also emerged, linked to specific geographical areas, which existed in harmony with the state of society and were thus better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris today is renowned as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation, by which he was marked as a center of luxury, became established around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status declined somewhat in the twelfth century, as Crusaders returned home laden with gifts of silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
During this time, the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At the beginning, the dress had a strong hint of Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to slow communication links, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, a distinct style began to develop in Western Europe. One of the greatest advancements of that time, and a result of the Crusades, was the beginning of using buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sufficiency farming is a term used for agriculture with the purpose of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple, often organic system that utilizes saved seeds originating from the same ecological region, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to ensure the best possible yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards, and allow them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can differ according to the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture recognizable can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to start with a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their upbringing due to neglect, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse.
Children like these are called "wolf children" or feral children. Some wolf children were confined by people (usually their parents); this form of child abuse was, in some cases, a result of parents rejecting a child’s severe mental or physical disability.
Before being abandoned or running away, feral children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma in their early childhood.
Others were said to raise animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When feral children are fully raised by non-human animals, their behavior (within physical limitations) becomes almost identical to that of the animal caregivers, for example, fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should, admittedly, be easier and more interesting, but scraping goes a step further.
Shadowing isn't a learning method, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stages can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of reflection, but so is a small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stages are an internal part of the software and are intended to ask questions, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too challenging for a student to tackle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that isn’t stimulating, loving, and educational, yet it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care was supposed to provide all the essential necessities they lacked in the home from which they had previously been removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet enable new dimensions in terms of usage and approaches to rewarding.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” were thought to be important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” as new aspects of motivation when studying how audiences respond to websites.
Recording videos has enabled significant discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
They especially say that with the correct interpretation of microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks explained in his article "The President's Speech" that people who cannot understand speech due to brain injury are nevertheless able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, also possess such abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research from the twentieth century shows that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination redistribute variations back and forth between the two sets with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to humans struggles to meet its amino acid needs with the plant-based resources available in the savanna.
Furthermore, if these needs cannot be met, serious consequences arise: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant-based sources of protein would be those found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates – including us – to digest if not cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also a source of high-quality protein, containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that is, to some extent, similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is a process in which you intentionally wake up during your usual sleep time and fall back asleep shortly after (after 10 to 60 minutes).
You can achieve this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will rouse you, but not fully wake you.
If you find yourself hitting the snooze button repeatedly, you can place your alarm clock across the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other methods based on biorhythms include drinking a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to wake up and go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace an individual possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force is present. Every person has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only obstacle on the path to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but also draws on the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is fundamentally very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga, with its yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations, allows for the awakening of kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment).
The central Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Because Germany was a common enemy during World War II, the USSR and the USA began to cooperate. After the war ended, systemic, procedural, and cultural contradictions led to a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and they truly fought, with the help of proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, with retreat and redeployment at the Romanian bridgehead being their only hope.
These plans became obsolete practically overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union marched in and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of eastern Polish regions, which was in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the mission of navies has been to ensure a state retains the ability to move its people and goods while limiting the enemy’s ability to do the same.
One such recent case, perhaps the most noteworthy, was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. To help Britain, the Americans attempted to bring men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy primarily wanted to stop this type of traffic with U-boats.
If the Allied forces had failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in occupying Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and were often cared for by goat herders, who were frequently children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known sheep herders. These herd management practices are still used today.
In England, railway tracks were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were made only of parallel planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and haul heavier loads than on the somewhat poorer roads of the time.
Pretty soon they began using thresholds to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, they discovered that the rails were more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
This became a common practice, but the wooden wheels on the wagons wore out more quickly due to the iron.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known mode of transportation; people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (or upright man).
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, usually didn't walk upright.
Features of bipedal walking are present in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2–3.9 million years ago, but the hominid Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
Our lives can become more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental protection movement, we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This is in many cases similar to treating symptoms. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is perfectly clear that the world has changed dramatically due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and problems have also increased due to overpopulation and humanity’s wasteful lifestyle.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
At night, they produced between 150 and 200 copies, known as "Dunlap flyers."
John Nixon first read the document publicly on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. One copy reached London on August 10th.
There are still 25 Dunlap broadsides remaining, considered the oldest surviving copies of the document, as the handwritten original has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't recognize them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
Despite everything, birds still share many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these two digits are called binary digits – or bits, if we use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning isn't always the most obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis isn't possible.
The main sign indicating internal poisoning is the possible presence of open packaging of medications or poisonous household chemicals.
On the label, check if specific first aid instructions are listed specifically for this poison.
Entomologists officially use the term "bugs" for this group of insects.
This expression originates from prehistoric connections with mites, highly evolved human parasites.
Both bird mites and dust mites are nesting animals adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, specifically the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
The couple may decide that caring for the child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to assume the role of the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works using the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
And that's not all, testing is also an important part of scientific research, where a test is a procedure designed to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and observe.
Naturalists and philosophers devoted themselves to classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views have been established in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the Western world cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Most observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often fundamentally dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
Repeating rhythms, not merely responses to periodic external stimuli, have been recorded in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue periods of uninterrupted cyclic repetitions even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into bacteria using bacteriophages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments where they labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can be very diverse, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether germ cells are affected.
Only mutations in germ cells can be inherited by offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Field activities include, among other things, hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Such an example is observing, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
People leave their small rural towns in cars every morning to get to work, passing those who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic vehicle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on personal cars.
Science now shows that a massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that have supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone in the company participates and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints regarding water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about the transport systems, why do they fail every day? Is the incompetence of traffic engineers to blame? Or is it perhaps something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, as driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior is generally somewhat established, therefore traffic flows are also established and can be roughly represented in a mathematical form.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of roadways.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Thanks to their ability to fly, they were better at avoiding enemies and more efficiently searching for food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them even more opportunities to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings flat against their bodies are dragonflies and mayflies.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite – that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, since we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and simultaneously the largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon, whose stretches are up to six miles wide, is also the widest river on Earth.
As much as 20 percent of the water from rivers around the planet that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the pyramids at Giza and the technical expertise of their construction were never surpassed.
During the New Kingdom period, the Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The Vatican has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the fewest residents.
In Vatican City, legislation and official communication are in Italian.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most workers in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to mine with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Essentially, they were more four states of matter (in the same sequential order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he claimed they transform into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, metals like silver and gold are also here.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that you could fit trillions of them into the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a dear friend to many upon its invention.
Unfortunately, new writing methods emerged and the pencil was relegated to the sidelines.
People now write messages on computer screens and don't even come close to using a pen.
We can only wonder what keyboards will become when something newer appears.
A fission bomb works by requiring energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similarly to pushing a heavy stroller uphill. Some of that energy is then released through nuclear fission.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they typically decay on their own or with very little assistance.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
On the near side, the crust is approximately 70 km thick, while on the far side it is 100 km thick.
Under the seas it is thinner, but under the highlands it is thicker.
There could be more seas on the near side, as the crust is thinner. Lava rose to the surface more easily.
Theories about content focus on finding what drives people or what pleases them.
These theories state that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow up.
These theories investigate what drives some people to want the things they want, and what environmental factors will lead them to do – or not do – certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivation theory.
When managers start leading their former colleagues, it is generally believed that they can begin to behave in one of two ways. On the one hand, there is an effort to remain “one of the guys” (or girls).
Such a leader struggles to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary measures, evaluate employee performance, assign tasks, and demand accountability for mistakes made.
On the other hand, we can become unrecognizable individuals who think they need to change everything the team has done and chart their own course.
Ultimately, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the group.
Due to such behavior, gaps often form between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams strive for the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are slight differences.
Virtual group members often act as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They usually have more freedom than regular team members, as their teams need to adapt to more time zones, which their local leadership sometimes doesn't understand.
Another characteristic of a virtual team is the presence of a true “invisible group” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109).
"The 'Invisible Team' is the leadership team to which individual members report. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member individually."
Why would an organization undergo the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? Transferring the concepts of organizational learning into practice, among other things, aims to foster innovation.
When the functioning departments of an organization effectively utilize available resources, creativity and ingenuity can begin to flourish.
Through collaboration within the organization to overcome obstacles, a new, innovative process can emerge that will satisfy customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, its leadership must establish an innovative environment and encourage shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the research field and significantly increase its accuracy.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the hypotheses in scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain cognitive functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
With this, we gain a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand how processes unfold in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong association with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in the field of AI encompasses the creation of machines for automating tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate branches focused on providing solutions to real-world problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they are integrated into numerous software programs for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of every lesson. Teachers would often gladly take students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution by conducting virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire art right in the classroom.
Publishing the excursion report online is also an excellent way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital every year, redesigning the site annually, but older versions remain online and serve as a memory album.
Blogs can help students improve their writing style. Although most students begin blogging with superficial grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Because students can often be the most demanding audience, a blogger starts striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, writing blogs "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to attract public attention inspires students to want to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Maintaining a weblog is a tool that encourages student collaboration and effort to learn, even when they are not in school.
Appropriate use of blogs “can encourage students to think more analytically and critically; by consistently responding to online material, students can determine their position in relation to the entries of others and shape their views on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada and boasts numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Somewhat to the south are Niagara Falls, while to the north we find the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and its hinterland.
All of this and much more puts the province of Ontario in the spotlight as something foreigners consider typically Canadian.
Vast areas ahead to the north are sparsely populated, with some areas being almost uninhabited wilderness.
The comparison of populations is surprising to many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than citizens of Canada.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most distinct continent, when considering its animal and plant life.
Smaller islands are mostly independent states or are associated with France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this territory, which became firmly established on the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
The beginning of European influence and colonization dates back to the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route from Europe to India around Africa.
The region in the north borders the Sahel, and in the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: we advise all female travelers to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (but not one that already looks very valuable).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can create the impression of harassment, and it's not unusual for them to be followed, have their hand grabbed, etc.
Firmly reject male entitlement and don't be afraid to defend your position (this is unacceptable, regardless of cultural differences).
Modern Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was later used as a strategic port under the name Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan sultan as Dar al-Baya, but the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it’s not hard to find places selling traditional Moroccan delicacies, such as tagines, pottery and leather goods, water pipes, and a wide range of trinkets, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is sufficiently safe, excursions outside of Goma need to be explored to understand the conflicts ongoing in the North Kivu province.
This city is also a starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the best opportunities for gorilla trekking in Africa.
After Goma, you can travel by bodo-bodo (taxi – motorcycle). For a short ride at the usual (local) price, you will pay around 500 Congolese francs.
Because it is also quite difficult to access, "Timbuktu" is used as another name for exotic, faraway lands.
Despite its fame as a tourist attraction and having an airport, Timbuktu is today a impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the danger of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s PBS special "Wonder of the African World."
This city is completely different from other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic feel than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different group of wildlife and vegetation.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
A daily conservation fee and park entrance fee must be paid, just like in any South African national park.
Perhaps it would be unwise to buy Wild Card passes, which provide access to selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is where the territory of Hong Kong is named, and it is a major destination for many tourists.
The variety of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong are connected by a glittering columnar chart, emphasized by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, go to the island and head to the opposite Kowloon shore.
Urban development on Hong Kong’s islands is largely concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This city was seized by British colonialists as their own, so it's a good starting point for seeing the remnants of the colonial past of this area, if you are interested.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
And these forests are not just mangrove swamps – they include some of the last surviving remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², about a third of which is covered by water/wetland areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are currently around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and to Džakar/Bumthang, run from 6:30 to 7:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts offer small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and reliable.
By sharing taxis, you can quickly and comfortably travel to nearby towns, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two passages that are 3.5 meters wide.
The bridge stands 15 meters high. It was built in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge was expected to become operational in September 2017, coinciding with the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani, who lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming, were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the territory of present-day eastern Paraguay.
In the Chaco region, other groups of indigenous tribes also lived, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who sustained themselves through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, sometimes referred to as the "Great Indian Province," developed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous inhabitants.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the city of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its own character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
You can watch smaller tournaments and matches throughout the year.
You can find news about tournaments and information on purchasing tickets for polo matches at the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), and its value is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted practically on all islands, while in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also widely accepted.
On outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but they may accept British and American currency; inquire with the owners in advance about which payment methods are accepted.
The Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange off the islands, so exchange your cash before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in a subtropical zone; in summer, temperatures often exceed +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but due to a combination of wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of people, wild animals are still wild, and therefore should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, please remain at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
Bison, elk, moose, bears, and practically all large animals can attack, no matter how tame they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so leave them alone.
In addition, you should know that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so do not wear or cook food with strong smells and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggles for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the murder of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland stretches across two harbors, there are many coastlines here. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches in North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie along the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are mostly sandy and safe for swimming, and are typically dotted with New Zealand pohutukawa Christmas trees, which provide shade.
The Tamaki Drive coastal strip is located in Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that can get crowded sometimes, with a good selection of shops surrounding the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which isn't complex, but a pleasant and refreshing beer. Another local beer is called "Manta".
You can enjoy a variety of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines will likely travel better.
The tap water there is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're concerned.
Australians perceive “coffee with milk” as something foreign. A short black coffee is “espresso”, cappuccino is served with a generous amount of cream (not foamed milk), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Throughout the year, many hikers venture onto the ridge, yet injuries resulting from any of these causes are rare on the ridge.
Despite this, follow the instructions of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Moon jellyfish come near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be observed outside of this timeframe.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actually live in the ocean; their original habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
With a prior reservation, a traveler ensures they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their chosen destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, all adjustments and requests should first be communicated to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most believe it’s a key part of the experience.
If you want to be in the heart of the action, you need to get there early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Even though the music on the main stages may quiet down, it’s worth considering that music could still be playing late into the night at some of the festival venues.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to where the cabin is located, as breaking through the ice creates a rather terrifying sound for the most sensitive.
Cruises from Saint Petersburg include a stop in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
Their offer usually includes food, drinks, and entertainment to amuse visitors and keep them around for as long as possible.
At some locations, alcoholic beverages are included in the price. However, intoxication affects judgement, and good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or across mountain passes must be prepared for the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snow-covered roads, grip is poor and you can't drive as you would on dry asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or snow carried by the wind, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are commonplace in many countries, and traffic generally flows smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in everyday use refers to a land journey where we observe African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and can be well observed with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you will be able to see them more easily with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "jungle walk", "hiking safari" or "trekking") refers to a hike that can last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events were held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympic Games twice, having hosted them first in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most cancellation policies related to coronavirus from late March do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
As expected, most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost approximately 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes dries them faster. Many hotels loan out irons and ironing boards if they are not already present in the room.
If you don't have an iron handy, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the goods (as this can cause them to shrink or even become discolored).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, it’s better to buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are unfamiliar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause sensitivities, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, release toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person with force are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is a possibility to purchase goods that are exempt from tax and excise duties in certain locations.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo – Pittsburgh Turnpike, as it frequently crosses isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on gravel roads, be careful, as steep slopes, narrow paths, and sharp turns prevail.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections, typically ranging from 35 to 40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h), and strict adherence to the limits is even more important than usual.
Surprisingly, the mobile signal is much stronger here than on many other sections of the trail, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, but in Bavaria they are rather rich and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are quite common, as cooked apples in pastries can be found throughout the year, while cherries and plums are typically enjoyed in the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts are also typical ingredients in most German pastries. Popular cakes are particularly enjoyable with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a pastry that is small but rich, try something called a Berliner, pancake, or donut, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Indonesian food is a general term for a wide variety of dishes found throughout the country, which boasts over 17,000 islands.
However, the term "vegan" without further specification generally refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, is characterized by a variety of simply seasoned dishes, with the dominant flavors that Javanese people adore being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang on each side of the saddle.
They offer riders greater stability, but can also pose a safety issue, as a rider's legs can get caught in them.
If a horse throws a rider and the rider's foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse could drag them along if it bolts. To reduce this risk, we can consider a variety of safety measures.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety releases that allow the leather stirrup bar to fall away from the saddle if the rider pulls back on it during a fall.
Cochamó Valley – a leading climbing destination in Chile with diverse, large granite walls and cliffs, often called the Yosemite of South America.
The peaks of the ridges offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are still establishing new routes in its walls with endless potential.
Snow sports involving skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that include descending snowy terrain with skis or a board attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major activity for travelers with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "roaming skiers," as they plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: this activity is also called ski touring or ski mountaineering.
Although it doesn't usually include elements of these disciplines, it is similar to backcountry alpine skiing or mountaineering, which are practiced on steep terrain and require harder boots and skis.
Imagine a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good weather conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking – but you will rarely achieve the speed of touring skiing without a heavy backpack and groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to apply for a visa multiple times and undergo passport checks.
The Schengen Area, in this regard, functions somewhat like a single country.
Within this area, you can cross borders without going through checkpoints again where you would have to show your passport.
If you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen area member state separately, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition determining which products are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition varies depending on the geographic region, as the age limit can be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antique items, even though they are newer than comparable mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding this industry is also important for other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami herded reindeer on a large scale, but rather made a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily for transport.
Today, many Sámi work in modern industries. Tourism represents an important source of income in the Sápmi region, the area inhabited by the Sámi people.
Although the word "cigan" is often used, especially among non-Roma people, it is frequently understood as offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel advice, it may affect your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
Perhaps you might also want to seek advice from a government that isn't yours, but whose advice is shaped for its citizens.
For American citizens, the situation in the Middle East will, for example, be different than for Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in each country.
The presented viewpoints are often superficial, generalized, and simplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions is a general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage, serious disruption to society, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather events can occur anywhere in the world, and we recognize several different types, which depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Forms and consequences of extreme weather events include strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather disasters include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of any possible extreme weather conditions in the area, as these may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should obtain professional training.
If you search for "hostile environment training" online, you will most likely get the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues mentioned here in much more detail, typically along with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid procedures, and occasional weapons handling training.
Books and magazines about surviving in nature are widespread, but there are only a handful of publications about war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
Not all governments are willing to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents with updated information regarding preferred name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents also varies.
Security checks have become much more intrusive in the period following September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals should not expect to undergo assessment without some invasion of privacy and with their dignity fully intact before surgery.
Rip currents are currents that flow away from the shore, often returning from breaking waves, typically on sandbars or similar features.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid downward current can form there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while swimming back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you manage to get out of the current, swimming back won’t be any different from usual.
Try to steer yourself somewhere you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, wait for rescuers.
The shock of returning home happens sooner than culture shock (there isn't such a long honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your native culture.
When you were abroad for the first time, people were likely patient and understanding, as they knew that travelers need to get used to a new country.
Perhaps people don't expect that passengers returning home also need to be patient and understanding.
The sound and light show with pyramids is one of the most exciting things for children in the area.
Before the performance begins, you can view the pyramids in darkness and silence.
Usually, you can always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is like a fairytale.
The Sphinx represents the backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are depicted on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, fall under the jurisdiction of several nations and have the most research stations, 16 of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, these include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a flooded caldera of a still-active volcano serves as a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a landmass south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here into a plateau, then rise again as the 360-km-long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range, the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, are located, with Mount Vinson rising 4,892 m high.
In remote areas without mobile signal, you may only be able to rely on a satellite phone.
A satellite phone usually cannot replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
This service is frequently used in maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as in expeditions requiring remote data and voice services.
Your local telephone service provider can provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is traveling and learning.
It is particularly popular with students in their final years, as it offers them a gap year before starting their studies without having to sacrifice their education.
It often happens that education during a year abroad actually increases the likelihood of an individual continuing their studies in their home country.
Usually, tuition fees are required to participate in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. In addition, the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast.
You don't need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Rowing is the national sport of Finland, as every seventh or eighth person owns a boat.
It's the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite rare (for example, the ratio in the Netherlands is one to forty).
Most special Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that when visiting the historic city, you can spend several days there during the day, and return to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore on ship excursions, you won't need a special visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some cruises mentioned in brochures list Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience, regardless of how old people are or where they come from, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic experience.
There's no need to be ashamed of this, as it's no different from personal fear and resistance to other things that trouble many people.
If they understand even a little about how airplanes work and what happens during flight, it can help some overcome the fear that stems from the unknown or lack of control.
Courier services are well-paid for the fast delivery of goods. Often, with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs, time is of the essence.
Larger companies have their own planes for some routes, but a problem has arisen for other routes and smaller businesses.
If they ship goods via air freight, it can take several days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to get them through faster is to send them as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
An obvious way to fly in first or business class is to dig deep into your pocket for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
That’s not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more for business class than for economy class, and eleven times more for first class!
On direct flights from point A to point B, it generally doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on business or first class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language is Romanian, and Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been shaken by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite failed political negotiations, economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, with a population of around 3.7 million, is the third-largest city in Turkey, being the second-largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and vibrant business center, clustered around a gigantic bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide avenues, buildings with glass facades and a modern shopping centre are accompanied by traditional tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more European Mediterranean atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and is also home to an unusual octagonal church.
On some graves in the churchyard, there are interesting marble dove statues.
It's worth sacrificing half an hour for a walk through this interesting village.
To the north and quite accessible is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which gained fame among foreigners when Lord Byron wrote such a brilliant description of its beauties.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops in Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can also visit the beautiful Shrine of Mary in Fatima (a holy site), a place of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Keep in mind that you are actually on a mass grave site, as well as a place that holds almost unimaginable significance for a large portion of the world’s population.
Many men and women who spent their time there are still alive, but far more are those whose loved ones were murdered there or worked there to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Act with dignity, seriousness, and respect, as is proper. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the area by marking or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone also knows how to speak Spanish.
Most signs are only in Catalan, which is legally designated as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, while unexpected disruptions are communicated in various languages through an automated system, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, you'll still get the best results in Paris by practicing good manners – by behaving as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make your trip significantly easier.
The apparent aloofness of Parisians will quickly fade if you show some basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily overgrown with forests, primarily beech, spruce, and fir, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to its diverse microclimates, varied soils, and altitude, it is known for a wide range of plant communities.
This area provides a home for numerous different species of animals and birds.
Here you can encounter rare animals such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, as well as numerous more common species.
Women must wear skirts that reach below the knees when visiting monasteries, and they must also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries offer cloaks to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it’s brightly colored, you’ll make the monk or nun at the entrance smile.
Similarly, men must also wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow these at the entrance, but you should know that they aren’t washed after each use, so they might not be the most comfortable to wear. A universal size is available for men.
Majorcan cuisine, like the cuisines of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dish, especially in summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and all sorts of toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, except for the word "Sie" for "you," always begin with a capital letter, even mid-sentence.
This is an important way of distinguishing certain verbs and objects.
Furthermore, it should also facilitate reading, although this makes writing somewhat more difficult, as one needs to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in its basic form.
The pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You should pay particular attention to the letters c and g, as their pronunciation differs depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, make an effort to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively simple and quite regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand idioms.
It goes without saying that you will learn Portuguese more easily if you already know a Romance language.
Those who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to it that it doesn’t need to be learned separately.
Observatories from the pre-modern era are now obsolete and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution wasn't such a problem in their golden age as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses and are more accessible than those built later.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, or *hanami*, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originated in China, where Japanese apricots were the most common choice for blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were hosted by the emperor, who organized them for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick a specimen, even if it's "just one".
When visiting a formally arranged garden, you will be kicked out without debate for collecting "specimens."
Singapore is generally a very safe city and easy to navigate, and upon arrival you can buy almost anything.
In the “scorching tropics,” just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll have to contend with the heat (constantly) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which doesn’t happen often).
Some buses also run north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good common thread for organizing a trip.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube, or perhaps boating on the Erie Canal.
They are also used as popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many customs associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers from Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
Traditionally, Easter night should be spent in an exposed location, waiting for the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring ritual and a fertility rite.
In more traditional churches, during the Easter weekend, an Easter vigil often takes place on Saturday night, where the choral singing frequently transitions into a celebration of Christ’s resurrection at midnight.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands swam, flew, or sailed here.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, which is why the giant tortoise is the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, they have introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
You will have a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as it is dark for most of the day during that period.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and there is generally no light pollution, you will also be able to admire the stars.
The work culture in Japan is perhaps more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
The attire is standard business formal, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
At the workplace, harmony is essential, with collective effort being more important than celebrating individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain approval from their superiors for every decision and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
