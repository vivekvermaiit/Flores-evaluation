This is a difficult sentence, and a truly accurate translation requires deep cultural understanding of Fon proverbs and speech patterns. However, here's a translation striving for both accuracy and readability: "The world is full of challenges; when a person is burdened with troubles, they seek help from others, but ultimately, it is through their own efforts and wisdom that they overcome them – no one can truly carry another's burden for them." **Explanation of choices & difficulties:** * **"Ye lɛ kpo ɖò tintɛnkpɔn wɛ..."** – Literally "The world is full of difficulties/challenges..." This sets a general tone of life being hard. * **"...ba tunwun bà e mɛ mɔ lɛ gba sɔ e..."** – This speaks to seeking help when troubled. "Tunwun" refers to people, and the phrase conveys asking for assistance. * **"...kpo ali e nu wùwú ɔ na wanù dò ayikungban ɔ wu dó e."** – This is the core of the proverb. It emphasizes self-reliance. "Ayikungban" signifies wisdom/skill and "wanù dò" means to strive or put forth effort. The final part reinforces that one ultimately carries their own burden. The structure is very idiomatic. It's crucial to remember that Fon proverbs often have layers of meaning and context that are hard to capture perfectly in a direct translation. This version aims to convey the *meaning* and *spirit* of the original Fon sentence.

This is a difficult sentence to translate accurately without more context, as Fon relies heavily on tone and cultural understanding. However, here's the best possible translation based on the words provided, aiming for meaning rather than a strictly literal rendering: “Truly, Steven Tyler’s song is good; it makes people dance and jump with joy, especially young girls. It’s a very beautiful and exciting song.” **Explanation of challenges and choices made:** * **"Ée hanjitɔ́ dodó Steven Tyler gble wǔ hwenu"**: This likely means "Truly, Steven Tyler's song is good/beautiful." "Hanjitɔ́" can mean song, and "dodó" often implies truth or certainty. “Gble wǔ hwenu” implies it’s pleasing or well-made. * **"e é j'ayǐ ɖ'agunmɛ ɖò nǔxúxo gɛnnyigɛnnyi ɖe hwenu"**: This is the core action part - “It makes people dance and jump with joy.” "ayǐ" is people, "agunmɛ" dance, "nǔxúxo" joy/happiness, "gɛnnyigɛnnyi" jump. * **"ɖ'azǎn 5 gɔ Wǒsùn ɔ́ tɔ́n e ɔ́"**: This refers to "especially young girls." "azǎn" means young, and Wǒsùn likely refers to girls (context dependent). * **"yě lɛ gbɛ́ tomɛ yiyi ɔ"**: This emphasizes the song's quality, translating to "It’s a very beautiful and exciting song." “Tomɛ” denotes something beautiful or good, and “yiyi” implies excitement or vibrancy. **Important Note:** Fon translation is *highly* context-dependent. A more precise translation would require knowing the situation in which this sentence was spoken.

(This is the most complex part and relies on interpretation of idiomatic expression) * **ɔ nɔn yahu jo éɖo (ɖo Nǔ Vɛ Nu Hydrogen nǔ vi awhé jin wɛ ɖé mɛ):** To know many things (studying Hydrogen helps us to know many things).

This is a difficult sentence, rich in cultural context and nuance. Here's a translation attempting to capture the meaning as accurately as possible, keeping in mind Fon often uses indirectness: “We went to Kanlin, and we offered sacrifices, hoping for its blessing, but it didn’t work. We tried everything – two by two, constantly pleading – but still faced hardship. It’s as if even offering two strong goats wasn’t enough to appease it; even those offerings didn't bring the desired outcome or protection from misfortune.” **Important Considerations & Explanations of Choices:** * **"Do ba nu nǔ tɔ́ lɛ́ lin ɖɔ Kanlin"**: Literally "We went and went to worship Kanlin." This is understood as a pilgrimage or seeking aid from the deity Kanlin. * **"vǔ asé ɖɔhun"**: "Offer sacrifices hoping for blessing/help." *Ase* is often tied to spiritual power or a positive outcome. * **"nɔ jɛ kanlin lɛ gudo bó nɔ́ mɔ yě koò wǎn"**: This is where the pleading and persistence come in. "We kept begging Kanlin, constantly doing everything we could to avoid being prey/suffering." *Wan* here represents misfortune or being vulnerable. * **"tuun tuun tɔn kpó bó nɔ́ hwɛ́n"**: “Two by two we pleaded relentlessly.” *Tɔn* can mean ‘strength’ or emphasis and repeated with *tuun* suggests persistent effort. * **"awɔntín ayi gbọn fí e afɔdo yětɔn gbɔn ɖò kɔ́mɛ lɛ e"**: This is the crucial point about the offering of goats. "Even two strong, healthy goats weren't enough to satisfy it.” It highlights that even significant sacrifices didn’t yield the desired results, suggesting Kanlin was either unwilling or unable to help. *Ayi* is a classifier for animals, and the description emphasizes the quality of the goats. **Disclaimer:** Fon translation is complex. Variations exist based on dialect and context. This is the most accurate translation based on my expertise and understanding of the language and culture.
This is a difficult sentence, rich in cultural context and nuance. Here's a translation aiming for accuracy and readability, acknowledging some inherent ambiguity due to the nature of translation: “Indeed, this is a good story; it’s a story that makes people happy and brings blessings.

Here's a translation attempting to capture the nuances, keeping in mind Fon often uses circumlocution: “The news is very good; it has brought great joy to my heart, and because of this joy, I am offering libations and prayers to the ancestors, hoping they will continue to protect and bless me, and may their words always be true for me.” **Important Notes on the Translation Choices:** * **"Aglan tɔn găga"**: Literally "news is good," but "very good news" conveys the intensity better. * **"ɔ hein aɖu ɖíɖa nûmɛ̆n kaka sɔyi"**: This is the core of the emotional impact - it’s about joy reaching the heart. “brought great joy to my heart” tries to capture that. * **"ka ɖé gban cobɔ ɖévoé ɖévoé lɛ́ gɔnan"**: This is where the ritual offering comes in. "offering libations and prayers" is the closest equivalent. “Ancestors” is implied by the context of *cobɔ* and *dévoé*. * **"bo gɔ nûn tɔn mɛ bí, nǔ é zɔn bɔ nǔ ɖebǔ man nɔ nɔn nǔkɔn ní an nɛ"**: This is a complex clause asking for continued protection and truthfulness. The translation attempts to convey the hope that the ancestors' blessings and words remain steadfast. Without more context, this is the best possible translation. Fon is a tonal language, and nuance is heavily reliant on tone and the overall situation.

This is a difficult sentence, and a truly perfect translation requires deep cultural understanding of Fon proverbs and phrasing. However, here's a translation aiming for accuracy and natural English, along with explanations of choices made where necessary: **"A child who doesn't listen is like a stubborn donkey; no matter how much advice you give, they won't heed it, and eventually, their foolishness will lead them to a difficult path – a path they themselves chose."** **Explanation of choices/difficulties:** * **Wlɛnwlìn ɔ nyɔ:** Literally "child who doesn't listen." This sets up the core comparison. * **bó sɛn nù tidó kpataki ahwanfùtɔ kpó:** This is the core of the "stubborn donkey" metaphor. *Ahwanfùtɔ* is donkey. *Kpó* signifies stubbornness/hardness. "No matter how much you advise..." is implied by *bó sɛn nù tidó*. * **mɛ e ma nyi ahwanfùtɔ kpó tɔn:** "...they won't heed/listen to the donkey's stubbornness." This reinforces the comparison – the child *embodies* the stubbornness. * **sɔmɔ aliglɔnù mɛ e lɔ da dó sɛn mɛ bǐ yi gbè:** "Eventually, their foolishness will lead them..." *Sɔmɔ* means foolishness. *Aliglɔnù* refers to a bad path or consequence. * **na ɔ ɖó xwè kanwekó gùdó tɔn e wayi lɛ tɔn:** "...a path they themselves chose." *Kanwekó* refers to one's own actions/choices. *Wayi lɛ tɔn* emphasizes that this is *their* decision/path. It’s important to note that Fon often uses imagery and proverbs to convey meaning, so a strictly literal translation wouldn't capture the nuance. This translation prioritizes conveying the *meaning* of the sentence in a natural English way.

This translation leans into that interpretation. * **Cultural Context**: The repeated building and destruction suggests resilience in the face of adversity, a common theme in Fon oral tradition. * **"kpoɖo nû wiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpo"**: This closing phrase is a plea for collective effort and sustainability.

This is a difficult sentence with nuanced cultural context. Here's the most accurate translation I can provide, keeping in mind Fon often relies on implication and doesn't always have direct English equivalents: "They say this is good, they say it doesn’t cause problems; it brings blessings to those who use it, and it’s a good thing to share with others so that its goodness will continue. (This visa brings blessings and good fortune)." **Explanation of challenges & choices made:** * **"Yé lɛ hɛn ɔ"**: "They say this is good." "Yé" signifies general speech/people saying something. "Hɛn" implies a positive quality (good, well). * **"yé na zé tɛnmɛ ɔ"**: “They say it doesn’t cause problems”. “Zé tɛnmɛ” means “doesn’t have problems/difficulty”. * **"ɖ'ayi nu mi nú mi ba na lɛ lín tamɛ kpɔn kpɛɖé aló nu mi jlo na lɛ yi ba"**: This is a complex section about blessings and sharing. It essentially means it benefits those who use it and is good to share so the benefits continue. I’ve aimed for a flowing, natural English equivalent. * **"wema ɖevo lɛ ɖò fí e mi xwè e ji e"**: This describes the lasting effect and good fortune. "Wema" is blessing/goodness. The rest emphasizes the continuation of that goodness. * **"(ɖi viza wema ɔ ɖɔhun)"**: This is a clarifying statement: "(This visa brings blessings and good fortune)." – clarifying the context is likely about a visa. **Important Note:** Fon translation can be heavily context-dependent. Without knowing the specific situation where this sentence was uttered, some nuances might be lost.

It's vital to remember that Fon is a tonal language, and subtle changes in tone can dramatically alter meaning. Without audio, this is the best possible translation based on the written form.

Fon relies heavily on cultural understanding and nuance. This is the closest equivalent I can offer given the isolated sentence.
