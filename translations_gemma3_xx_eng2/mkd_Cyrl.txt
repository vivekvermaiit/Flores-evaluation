Although one experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce mortality from Ebola, there are currently no drugs that have clearly been shown to be effective in treating an existing infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promising results in that area, but formal studies revealed it lacked the necessary benefits to prevent death.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other therapies to it.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had cloacas, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional appearance.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were bone-brown at the top, and the underside was pale or carotenoid in color.
The finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – soft filaments and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis likely represented a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but for thermoregulation or display. Researchers pointed out that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not those like on a bird.
Researchers pointed out that, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the specimen displays mature feathers, not those like on a chicken.

The accomplished work is mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observing the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team expects should be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon influences Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way influence the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a halo, and is composed of many small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not constant like in the large caves on Earth, where a fairly constant temperature is often maintained, but is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glenn Cushing from the team of astrogeologists at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and from the University of North Carolina located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot with their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the authorities verify the voter's identity, they drop the ballot into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
The French electoral law sometimes strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside them at the start of voting and that no other envelopes will be added, except those from properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Besides the event on Wednesday, Karpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
First was the Slalom, where she didn't finish the first run. 36 out of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her next race, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Jingyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's seated group did not finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
The police in Madja Pradesh found and returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D.K. Arya said, “We arrested five individuals who raped a woman from Switzerland and returned her mobile phone and laptop.”
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampo Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shehar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the traffic accident occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then they transferred him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja has since appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any evidence from witnesses could be called into question as her image has been published everywhere.
This is common practice throughout the United Kingdom, but the Scottish legal system is different and courts consider publishing images to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that “it really looks like journalists are walking a fine line if they publish photos etc. of suspects.”
The Public Prosecutor's Office, which has full jurisdiction over prosecution, informed journalists that no further comments would be given, at least until an indictment is filed.
According to the source, the document pertains to the border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to be returned to those of the period before the 1967 Middle East war.
Like other topics, reportedly, the future state of Jerusalem, which is a holy place for both peoples, and the dispute over the Jordan River Valley are also being discussed.
Israel is seeking a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of 10 years after a deal is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control test should have been under strict supervision by rangers, as the test was observed and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
According to the hunting program of the Association of Sports Hunters, in cooperation with NPWS and the Australian Association of Sports Hunters (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation of Parks and Heritage at NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martovski yesterday received oaths for a new nine-member Temporary Electoral Commission (SEC).
This is the fifth Temporary Election Commission in Martelly in 4 years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed that SER resign beforehand as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
With the Martelli commission, they actually responded to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, and some date back as far as 2011.
Around 60 cases of faulty iPod devices that overheat have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced they had received notification from Apple of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company considers “not serious.”
In its response, the Ministry called Apple's report delay "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM (9:19 AM GMT Friday).
Representatives of the Office of Emergency Management on the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage was reported on the islands.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers replaced him with an older woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She studied to become a midwife and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Ligins began researching preterm labor in his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone is administered, the maturation of the fetal lungs in a baby would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, or "black boxes," on Wednesday.
The moon was also honored by fellow fighters.
Tomi Drimer said, “Luna was the first Queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two full moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Golddust" Ranels commented that "Luna was as lost as me... maybe even more... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent from 2008.
The acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign asserted that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
34 percent of those surveyed share this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the extremes noted in the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but doubts about his physical fitness have arisen due to his complaints.
He couldn't get the medication he needed to overcome the pain, as it was banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source for delivering water to Earth, in addition to the organic matter that could have created proteins and supported life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, specifically how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a very long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor at the beginning of this year and last month signed the bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims enables aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
He uses technology based on satellite, as opposed to the older technology based on ground radar, to help air traffic controllers more accurately pinpoint aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport has been arranged, and the underground trains will not be stopping at Wembley, with no parking or park-and-ride facilities available near the stadium.
The fear of lacking transportation increased the possibility of the match being held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
Research published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species had evolved in just two generations, despite the belief that this process took much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Galapagos finches, Geospiza fortis and the large cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any form. It can be bent into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be bent and woven. It can be hammered with a hammer or stretched into layers.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handmade pictures in books called "Illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a chemical pH value. An indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which you will feel unusually and will form a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with flushing water in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the cities of the Minoan era on Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
Toilets existed in the ancient states of Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, in some situations toilets were part of public baths where both men and women went together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then rejects it almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A gigantic rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The best thing the wheel did for us is that it enabled easier and faster transportation.
We enabled the train, the car, and many other vehicles.
Beneath them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
In the end, there are many small cats (including pet cats that roam freely) who eat a much larger number of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the domain, a special work that every cat has which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats that live in large groups called prides.
The herd consists of one to three related males, along with a maximum of thirty females and young.
Women are typically closely connected to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pride behaves similarly to a wolf pack or a group of dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, as well as being very deadly to their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of the strongest man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of words resembling ‘neighing and loud shouting’.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing the ground where they have been.
They see beautifully in the darkness with night vision and move stealthily as well. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings, and then snatching their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it migrates across a mountain range or river, or if it colonizes a new island from which it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in an environment different from the one it previously inhabited.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor, compared to what it needed previously.
The initial population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment and starts to resemble the other population less and less.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create oxygen that people breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants produce their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our homes are made from plants, and our clothes are also made from plants. Plants make up the majority of the food we eat. Animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator of its time, and was afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with another row in the upper part of his mouth, meaning there was no escape for whatever stood in his way.
We don’t know for sure, but it’s possible he had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex was no match for him.
Although most of the food is familiar to us, the Romans also had their own strange or unusual delicacies, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting on stools, wealthy people preferred to have communal feasts where they would recline while eating their meals.
Dishes from Ancient Rome certainly did not contain products that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted maize.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of the gods, which was considered the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to serve the gods’ needs through rituals and celebrations.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special elevations in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The peak of the elevation was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Old Jewish family took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just open-air stalls facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no dense forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Old Norse sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and when he travelled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes had already been living there at that time.
Despite the fact that each of the countries was “Scandinavian,” there were numerous differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might believe there's a map to hidden treasure on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Despite the fact that something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are written the words "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776". The text is written upside down and appears at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that initially the large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was wrapped for safekeeping.
So, it's possible the note was simply added as a marker.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the south remained unliberated.
They were governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies entered Southern France, and the invasion was named Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated Southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization represents a distinct culture shaped by a significant large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means "civil," related to the Latin word "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and that somehow defines the size of a society as well.
City-states are the harbingers of nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and a fairly significant expansion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—where the only component was the Congress—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes and, because it had no national executive or judicial branches, relied on state governments – which often did not cooperate – to enforce all of its laws.
Also, he had no authority to reject laws on taxes and customs between states.
The members demanded unanimous consent from all states before any changes could be made, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italian national football, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Isla Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in local grain processing habits and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took over the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely "Intihuatana", "the Temple of the Sun", and "the Room of the Three Windows".
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been renovated to show tourists what they originally looked like.
Until 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the size of film that prevailed at the end of the analog film era.
Today it is still being produced, but more importantly, its ratio is inherited from the sensor formats of images from a digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually quite confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (which is divisible by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equivalent to or significantly approximate ratios.
The most abused and most often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining order in the composition.
It highlights that the most effective approach is to position the main subject at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Roman Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subject to criticism.
Despite the differences in languages and customs, the Christian religion united the European states over a thousand years.
Her sweeping power influenced everyone from the king to the common person.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty, and that church funds are intended solely for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money has led many to question whether the principles are being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began the naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the necessary supplies to the army and civilians, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, thereby causing danger even for neutral vessels.
Because there were few options to respond to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, attitudes of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After the wartime horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to begin working for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a collection of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different historical periods; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a separate dynasty.
Additionally, between each dynasty there was a period of instability with divided provinces. The most famous of these phases was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this period, fierce battles were fought among many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, when thousands of people perished in the struggle to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to all people, not just a single ruler.
Additionally, after the Revolution, job opportunities were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the military, because instead of ranking in the military being based on class, it was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this earthly life. He often went to a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) to contemplate.
He secluded himself in a cave, which had survived through time, offering a vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it’s not at all easy to find, even if someone knew about the fast. Once you enter the cave, it’s complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the multitude of surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or the Giza Necropolis in Egypt’s Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The “upper arc” symbol resembles the letter V, and the “lower arc” symbol resembles a conjunction or a square missing its bottom side.
High means you should start at the top and push the bow, and low means you should start near the frog (where your palm holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Moving the bow upwards produces a softer sound, while moving it downwards results in a louder and more aggressive sound.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember, the printed notes are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forcibly returned to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by crowds of people who were shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows all around.
At one moment, a man from the crowd shook his head at the royal guard killed in Versailles before the frightened queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and the bond interest fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profit obtained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos represented a fundamental gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the order's creation.
The time when these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a broad spectrum of ideas in practice, from technological drive or technological imperative to a strong sense that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology, in and of itself, follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has “influences” on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that motor vehicles inevitably lead to road development.
However, a network of national-level roads is not economically viable for just a few cars, so work is being done on new methods in production to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increased frequency of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for treating injured bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture emerged connected to the geography, so in harmony with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
During this period, the title of Fashion Capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style culminated between the 10th and 11th, and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western fashion could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Existential farming is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seed originating from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
In the past, most farmers practiced agriculture for their own needs, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be diverse as a result of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style encompassing fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is referring to several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, poverty, or deliberate abuse by adults, remained unsocialized while growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (most often by their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was a result of the parents’ rejection of the child’s severe mental or physical disability.
Abused children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are reportedly descended from animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When fully raised by animals, a wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear of or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should facilitate learning and make it more engaging, a technique called "scaffolding" goes a step further.
The technique called “scaffolding” is not a learning method but a support tool that provides assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and are designed to question, prompt, and explain procedures that students may have found too difficult to master on their own.
Children are placed in children's homes or foster families for reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but still, they do.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our care system should provide safe homes, caring guardians, stable education, and a secure healthcare system.
Care should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home they were previously taken from.
The internet contains elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions regarding uses and access to pleasures.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” were proposed as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Both Amy and McCord (1998) identify “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” as new motivational aspects, exploring audience reactions to web pages.
Using video footage led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it may be possible to detect if someone is lying through accurate interpretation of micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book “The President’s Speech,” noted how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain injury are still capable of accurately judging sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has proven that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection allows it to be removed from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shift variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Furthermore, if unsuccessful, there will be serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and pods, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering all the circumstances, we shouldn’t be surprised if our ancestors solved their “protein problem” in much the same way chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is a process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm to rouse you without fully waking you up.
If you happen to stop the alarm clock while asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
The remaining options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known as a diuretic) before bed, causing a person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the pressure, the more positive the present life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing preventing us from reaching our goal is the pressure and negativity from within ourselves.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, which were expanded with the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is “divine yoga.” Through visualization of several deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, differences in systems, processes, and culture led to disagreements between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and be a real struggle, with proxy armies, on war fronts from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive force had already been defeated, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans quickly became outdated overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of the eastern parts of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Shipping goods by boats is definitely the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The job of navies, traditionally, is to ensure your country maintains the ability to transport its people and goods, while simultaneously making it difficult for the enemy to transport theirs.
One of the most important examples of this was recently the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Simultaneously, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was attempting to halt this traffic.
If the Allies had suffered defeat, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain just as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily obtain milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills or pastures, tended by goatherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the better-known shepherds. These rearing methods are still used today.
Horse-drawn trams were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Although mine carts were mainly built from parallel wooden planks, they could be pulled by horses for greater speed and to haul a larger load than could be carried along the poor roads of the time.
Railway ties were used from the very beginning to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually determined that the rails would be more efficient if they had a piece of iron on the upper part.
This became common practice, but iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first train with completely iron wheels was launched.
The first known method of transportation was walking; people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, weren't as accustomed to walking upright.
Bipedal adaptations have been found in australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start treating the environment more kindly, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
In many cases, this is the same as treating the symptoms. However, if a temporary solution isn't all that's sought, then the root of the problems needs to be discovered and eradicated.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological progress of humankind, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
Upon its adoption by Congress, on July 4th, the draft in manuscript, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent several streets away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlop Pages."
John Nixon first publicly read the document in the yard of the Independence Building on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and was read to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy also arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving Danlap documents are the oldest extant copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
In modern times, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. They are called birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and move on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on managing information encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or, if using computer jargon, are called bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open box of medication or household toxic chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense.
This term originates from the ancient resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects well-adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both lice and parasites are nidicolous, adapted to living in nests or dwelling on their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
The couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to make an adoption plan for their baby.
When adopting, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can have parental rights over the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, most scientific research is conducted according to this method.
However, it’s not just that, but also the experimentation—and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses—asking questions, as well as observation, also drive scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, with a particular emphasis on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often significantly depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely reactions to external periodic signals, are documented in the majority of living organisms, encompassing bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue with a period of free cyclic motion even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutated genetic cells can be passed on to children, while mutated cells in any other location can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural landscapes for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the plant and animal life.
Examples of activities at the location include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and pass others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shared transportation system, everyone is connected in some way and supports the transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from its state of stability that sustained human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they disappoint people daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more significant happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because drivers’ behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to adhere to a reasonably consistent framework; therefore, traffic flows tend to exhibit a certain reasonable constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relations help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite—that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, being up to six miles wide in some places.
Full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers around the world into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which by then were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The legislation and official communication of the Vatican are in Italian.
People who work in government use Italian daily, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to excavate with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It’s something like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also believed they transformed into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are actually a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table consists of many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is created from matter. All matter is composed of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil became a good friend to many when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil's status and use have diminished.
People now write messages on the computer and never have to get close to a pencil sharpener again.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
A fission bomb functions on the principle that energy is required to create a core from a multitude of protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then, with the repeated division of the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with or without a small nudge.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the “crust”.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
The soil is thinner under the seas, and thicker under the plains.
There may be more basalt plain on the nearer side because the crust is thinner. Thus, it is easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates people or what they enjoy.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted as they mature from children into adults.
These theories examine what drives some people to enjoy the things they do, and what in their environment will lead them to do or not do certain things.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when leaders begin to manage their former colleagues. On one hand, there's the attempt to remain “one of the guys” (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable for their actions.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who believes they must change everything the team has done and make it according to their own vision.
However, the leader has ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often results in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams operate according to the same standards of excellence as standard teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams because their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a crucial component of a virtual team.
The management team is the "invisible team" to which each member reports. It is precisely the visible team that sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity flourish.
As a result, the organization's collaborative process for overcoming obstacles can lead to a new, innovative process for serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the foundation of scientists' research.
It is well known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This is how a lot of information and materials are provided for creating simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation of science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and user questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
After being incorporated into several software applications for home computers and video games, the VI system is now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Fieldwork is a large part of every classroom. Very often, the teacher would like to take her students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours. Students can examine artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Even virtually sharing field trips is a good way to reminisce about a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital; the website is rebuilt each year, but older versions are preserved online to serve as an album.
Blogs also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with weak grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience largely changes that.
Because students are the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging “forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them.” The need to feed the audience’s interest inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs “can encourage students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others’ written texts, and also highlight their own views on specific issues (Oraveц, 2002).”
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, characterized by a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south lie Niagara Falls, while the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and much more make Ontario the quintessential Canadian province, as foreigners believe.
Large areas to the north are sparsely populated, and parts of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is convincingly the largest and in itself a continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it quickly spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female passengers state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider abuse, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, have your hand caught, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (with or without cultural differences, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badia, but it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases here.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajine dishes, earthenware, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of cheap ornaments, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the most remote parts of the east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be checked to ascertain the unrest situation that persists in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Although the city is a tourist attraction and has an airport, Timbuktu is a poor city today.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sands.
He was one of the main locations during the PBS special program, “Wonders of the African World” by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is a stark contrast to the other cities in the country, because it has more Arabian charm than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of the Republic of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern border.
The park stretches over an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each with a distinct animal life.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered a flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation fees and park entrance fees.
Also, it might be useful for someone to buy a “Wild Card” which allows entry into any park in South Africa or all of the national parks in South Africa.
The name of the territory of Hong Kong originates from Hong Kong Island, and it is the place that is the main focus of many tourists.
The arrangement of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a dazzling graph that stands out with the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To see the best view in Hong Kong, leave the island and head away from the Kowloon shoreline.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
That is the place the British colonizers occupied, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, it is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps – they encompass some of the last remaining strongholds of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Delta.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that around 400 royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer currently live in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day, although most, especially those travelling east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
In most areas, small Japanese minivans are used, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing taxis is a quick and efficient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 Ngultrums) and Punakha (200 Ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction finished in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The plan is for the bridge to be fully functional in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group who lived in present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for sustenance.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Paiagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "Great Province of Southeast Asia," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted for more than three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here you can also watch smaller tournaments and competitions in other parts of the year.
For news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentinian Polo Association (Asociación Argentina de Polo).
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is valued at par with the British pound (GBP).
The currency is exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, directly opposite the "FIT West" store.
British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and American dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards are likely not to be accepted on remote islands, although you may be able to pay with British and American currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable for you.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is located south of the Equator, so it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; temperatures above +30 degrees Celsius are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct "rainy" or "dry" periods: the amount of rainfall remains relatively constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, they are still wild animals, and therefore should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park service guidelines, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how tame they look, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals could attack.
Every year, a dozen visitors are injured because they don’t keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking food with strong odors and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the notorious maritime deadlock occurred at the port when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British warship. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the murder of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Oakland encompasses two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most have shade from the nearby trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the waterfront suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that can get crowded sometimes, with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most famous local beer is called "Nambr Wan," which isn't heavy, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that could be chosen, but wines from New Zealand and Australia travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are cautious.
Australians don’t typically embrace the idea of a “plain white” coffee. A short black coffee is an “espresso,” a cappuccino is served with a lot of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards. Although expensive, the fruit juices are excellent.
Trips to the ridge are frequent throughout the year, and injuries from these trips rarely occur.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appears along beaches and river mouths, from October to April, north of 1770. It can occasionally be encountered outside of this time period as well.
Sharks really do exist, but, regardless, they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and just swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live constantly in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river estuaries, north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, the traveler can rest assured that they will have somewhere to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have contracts with specific hotels, although you can book accommodation elsewhere, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Tourist agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They might hold your reservation if you need a little time to consider the offer or to secure other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
All changes, additions, or requests should be checked first with the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close as possible to the center of events, you will have to arrive early and snag a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has finished, there are parts of the festival where music plays late into the night.
At some festivals, there are special camping zones for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin because passage through ice creates a terrible sound for those most vulnerable.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include passage through the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically invest a lot of effort to maximize the time and money guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and encourage them to stay.
Some venues allow patrons to bring their own alcohol. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as you would on asphalt.
During snowstorms, a significant amount of snow can fall in a very short time, enough to trap you.
Visibility may be limited by falling or accumulated snow, or by condensation or freezing on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, frost and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic flows almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The popular understanding of the term safari refers to a land journey to observe the magnificent African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closely, so even the standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
Walking safaris (also called "wilderness walks", "mountain safaris" or simply walking "on foot") consist of hiking, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having previously hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
There are differences in cancellation policies, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies triggered by coronavirus were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which could cause shrinking, or in extreme cases, burning).
Although there are different ways to purify water, some of them are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it’s enough to boil water for one minute, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters differ in efficiency, which you should be mindful of, and you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Passengers may encounter pests that are not found in the regions they come from.
Parasites can spoil food, cause inflammation, or in more serious cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force, are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at specific locations.
Travelers who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch from Point Marion to Fairmont has the most exciting driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, passing through secluded woodland areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: large potholes, a narrow road, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the preceding and following sections, typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), so strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
However, surprisingly, the mobile signal is much stronger here than in other areas, such as, for example, the Pennsylvania Divines.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Baked goods with fruit, especially apples in pastry, are commonly made throughout the year, and in summer you can find them with cherries and plums.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes go wonderfully with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, try these, which depending on the region are called Berliner, Fankuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish with herbs and spices, that contains meat or vegetables.
The cartilage can be “dry” or “watery,” depending on the amount of fluid.
In the continental regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used to prepare curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
The term "Indonesian food" is a general term encompassing a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation of 17,000 islands.
However, if used without additional attributes, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine showcases a selection of simply seasoned dishes, with the dominant flavors being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but there may also be safety concerns due to the possibility of their feet getting stuck in them.
If a horse throws its rider, but the rider's foot gets stuck in the stirrup, if the horse bolts, it's possible for it to drag the rider. To minimize the risk, a large number of precautionary measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear boots with heels and a smooth, very narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety handles that allow the stirrup leathers to fall from the saddle if pulled by the rider during a fall.
The Cochamó Valley – the main destination for rock climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with diverse, large granite walls and cracks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes through the endless potential of the mountain slopes.
Winter alpine sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you glide across snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a main activity when traveling for many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," whose entire vacation revolves around skiing at a specific location.
The depiction of skiing is very old – there are images on caves of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It is related, but doesn’t always involve alpine ski touring or mountaineering, which are performed on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Treat the ski slope like a similar path for walking.
In good conditions, you could cover greater distances than by walking – but you would rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean repeatedly submitting to visa applications and passport control.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like a single state in this respect.
As long as you are in this zone, you can generally cross borders without constantly going through passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition varies depending on geographical location, with the age limit potentially being lower in North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is the most important means of subsistence for the Laplanders, and the culture connected with trade is also important for many other professions.
But even traditionally, not all Laplanders were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived off fishing, hunting and the like, while reindeer were typically used as working animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is a significant income source in Sápmi, in the Sápmi region.
Although widely used, especially among those who are not Roma, the word "Gypsy" is generally considered offensive because it evokes negative stereotypes and a misperception of the Roma people.
If travel warnings are issued for the country you wish to visit, it may have implications for your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may want to get advice from other governments as well, but their advice is meaningful for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations are merely a brief overview of the political situation in a given country.
The presented viewpoints are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any adverse weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious societal disruption, and loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many types, which depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal phenomena of severe weather conditions include snowfall, blizzards, ice pellets, and strong winds with dust.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the risk of adverse weather conditions that may affect the area they are in, as this could impact their plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Searching the internet for 'Hostile Environment Awareness Training' will likely provide you with an address of a local company.
The course covers all the problems discussed here in detail, usually through practical experience.
The course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes, weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are often encountered, but publications on coping in wartime are very rare.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
Governments’ willingness to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated with a preferred name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to authenticate these documents is equally variable.
Security checks at checkpoints became much more intrusive in the period following September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals before surgery should not expect to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being violated.
The quick backwash from the breaking waves on the beach is most often caused by a reef or similar feature.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow accumulates in the deeper parts, and here a fast current of deep water can form.
Most fatalities occur as a result of exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere you won't get stuck again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue services.
Reverse culture shock appears earlier than cultural shock (has a shorter period of bliss), lasts longer, and can be more difficult.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes have particular difficulty readjusting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adjusted to the new culture and have forgotten some habits from your home culture.
When you travel abroad for the first time, people are likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to the new country.
Many people wouldn’t assume that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The show with sounds and lighting of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
The pyramids are visible even in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, the sound of tourists and vendors is constantly heard. The story of the sound and light is like something out of a fairytale.
The Sphinx is positioned as a backdrop and narrator of an endless story.
Images are displayed on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by multiple nations and have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Livingston and Deception Islands are also included, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano creates a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here converge into a plateau, and then rise again to form the Ellsworth Mountains crest for a length of 360 km, intersected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak of Mount Vinson at 4,892 m.
In remote locations, without a mobile phone network, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A standard satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone because to make a call, you must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used by ships, both cargo and yachts, as well as expeditions that require data and voice messages remotely.
Your local phone operator should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
Traveling with learning is becoming an increasingly popular option for those planning to take a break from education.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, giving them a chance to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can improve your chances of getting into university when you return to your home country.
Typically, there will be tuition fees for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. In the “Land of a Thousand Lakes” there are also thousands of islands in both the lakes and the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't need to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are truly large enough for any yacht, a completely different experience is had with smaller boats or even kayaks.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, and one in every seventh or eighth person owns a boat.
Something similar can be found in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, while it is otherwise very unique (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most cruises on the stunning Baltic Sea include a longer stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a few days while returning to the ship to sleep at night.
If you travel to the coast on excursion boats, you will not need a special visa (since 2009).
Some cruises in the brochures also include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, so visiting the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before, or if they've had a traumatic experience.
There’s no need to be ashamed of that: it’s no different from personal fears and disgust towards other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help them overcome fear based on the unknown or loss of control.
Courier services are well-paid for the fast delivery of packages. Time is often very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
For some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem for other routes and smaller firms.
If they ship packages by air freight, some routes require days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get them there faster was to send them as checked baggage. Aviation regulations won’t allow baggage to be shipped without a passenger. This is where you come in.
The obvious way to travel in first or business class is to pay a hefty sum for that privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: however much it’s calculated as a rule, expect to pay four times more for a business class price than for economy class, and eleven times more expensive for first class!
Generally speaking, there’s no point in asking for a discount on a seat in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a large amount of dollars for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
In 1994, conflict spurred the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the unsuccessful political negotiations, economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna, once upon a time, is now a modern, developed, and bustling trade center, spread across a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are adorned with traditional roofs of red tiles, an 18th-century bazaar, and old mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere resembles Mediterranean Europe more than traditional Turkey.
The village of Halldarsvik offers a view of the nearby island of Äjtrö and has an unusual octagonal church.
Above some of the graves in the churchyard there are interesting marble dove sculptures.
Every moment of the half-hour walk through the picturesque village is worth remembering.
Close by, to the north, is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known for its brilliant collection and lush beauty noted by Lord Byron.
Bus number 403 of "Scotturb" regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also, to the north, visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple), a place where the world-renowned apparitions of the Virgin Mary took place.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, as well as a place that has immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still surviving men and women who are alive today, and many others who had loved ones who were killed or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the place by marking or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, and a vast majority understand it, while almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are written only in Catalan because legally it is the first official language.
However, the Spanish language is widely used in public transport and other institutions.
Standard announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, while unplanned disruptions are reported by an automated system in a number of languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-absorbed, unfriendly, and arrogant.
While this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to have a good time in Paris is to be as cultured as possible, and to act as someone who is “bien élevé” (well-mannered). This will greatly ease your stay.
The rough exterior of Parisians quickly melts away if you show a little basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is abundant with forested areas, mainly beech, fir and spruce, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkably large number of variations in plant communities due to the diverse microclimates, varied soils, and changing altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, bison, lynx, wildcat, and peacock can be found there, as well as many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees, and their shoulders should also be covered.
Most monasteries offer headscarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in a light color, you’ll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
And this can be borrowed from what is available at the entrance, but that clothing isn't washed after every use, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing those skirts. For men, there's a universal size!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in everything.
A simple, popular supper, especially in summer, is “pa amb oli”: bread with olive oil, tomato, and all sorts of toppings, like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word Sie for You, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
That's a good way to distinguish verbs from nouns.
So reading is easier too, although writing somehow becomes complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a nominal form.
The pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because most words are pronounced as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are "c" and "g", because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, try to pronounce the sounds 'r' and 'rr' differently: caro means dear, and carro means carriage.
The Persian language is relatively easy and has a largely systematic grammar.
Therefore, reading the grammar primer will help you learn a lot about the grammar of the Persian language and better understand the expressions.
It should be noted that if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is close enough and doesn't need to be learned separately.
Observatories built before the modern era are usually obsolete today and continue to be used as museums or educational locations.
Because when they were most popular, light pollution wasn’t a problem for them as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses and are more easily accessible than those built nowadays.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where the plum blossom is the most desired flower.
In Japan, the first blossom-viewing parties were held by the emperor solely for himself and the members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in their natural environment. Therefore, resist the temptation to remove even “just one” specimen.
If you visit a formally maintained garden, you may be kicked out without discussion for collecting “specimens”.
Generally speaking, Singapore is an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
However, given that it is located in the “most tropical place” just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to cope with both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (less often when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, the place where, according to tradition, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Check if the bus you're thinking of taking goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for basing a vacation on them.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley, or perhaps cruising to interesting cities along the Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also determine routes for well-known hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, celebrated as the day of the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night awake at some open spot, in order to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological interpretations of this tradition, but it’s also possible it’s a pre-Christian ritual for spring and fertility.
Traditionally, churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with a gathering that transitions into a celebration at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to travel, making the Galapagos Islands a primary grazing ground for the giant tortoise.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
You can experience the polar night if you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, which essentially means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis as the sky will be dark for almost the entire day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not usually a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are typically accustomed to.
Suits are considered standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Workplace harmony is most important, emphasizing teamwork rather than giving compliments to individuals.
Workers often have to obtain approval from their supervisors for any decision they make and are expected to follow their supervisors' instructions without question.
