This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already popular, but reveals details that fossils usually cannot show, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color underneath.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other functions for springs – barbules and calami – the researchers hypothesized that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, as were the other relevant features.
The feather structure suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers proposed that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not downy fluff.
The researchers suggested that, even though this was the tail of a dinosaur, the sample showed the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey. Two police officers were killed and more than 20 other people were injured.

The Iraqi study group presented their report at 12:00 GMT today.
It gives a warning that no one can guarantee that any action taken in Iraq at this point will stop sectarian warfare, increasing violence, or chaos.
The report begins with an open debate regarding the criminal case and the formation of consensus in the USA concerning policy towards the Middle East.
The report is very skeptical of most aspects of the current policy of the executive branch towards Iraq, and encourages an immediate change of direction.
First among its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to secure Iraq’s borders against hostile interventions and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon affects the gravity on Earth, and thus causes tides, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy with its forces.
The researchers concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in exactly the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory posits that the vast majority of dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll encountered a strain of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) that was particularly drug-resistant in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some of the patients may have been infected with the bacteria in the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers.
Within a year, an infected person can easily infect 10 to 15 of their close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire population with tuberculosis appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected in South Africa.

“Their thermal behavior isn’t as stable as large caves on Earth, which are often maintained by a fairly constant temperature, but is instead consistent with being deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters enter a booth alone and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their candidate's choice in an envelope.
After election officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the ballot into the ballot box and signs the roll of voters.
French election law has quite strict codification of legal proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those carefully counted and from approved eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all parts of the process. Throughout the evening, votes are counted by volunteers according to specific procedures and under strict supervision.

In her second run, she finished tenth in the women's sitting class with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austria's Claudia Loesch in first place and 1:09.02 minutes behind Gøngyi Dani of Hungary in ninth place.
In the women's seated group, there were four skiers who failed to finish the race, and 45 of the total 117 competitors in the giant slalom did not advance.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused have been named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with their faces covered, said police chief inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
Emergency services helped the driver out of the red Audi TT, while the street where the accident occurred was temporarily closed.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh's court charged with killing his son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any potential eyewitnesses may have been influenced since her image has been widely publicized.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently, so courts consider the publication of images as potentially damaging to the victim.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes “journalists seem to be walking a tightrope if they publish pictures etc. of suspects.”
Journalists have been informed by the Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, that no further comment will be made until charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document is said to refer to the border disputes, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
The future situation of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations and the Jordan Valley, was among the topics discussed.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian state agrees to allow this force to remain for only five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control were closely monitored by forest rangers, which led to the trial being monitored and its efficiency evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new electoral council (CEP) of 9 members yesterday.
It is actually Martelly’s fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission last month recommended reinstating the former CEP officials (Haiti’s electoral council) as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was a response from Martelly to widespread demonstrations against the regime, which began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations arose due to the lack of held elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheating iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and resulting in minor burns for four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said they had been aware of 27 accidents linked to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple’s postponement of the report “very regrettable.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (7:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Office said no injuries were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication that a tsunami would occur.
A Filipino man, a former police officer, has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Eventually, photographers took the seat of an old woman when she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained to become an obstetrician and in 1959 he began working at Auckland’s National Women’s Hospital.
Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would increase the speed of the baby's lung development.
Xinhua reported that state investigators retrieved two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels said that “Luna was as strange as me…maybe even more…love her and will miss her…hopefully she’s in a better place.”
Of the 1400 people who voted before the federal election in 2010, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent in the poll share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the opinion poll, 29% believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim both the 100m and 200m freestyle, and three legs at the Commonwealth Games, but due to the complaints, doubts have begun to arise about his form.
He hasn't been able to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, because they are banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the cause of water on Earth, in addition to organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, especially with regard to Earth.
Cuomo (53) began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and foolishness."
There is speculation about whether he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will enable aircraft to fly shorter routes and annually save a lot of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, in contrast to older ground-based technology, which allows air traffic control to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport will be provided, trains above ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and short-term facilities are unavailable on site.
The possibility of being forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters was raised due to fears of a lack of transportation.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species had evolved in just two generations, although many had believed this process would take much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin’s finch, the Medium Ground-Finch, and the immigrant Cactus-Finch, the Large Cactus-Finch.
Gold can come in all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into incredibly small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can also be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and adhere to other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a chemical pH. You can create an indicator using cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) found in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms are one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this feels strange and creates a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient times, toilets also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together.
Whenever you call someone thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
A gigantic rocket exceeding 100 British feet in length is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in wonderful ways. The best thing the wheel has given us is a means of transportation that is much easier and faster.
It has given us many modes of transport, such as the train, the car, and more.
Below them, there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from hares to antelopes and roe deer.
Finally, there are several small kittens (including feral cats) that eat the far more numerous prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind the success is the niche concept: a special job for each cat, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat species and they live together in larger groups called coalitions.
The alliances consist of 1–3 related adult males, together with up to thirty females and pups.
The females are usually closely related to each other, as they make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion pride behaves much like a wolf or dog pack, animals that surprisingly have a lot in common with lion behavior (but not with other big cats). They are also deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These 4 felines are the only ones that roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the fully developed roar of a lion, but more like a sentence with grating words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Researchers believe that wolverines track and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, sniffing the ground to find where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move completely unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings before attacking.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from—for example, if they move across a mountainous area or a river, or if they migrate to a new island making it difficult to return—they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
The new population will need different features or adaptations than they needed before to be a strong competitor, as this new environment has different resources and different competitors.
The original population hasn't changed; they still need the same adaptation as before.
As the new people gradually begin to adapt to their new surroundings, they look less and less like the other population.
After a couple of thousand years, or after millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We have named this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (so just breathe out deeply).
Plants make their own food from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals would not survive without plants.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, fearless except when facing other mosasaurs.
The long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper jaw—no one who crossed its path lived to tell the tale.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may also have been a cannibal.
In addition, it also attacked anything that came into the water, even a gigantic dinosaur like, for example, T. rex would not be a match for it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
The fact that poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, whereas the rich men preferred to have banquets together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals, was another difference.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from the USA or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn or tomatoes, nor potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, and these were considered the god's home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests attempted to fulfill the gods’ needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary made for the god.
Houses were not as essential in the high-temperature climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family mostly lived outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the garden; shops were merely open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land areas around Canaan, which made timber extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, they discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time, independently of his discovery.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, even though all the countries were considered “Scandinavian.”
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you can probably imagine there’s a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite something being written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written: “Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776.” The text can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So the note was likely added as a label.
The invasion and the subsequent fighting on D-Day liberated Northern France, but Southern France was still not liberated.
It was controlled by French “Vichy” individuals. These were French people who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and actually worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
The invasion on August 15, 1940, when the Allies invaded southern France, was called "Operation Dragoon."
Within just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a rather large population living and working together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, meaning civil, related to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, and this thus defines, in a way, the size of the society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilization's culture presupposes passing on knowledge through multiple generations, a linguistic footprint, and just dissemination that endures.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are not considered proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national leader or judicial system, it was dependent on state governments, which were generally unwilling to cooperate in enforcing its actions.
It also had no authority to override the tax law and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all the states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian and German national teams are the second-best teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsport are popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest is called Honshu), and this makes Japan the world's 7th largest island!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical context, as an "archipelago."
Taiwan’s beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by gave the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began shifting to indigenous grain production practices, employing Chinese workers to work on their rice paddies and sugar plantations.
Forces from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan’s coastal areas in the west and north in 1683, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
Following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding rights to Taiwan to Japan, which continued to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has 3 important structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally constructed.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, 35mm is still the most common format for still photography in the world, as it was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly, the digital camera's image sensor formats have inherited the aspect ratio of the film camera.
It can be a little confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS family formats) are similar, or approximately similar to this aspect’s aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds is often misused and ridiculed, but it’s a simple guideline that creates dynamism while still providing a goal for order in a picture.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized during this period in European history.
For thousands of years, Christianity had united European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervading authority affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the essential principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate pain and poverty, and that is why the church has funds available.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy demonstrated that the effect of cutting vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated widely accepted international law codified through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain bombed international waters to prevent ships from entering large areas of the sea, creating danger even for neutral ships.
Germany was prepared for a corresponding response to its unrestricted submarine warfare, as there had been limited reaction to this tactic.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed all the fear and horrors of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to work for Edison's company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a poetry book, and a letter of reference from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showcasing different historical periods; each phase of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best-known of these periods were the Three Kingdoms, which took place over 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many kings who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying while fighting for a seat of power in the grand palace at Xiadel.
There are several social and political effects associated with the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and a belief that the nation is governed by its citizens rather than just one ruler.
Even after the revolution, it was open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to prosper.
The same applied to the defense, because instead of military ranks based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was a motivation for other oppressed people in the working class in other nations to also launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that go beyond mortal life. He often used a cave known as “Hira” on Mount “Noor” (light), where he went to contemplate.
The cave itself, which has been preserved over the years, offers a very vivid depiction of Muhammad’s spiritual inclination.
On a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave lies completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It's actually not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. As soon as you're inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing else to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The only one of the seven wonders that still stands today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the “Giza necropolis” in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, encompasses many pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), many small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
The "upstroke" symbol resembles a V, and the "downstroke" symbol resembles a pin or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and push the bow.
An upstroke usually brings out a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more defined.
You are welcome to use a pencil and create your own markings, but don't forget that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be taken into account.
The terrified royal family – King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, together with their two young children (Marie Therese, age 11, and Louis-Charles, age 4) – and the king’s sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
The King and Queen returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and yelling threats at them.
The group of people forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows completely open.
At one point, a member of the gang swung the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles before the frightened queen.
The Filipino people themselves had to pay the cost of the American imperialistic war, in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the costs, and interest on bonds was processed in the name of the Philippine authorities through Wall Street banking houses.
The superprofits extracted from the exploitation of the Filipino people were a fundamental gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the circumstances that led to the order’s creation.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The Mughal Empire did not interfere with the socio-cultural traditions of its subjects for most of its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive governing elites, leading to more systematic, centralized, and uniform regulations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general beliefs: that the development of technology itself follows a trajectory beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology additionally has “effects” on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
One could, for example, say that road development is happening because of the car.
A nationwide road network, however, is not economically viable if used by only a handful of cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass car ownership creates and more instances of accidents on roads, which has led to the invention of new methods in the healthcare sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a greater element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
What characterized Romanticism was the idea that the landscape shaped individuals and that, over time, geographical habits and cultures arose, and that these, when in harmony with one's position in society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of fashion in our time, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It has been known as a center of luxury from around 400 AD to approximately 1100 AD.
The situation was not the same in the 12th century, mainly due to the Crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this period that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th–11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, outfits were strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest changes that occurred at that time, and as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture for producing enough food to just meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficiency farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds native to the area combined with crop rotation or other techniques to maximize yields that are relatively easy to achieve.
Historically, most farmers focused on subsistence agriculture, which is still relevant in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded from social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus on the unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, were not adequately socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Children like that are called "wild children." Some feral children have been held captive by people (usually their own parents), and in some cases this was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
It is possible that children who are feral may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or managed to escape.
Others are allegedly said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When a feral child is completely raised by animals, it develops behaviors (within physical limitations) that are almost identical to those of the fostering animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Even though project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it to a new level.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a support tool that assists individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as when learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical. A teacher can therefore also be a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support features have been integrated into the software and are designed to question, encourage, and explain procedures that the student may have found challenging to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No children should have to grow up in an atmosphere that isn't caring and educational, but it happens.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should ensure safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should be able to provide all the necessities that they didn't have in the home they came from.
It is a combination of elements with both mass and interpersonal communication on the internet.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to extra dimensions in relation to the use and satisfaction approach.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are considered important motivational factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified “personal involvement” and “enduring relationships” as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience reactions to websites (1998).
Through the use of video recordings, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, fleeting movements of the face that last only a few milliseconds.
It has particularly been claimed that one can find out if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks suggests in his essay, The President's Tale, that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He also claims that such abilities to explain human behavior can be shared by animals, such as pet dogs.
According to modern research, there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination switch back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to obtain sufficient amino acids from the available plant resources on the savanna.
Furthermore, not doing so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The proteins found in leaves and legumes would be the most readily available plant resources, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking them first.
Animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are, in contrast, not only easily digestible, but also provide proteins in high quantities containing all the essential amino acids.
We shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" using a method quite similar to the one chimpanzees on the savanna employ today.
Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep hours while falling back asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a fairly quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find that you turn off the alarm while asleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, which leads to needing to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can become enlightened. The only thing standing in the way of such insight is our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded to include the Mahayana emphasis on loving-kindness and several methods from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and complete love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) can be awakened through kundalini yoga via yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Tibetan meditation centers around deity yoga. Energy channels are cleansed by visualizing various deities. This will activate the chakras and consciousness becomes enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which caused cooperation between the USSR and the USA. Clashes between systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries falling out towards the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would truly be fought, by proxy armies on battlefields in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places in Africa to Asia.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the last option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian border.
These plans were nevertheless rendered obsolete almost overnight, as over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish peace treaty, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move theirs.
The campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II is one of the most important recent examples of this. The Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic to provide aid to Great Britain.
The German navy simultaneously attempted to stop this traffic, mostly using submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
It started with ancient cultures and tribes keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hillsides or other grazing areas, typically tended by goat herders who were often children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Tramways in England were made as early as the 16th century.
Even though the roadways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull themselves along to achieve greater speeds and haul heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
To keep the rails in place, the cross-tie was introduced quite early on. However, it was gradually realized that the rails were more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first solid iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transportation. Humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, and two-way specialization has been discovered in fossils of Australopithecus dating from 4.2–3.9 million years ago.
We can start by adopting a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to, to some extent, lessen future suffering.
This is often just like symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and remove them.
The world has changed greatly from human scientific and technological advancements, and difficulties have become more complicated due to overpopulation and humanity’s extravagant lifestyle.
A handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, then sent a few quarters of a mile to the printing shop of John Dunlap following its adoption by Congress on July 4th.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight and these are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One copy arrived to George Washington on July 6th, which he had read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The first copy, which was handwritten, has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived, and lives on to this day – they are called birds.
Some people don't consider them true dinosaurs since they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulating information encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1. These digits are referred to as binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally not sufficient for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be finding open medicine containers or poisonous household items at the scene.
For first aid guidance specific to the poison in question, see the label.
Entomologists use the word insect in a formal sense for this group of invertebrates.
This designation originates from an old association with midges, insects highly adapted to attack humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
Based on what we know, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the USA, making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple may come to the conclusion that it is not in their best interest, or the child's, to raise a child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. Most scientific research is actually guided by this method.
Experimentation, however, is not solely about that, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more potential hypotheses by asking questions. Observations also contribute to guiding scientific research in the right direction.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle’s views on everything related to science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became more distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are generally entirely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been demonstrated in virtually all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and not only as reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of independent cycles without external influence.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals suggesting that DNA could be a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or in other words viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted 2 attempts to label either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of place-based activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and investigating details about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive by car to get to work outside the village, while others drive in the opposite direction because their workplace is in the village others are leaving.
In this dynamic vehicle for transport, everyone is in some way connected to, and a supporter of, a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that the large carbon economy has destabilized the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Most people are dissatisfied with transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or about bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate so much dissatisfaction, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of individual drivers and vehicle movements between two points, and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is complicated, as it is impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with a reasonable degree of consistency, allowing traffic flow to remain fairly consistent and capable of being calculated mathematically with a reasonable degree of certainty.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in connection with the planning, design, and operation of road systems.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. Their ability to fly made it easier and more efficient for them to escape enemies, find food, and mates.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
Because of this, they have several small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and hoverflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus believed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the Earth's largest and second-longest river. More than 8 times as much water flows here as in the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, it is ten kilometers wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers on land and into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main river Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Even though pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, they never surpassed the size and technical execution of the pyramids at Giza.
People from ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language used by Vatican City in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language used daily by state employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every resident of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of these are found in their natural form in nature and because they are relatively easy to extract, even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had theories that everything comprises a mix of one or more of the earth’s four elements. The four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also believed they transform into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are fundamentally a mix of 2 or more metals. Remember that there is a diversity of elements on the periodic table.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that several trillion of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good help to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, now that newer writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been considered to have lower status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, and should never get close to a sniper.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with more protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Fractures the core again and releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to fall apart more or less spontaneously.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is around 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the back side.
Thinner under the maria, and thicker under the highlands.
It’s possible there's more magma on the side facing us, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they mature and approach adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about certain individuals that makes them want what they want, and which aspects of their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
As a rule, two behavioral patterns emerge when leaders start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain “one of the guys/girls.”
For this type of leader, it can be difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary measures, performance reviews, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels they must change absolutely everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for whether the team wins or loses.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They generally have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to many different time zones, something the local leadership may not always understand.
An “invisible team” that is present (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The “invisible group” is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible group sets the standard for each individual member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal is to put organizational learning concepts into practice – innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively by all functional departments within an organization, creativity and innovation can arise.
The process where an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can thus lead to new innovative processes that can help meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as share knowledge and organizational learnings.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a way to provide assistance to organizations to improve performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical documentation for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. It narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The interaction between brain pathology and behavior is a validation for researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Brain structures and processes we have never seen before are now possible to investigate thanks to the emergence of new technologies.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes taking place in our brain.
Even though artificial intelligence (AI) evokes a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is about creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling and planning the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting analysis, voice and facial recognition.
These have developed into separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, and is built into many home PCs and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of all classrooms. Teachers generally love to take students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the opportunity for a solution with virtual field trips. Students can observe museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
A great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes could also be to share the excursion virtually.
For example, students from Bennet school in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital every year; the website is restructured each year, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help to improve student writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience will generally change that.
The blogger started to improve their writing to avoid criticism, as students are often the most critical audience.
Also, blogging “forces students to become more updated on the world around them.” The need to give the public what they want inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that motivates collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning abilities beyond the typical school day they are used to.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively reacting to online materials, students can define their positions in relation to others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada with numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada’s history and present day.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, in Muskoka and beyond, one finds pristine nature in all its beauty.
All of this and more shows Ontario what outsiders consider to be truly Canadian.
Large areas in the north are very sparsely populated, and in some places are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of the population figures that surprises many: There are more African Americans residing in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of them, and is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury holiday resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the nations, and it became popular in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the northern region, it is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It is recommended that female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can mean what they would consider harassment is not, and that being followed, grabbed by the arm, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm about saying no to men, and don’t be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it still doesn’t make it acceptable!).
The city we know as Casablanca today was founded in the tenth century BC, and was used as a strategic port under the name Anfa by Berber fishermen, Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids.
The Portuguese tore it down and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan built the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was called Casablanca due to Spanish merchants who had established their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hoodies, and a whole spectrum of jewelry, are easy to find around the old medina, but they are mainly sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, and the eruption caused most of the city's streets, especially the city center, to be buried.
Even though Goma is quite safe, all visits outside of Goma should be researched beforehand to understand the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the most affordable mountain hikes to see gorillas in Africa.
To get around in Goma, you can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). A typical (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands, combined with relative inaccessibility.
Even though Timbuktu has its own airport and its reputation has made the city a tourist attraction, it is a very poor city.
Due to the threat from desert sand, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger in 1990.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, because it has a more Arabic than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and can be divided into 14 different ecozones, which support diverse wildlife.
This is one of the most popular attractions in South Africa and is considered the finest national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card (a ticket), which grants access to either a selection of parks, or all of the national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and is the place many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, clearly visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
If you want the finest view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The majority of Hong Kong Island’s urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonists took over, and it’s a good place to start if you’re looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past.
The largest mangrove forest on the planet is Sundarbans, extending 80 kilometers (50 mi) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps – here are some of the last remaining areas of jungle, which once covered the vast plains.
Sundarbans consists of an area of 3,850 km² with approximately one-third of the area covered by water and marshland.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, despite the fact that most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the local buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Small Japanese coastal buses that are both comfortable and durable serve most districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapok River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapok River and connects Oyapock and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters, it is 378 meters high and it has two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it remained closed to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational from September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay was the Guarani people, who were semi-nomadic hunters, but agriculture was also their livelihood.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," became a country as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous people.
The colonization period, which lasted for 3 centuries, was started by the Spanish.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its local character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams with some of the best players in the world.
This year's biggest tournament will be held in December, at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
See the Argentine Polo Association for news about tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches.
The Falkland pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands, with its value set equal to that of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley above the FIC West shop.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what is an accepted payment method.
It is difficult to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern part of the planet, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months.
The cold can be deceiving in winter as the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but a combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There isn't really a distinct "rainy season" and "dry season" – the amount of rainfall is consistent throughout the year.
Most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but nevertheless, the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
Bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack no matter how peaceful they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't kept a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly meals and keep a clean camp.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
When seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor in 1889, it became the infamous site of the maritime protest.
Except for one British cruiser, all the ships were sunk and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town meeting led to the murder of leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland having 2 harbours, there are more beaches. The most popular ones are located in 3 places.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbour district lie in the Pacific Ocean. The beaches there stretch all the way from Long Bay in the north – to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are safe for swimming, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes you find crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. It is safe to swim.
The most important local beer is "Number One," which isn't a complex but pleasant and refreshing beer. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that should be tasted, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you’re concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
For people from Australia, the idea of a “flat white” coffee is foreign. A short black is “espresso”, cappuccino comes with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The cocoa lives up to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive, but fantastic.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef, and injuries rarely occur as a result of any of these things.
Nevertheless, accept advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and near rivers from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be observed outside of this period.
There are sharks, but it is unusual for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean. Their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind, knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book accommodation in other areas, such as at a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies most often sell package deals including breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combinations with flights and hotels.
They can also reserve a seat for you if you need time to consider an offer or obtain other documents for your agreement (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of security staff choose to camp on site, and most of them consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where the action is, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night even after the music on the main stage is finished.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the cabin's location, as driving through ice generates extremely loud noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms and conditions).
Casinos typically make many attempts to maximize the amount of time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment options for guests, to keep them in good spirits and to encourage them to stay at the place.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. But alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who plans to drive in the highlands or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
The friction is low, and therefore you cannot drive on ice- and snow-covered roads as you would on dry asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall that you could stumble within a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the largest form of tourism that attracts tourists to Africa and is the main point for many visitors.
The term "safari" in common usage refers to trips to countries to see the magnificent African wildlife, specifically on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to approach cars and standard equipment, which will allow for good vantage points.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be quite shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk" or "balance walk") involves going on a hike, for either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24, 2021 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The city held the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may struggle.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, cancellation policies will not be extended to July 2020, as the Olympics were planned then.
It is expected that most activity tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets priced around ¥7000.
It can help to iron damp clothes to get them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if it’s not in the room.
If an iron is unavailable or you want to avoid wearing creased socks, you can try using a hair dryer instead, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorch marks).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient, while in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you're unsure, you can always buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter infectious animal diseases that they are unfamiliar with from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, at worst, lead to allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing humans with their power, are generally not qualified as plague.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from tax and can only be purchased in specific locations.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh highway are the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often runs through remote woodland terrain.
If you are unfamiliar with driving on country roads, keep a cool head: there are many steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp curves.
Speed limits posted are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – typically 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h) – and it’s even more important to respect them than usual.
Interestingly enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than along many other places along the route, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very flavorful. In Bavaria, they are rich and varied, and can be compared to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is common, with apples baked inside available year-round, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts that grow on trees. Many of the popular cakes taste especially good with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called, depending on the region, a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry dish is based on herbs and spices, mixed with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid in it, a curry can either be dry or moist.
In inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is regularly used in curry dishes, while coconut milk is commonly used in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term covering a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the nation.
If used without further clarification, however, the term usually refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now much is available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by lightly spiced dishes, with a dominant flavor of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hang down on each side of the saddle and are supports for the rider.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can be less safe due to the possibility of a rider getting stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along by the horse if it runs off. To minimize this danger, many precautions can be taken.
Most riders first use riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrup bars that cause the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The largest climbing destination in Chile, Cochamó Valley, is known as South America’s Yosemite, with many large walls and granite boulders.
The top climbs offer stunning views from the mountain peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in the endless seas of mountain walls.
Snow sports in downhill slopes, encompassing both skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve riding down snow-covered areas with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing holidays are a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depict skiers dating back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century. In 1861, the first leisure-based ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity also goes by other names such as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but generally doesn't include downhill skiing or alpine climbing; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than if you walk – but it is very rare you will achieve high speeds without a heavy backpack on trails.
Europe is a rather small continent, but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, a journey through several nations would mean more visa applications and passport controls.
However, the Schengen Area functions almost as one country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points again.
At the same time, you do not need to apply for a visa to each individual Schengen member country if you have a Schengen visa, and therefore you save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal explanation for what manufactured articles qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities consider items older than 100 years to be antiques.
The definition varies geographically, including the fact that the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques even if they are newer than comparable mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami people and also important for the trading culture for many with other professions.
Although traditionally not all Sami people have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting and the like, while reindeer were mostly used as draft animals.
In our time, many of the Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you are planning to travel to, it may affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
It may be that you also want to consult with authorities other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
An example could be that American citizens in the Middle East encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The guidelines are merely brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The showings presented are often superficial, general, and simple compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all very serious weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, severe social consequences, or loss of life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types. Weather types can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and forest fires are forms of and effects of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, torrential rain, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena consist of blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of inclement weather affecting their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Those planning to visit countries considered war zones should receive professional training.
A search on the internet for “hostile environment courses” will likely return the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will typically last two to five days and involves role-playing, some first aid, and occasionally weapons training.
It’s common to find books and magazines about wilderness survival, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The government’s willingness to issue passports where gender is not marked (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
Foreign governments’ willingness to honor these documents is just as variable.
Since September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive.
Preoperative transgender individuals should not expect to get through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the recurring flow of waves breaking on the beach, a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current forms allowing deep water to develop there.
Most fatalities occur due to exhaustion while attempting to swim back against the current, which can be very problematic.
Once you get out of the current itself, swimming back isn't any more problematic than usual.
Try to aim for a spot where you won't be pulled back in, or, depending on your skill and whether you've been noticed, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
Return shock happens sooner than culture shock (the tension phase isn't there to the same extent as when moving away), it lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the old habits from your home culture.
The first time you traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, as they know that a traveler needs to adjust to a completely new country.
People perhaps don't expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the most exciting attractions in the area for children is the pyramid’s sound and light show.
The pyramids are visible at night, and you have the opportunity to see them in peace and quiet before the performance begins.
Usually, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors here. The tale of the sound and light is just like a fairytale.
The Sphinx is used both as a backdrop and as a narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several countries and host the most bases, with 16 active ones in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest of them is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception Island where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
The area south of the peninsula is Ellsworth Land, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reappear and form the 360 km long mountain range that is the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
Mount Vinson's peak has a height of 4892 meters and is located on the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, in the northern part of the Sentinel Range.
In remote locations with poor or no mobile coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, recreational boats, and also on expeditions that have remote data and communication needs.
You can get more information about connecting to this service from your local telephone service provider.
Receiving education while traveling is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is particularly popular among graduating high school students (russ), allowing them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your home country.
Typically, there will be a school fee that needs to be registered for this type of educational program.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boating enthusiasts. “The Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
A yacht is not necessary in the archipelagos and lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7th or 8th person.
Even though this is the same for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (as in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
The vast majority of the distinctive Baltic cruises had an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can spend a couple of full days in the historical city, and return to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore using ship excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some of the cruises have included Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea, and the trip there is therefore not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of; it's no different than other things that many people fear or dislike.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help some people overcome a fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Freight companies earn a lot of money for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies use their own planes, but for smaller companies it was problematic.
If they had sent things by air freight, it could have taken days on some routes to get through loading and customs.
The only way to get it through quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don’t allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to shell out a hefty sum for the privilege (or even better, have your company pay for it).
However, this won't be cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can prepare to pay up to four times more than the regular economy price for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts on business class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there is a certain group of travelers who are willing to pay well to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. Romanian is the local language, but Russian is also widely used.
The multiethnic republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the 3rd largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. Izmir is the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good transportation hub.
Smyrna was formerly just an ancient city, but is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial center located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are drawn with traditional red pitched roofs, the 18th-century square alongside old mosques and churches, even though the city has an atmosphere more similar to the European Mediterranean region than traditional Turkey.
You can see the island of Eysturoy from the village of Haldarsvík, which also has an unusual octagonal church.
There are fabulous marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves in the cemetery.
It's worth spending half an hour strolling through the exciting village.
To the north, and not too far away, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra. It became known among foreigners after Lord Byron gave it a glowing review.
Scotturb bus number 403 travels regularly to Sintra and has a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you should also visit the large crypt Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place with Marian art that is popular worldwide.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave, in addition to a place that has almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time there, and many more who loved those who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat this place with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Please do not damage the area by marking or scratching graffiti into structures.
Barcelona's official languages are both Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer Catalan, and most understand the language, but virtually everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan because it is legally established as the first official language.
Spanish is also used in public transport and other facilities regardless.
Regular announcements at the Metro station are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system with a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The reputation of Parisians is that they are self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get ahead in Paris is still to behave as well as possible, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make getting around considerably easier.
The Parisians' quick facade disappears quickly if you show a little basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by a lot of forest, mainly beech, spruce and fir trees, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying levels of altitude.
The area is also home to a very large number of animal and bird species.
There one rarely finds fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owls, lynx, wildcat, and black grouse, along with several common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer shawls to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, and especially if it’s brightly colored, you’ll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men are required to wear trousers that go below the knees.
This may also be borrowed from the stockroom upon entry, but the clothes may not be washed after each use, so they may be less comfortable to wear – these skirts are one size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and utilizes olive oil for everything.
A light and well-liked meal, at least in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread sliced and drizzled with olive oil, tomato, and optional toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns that appear together with the word "Sie" for you always start with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.
This is a significant method for being able to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, even though the writing is a bit difficult, as one then has to figure out whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The capital letters you need to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation differs based on the following vowel.
In addition, you should pay attention to the fact that the pronunciation of 'r' and 'rr' is different: *caro* means dear, while *carro* means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and quite straightforward grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand the sentences better.
If you already know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish quickly realize that Portuguese is close enough that you don't need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally somewhat outdated in our time and are often used as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution wasn't the type of problem in their heyday that it is today, they are usually found in cities or near educational institutions that are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossoms on display have been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century and are also known as hanami.
The concept originated in China, where flowering plum blossoms were the most popular flower.
The first cherry blossom festivals were arranged by the emperor in Japan solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even “just one” specimen.
If someone visits a formally landscaped garden and picks a few “samples,” you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, it’s a very easy place to get around, and you can find most things there once you arrive.
However, if you are placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to consider both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which doesn't happen as often).
There are also a couple of buses that go north to the city of Hebron, to the traditional burial site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their wives, are buried.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, which is nearby.
The inland waterways can be a nice theme to base a trip on.
Visit, for example, the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions we have during the holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to stay awake throughout Easter night at an exposed spot to watch the sunrise.
It may well have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual, but of course there are also Christian theological interpretations of this tradition.
Many traditional churches often hold Easter services on a Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The mammals couldn't make the journey due to the long distance to the continent, and thus the giant tortoise became the first grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Many mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos Islands since humans arrived, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, a time when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to witness the Northern Lights, as the sky remains dark more or less around the clock.
Since the places are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you will also have the opportunity to see the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Dress is the standard work attire, and employees address each other by last name or job title.
Collaboration is important in the workplace, with an emphasis on team effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees often need to obtain approval from their superiors for any decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors’ instructions without questioning them.
