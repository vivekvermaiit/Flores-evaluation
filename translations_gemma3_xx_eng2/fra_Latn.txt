The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and agrees with the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served. This can be achieved by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization, rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the magnitude so courageously described by Larry Nassar’s survivors was able to go unnoticed for so long and will adopt any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid in color underneath.
This discovery also allows for a better understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed shaft, known as a rachis, but nonetheless exhibit other characteristics specific to feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers have deduced that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the down of a hatchling.
Scientists clarify that it is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that the new mutation was "very disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients appear to have contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital staff.
Over a one-year period, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of drug-resistant TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 have been infected at some point in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the poll workers have verified their identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs their voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no ballots are present at the start of voting and that no ballots are added, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Her other race, the giant slalom, allowed her to finish tenth in the women’s seated group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth-place finisher, Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
In the women’s seated skiing category, four skiers were unable to finish their run; regarding the giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in the race failed to qualify.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: “We have arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we have recovered her phone and laptop.”
The defendants are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces concealed.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extricate the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is currently being held in custody awaiting formal charges and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised as her photo has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor’s office, which is responsible for all prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until arraignment.
According to the leak, the document will concern the dispute at the border that Palestine claims based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East war.
Among the other topics discussed were the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority will only consent to a period of five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association’s game hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first cull campaign were properly trained and briefed on safety procedures.
Martelly inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday, composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous electoral council as part of a series of measures aimed at putting the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which were supposed to have taken place in 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheating defective iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry reacted by describing Apple's postponement of the report as "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office reported that no damage had been reported in the country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shoots at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six of them have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, just like the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at Auckland’s National Women’s Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
Her research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the baby's lung maturation.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or “black boxes”) on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: “Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as strange as me… even stranger, perhaps… I love her and I will miss her… I hope she rests in peace.”
A poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal elections revealed that the number of opponents to transforming Australia into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view, and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness has been questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as it was prohibited during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "idle chatter and political nonsense."
It is thought that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technology, and not on the ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There is no additional transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable on the ground.
The fear of transport issues led to the possibility that the match might be played behind closed doors, without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the genesis of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was previously estimated to take much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant large beak finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and adhered to another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is what is called the pH of a chemical product. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with flushing systems in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
You need a giant rocket more than 30 meters tall to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest benefit it has brought us is making transportation much simpler and faster.
This brought us trains, cars, and many other modes of transport.
Below are felines of a medium size that eat prey of a similar size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
Furthermore, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat small prey, far more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called prides.
Packs are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as around thirty females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to one another, their families often consisting of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs—animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior—and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump great distances, and drag with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger belongs to the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger’s roar doesn’t resemble the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather a sentence whose words would be cries and growls.
Ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
According to scientists, ocelots track and locate animals to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing their trail on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots stalk their prey by blending into their environment before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment than the one it was previously in.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 teeth as sharp as razor blades, as well as an additional row of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed its path could not escape.
We aren't sure, but it's possible he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's even possible he was cannibalistic.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was no match for him.
Although the Romans ate food that is familiar to us, they consumed some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and the dormouse, a type of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and women ate their food sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to host banquets together where they reclined on their sides while eating.
Roman meals in antiquity could not have included these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god’s dwelling.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary to which only priests had access.
Some pyramidal towers, ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
The majority of life for the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and discovered Greenland—and named it as such—while traveling further west.
But independently of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country is considered “Scandinavian,” there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the film National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, one could read the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one truly knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage in its existence, the Great Scroll (which measures approximately 29 and three-quarter inches by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
She was governed by the Vichy French, Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying forces instead of confronting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term “civilization” is derived from the Latin word “civilis,” which means civil and is related to the Latin words “civis,” meaning citizen, and “civitas,” which means large city or city-state and also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it refers.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities – often uncooperative – to enforce its acts.
He also did not have the power to deviate from tax laws or customs duties between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to being composed of a group of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
The earliest records concerning Taiwan date back to the 15th century, with European sailors passing by mentioning it under the name Ilha Formosa, or “beautiful island.”
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to offer tourists a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm; it was the most widespread film format at the end of the analog film era.
It's still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, in fact, and it’s quite disconcerting, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) either match or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often mistreated and ridiculed, is simply a guideline that encourages dynamism while protecting the composition.
He indicates that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was challenged.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion linked European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the peasant.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s monetary funds are specifically there for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1000 years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this doctrine was being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law and codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime zones, thereby posing a threat even to neutral vessels.
Since this tactic only elicited a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a leaning towards pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different eras; each stage of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between numerous members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, as army rankings are no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the confines of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous under the name of “Hira’” on Mount “Noor” (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it’s not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
Above, one can only contemplate the clear and magnificent sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or “Giza necropolis”, in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, comprises several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor his wives as well as members of his family.
The “push” symbol looks like a V, and the “pull” symbol looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
The upper part means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and the lower part means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward bow stroke generally produces a softer sound, while a downward bow stroke is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own pencil markings, but remember that bow markings are printed for a musical reason and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king’s sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, due to the crowd, to have the windows of their carriages opened.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
Naturally, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place during the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – a period in European history spanning the 11th to 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself unfolds according to a process largely exceeding cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically, rather than socially, conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn drives the invention of new techniques in healthcare to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture linked to that geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered to be that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until approximately 1100.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its height between the 10th–11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication methods, Western fashions could be 25 to 30 years behind.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of the period, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often organic, using saved seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals feeling neglected by societal norms and sharing similar ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnic origin, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The criteria that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered “ferocious” or wild. Some wild children were confined by people (generally their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents’ rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability from which the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wilderness.
When fully raised by non-human species, feral children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, the support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but rather a way to help learners who are discovering new instruction, such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the Microsoft Office paperclip assistant.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, including extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, but that is the reality.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is intended to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster placement is intended to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaching uses and gratifications.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are considered major factors promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions lasting just a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, in particular, that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article “The President’s Speech,” noted how people unable to comprehend speech due to brain injury are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate variations between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in much the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively quiet alarm clock, in order to bring you back to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (particularly water or tea, known for their diuretic properties), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
A person’s level of inner peace is the opposite of the level of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awakened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods, and cultures brought an end to the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would witness real clashes, through proxy armies, on battlefields in both Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of the navy has been to ensure your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy’s ability to do the same.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using primarily U-boats, was attempting to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close by for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goatherds who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still practiced today.
"Wagonways" were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and haul heavier loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Crossbars were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with an iron band on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first mode of transportation was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (“upright man”).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as a matter of course.
Evidence of bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come.
In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment. However, if we don’t want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that problems have become more significant due to overpopulation and humanity’s extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few streets away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the “Dunlap Broadsides.”
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the earliest printed copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs covered in scales and equipped with claws, they lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like T-Rexes.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal poisoning is likely the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term originates from a historical familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs and reduviid bugs alike are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may very well believe that it is not in their interest, or in the child's interest, to take on the responsibility of raising a baby.
These couples can choose to pursue adoption for their baby.
In the context of an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one; experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism appeals to people who wish to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, especially the wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem are examples of on-site activities.
We can, for example, go see, photograph, and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Each morning, people leave small rural towns by car to get to their workplaces and encounter others who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle system, everyone is in a way connected to and supports a car-based transportation system.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from the state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert on each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable coherence and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Several thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km in width.
No less than 20% of the water that rivers around the planet discharge into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since antiquity, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, as they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It concerned rather the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these latter transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
We also find alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing methods has relegated the pen to a more private status and rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when the next innovation arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus from a myriad of protons and neutrons.
A bit like making a heavy cart climb a hill. By splitting the core again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what makes people feel good or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want to do the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues—at one end of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or “one of the girls”).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, conduct performance reviews, delegate responsibilities, and hold others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the group has created up to that point and do things their own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a genuine “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the management team to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization impose upon itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives linked to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently within an organization’s functional services, creativity and ingenuity can fully flourish.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provides material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it allows us to narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumors, and brain traumas affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never before seen.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks requiring intelligent approaches by machines.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These practices led to distinct disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been implemented in several home computer software programs and video games.
Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not feasible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can view ancient objects from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a magnificent work of art all while remaining seated with their class.
Participating virtually in an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future generations.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often start blogging with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience generally improves the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging “forces students to become more familiar with the world around them.” The need to generate public interest encourages students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used effectively, blogs "can help students strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively responding to online content, they can compare their opinions with those of others and express their own viewpoints on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find Niagara Falls, and to the north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings, which boast pristine natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, are what make Ontario the quintessential Canada in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent in its own right, when it comes to fauna.
Most small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury resort destinations.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands, and this religion spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, around the time Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route connecting Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels state that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding band (which shouldn't look too valuable).
Women need to realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviors they may consider harassment—such as being followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.—as this is often commonplace.
Be firm in refusing unwanted advances from men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had destroyed and then rebuilt it, renaming it Casa Branca (White House), finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and knick-knacks of all kinds, but that's about it for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the downtown area.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for gorilla trekking among the least expensive in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (moto taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for faraway and exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the key locations featured in Henry Louis Gates’s PBS series “Wonders of the African World.”
The city stands in stark contrast to those of the rest of the country, as it possesses a style more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park’s total area is 19,500 km², which is divided into 14 ecozones, each harboring specific wildlife.
This is one of the most well-known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees for the park.
It can be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card which provides access to certain parks in South Africa, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main attraction for many tourists.
The row of buildings outlining Hong Kong's horizon has been compared to a shimmering bar graph, revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront located opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land of the north shore.
This is the place that British colonists settled. Therefore, it seems to me to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland into Bangladeshi and Indian territory.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not composed solely of mangrove swamps: they also harbor some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², about one-third of which is covered by water/swampy areas.
Sundarbans has been a natural reserve since 1966, and you can find approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal vessels, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It overlooks the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, at which point the Brazilian customs checkpoints should be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes who populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, primarily survived through fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly nicknamed "the giant province of the Indies," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous populations.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Furthermore, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organized here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the neighboring islands, credit cards will likely not be accepted, although British and American currency might be. Discuss this in advance with the owners to agree on a method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange it before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, winter in the Northern Hemisphere corresponds to summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, and summer temperatures exceeding 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't really distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is fairly constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park’s animals are accustomed to seeing humans, they are nonetheless wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, bison, moose, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a famously frustrating naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated at a peaceful gathering in town during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland sits on two harbors. The most popular ones are found in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, often very popular with families, have numerous shops along the coastline. Swimming there is safe.
The main local beer is “Number One”, a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There’s also another local beer, “Manta”.
There are many French wines to savor, but New Zealand and Australian wines perhaps travel better.
You can safely drink the local tap water, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a “café crème” is foreign. A short black is an “espresso”, a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through them other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transportation, or even packages combining flights and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents necessary for your destination (such as a visa).
Any modification or request must however be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed campsite.
Don't forget that even though the main stage musical performances are over, other musical performances may continue late into the night at other festival locations.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises in the most exposed cabins.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. You rarely find windows or clocks there, and the exits can be difficult to spot.
They generally offer special deals on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and encourage them to stay.
On some sites, it's the locals who offer alcoholic drinks for free. Nevertheless, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know that staying sober is crucial.
Anyone traveling by car to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive as if you were on dry pavement.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic flows practically uninterruptedly all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable experience for many visitors.
In everyday language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African land, and particularly in the savanna, with the goal of witnessing the stunning spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and standard equipment allows for good observation of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you’ll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, walking safari, or hike) involves hiking, for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies no longer extended to July 2020, the date the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
By ironing damp clothes, you can dry them more easily. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if there isn't one in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you can find one.
Avoid letting the fabric overheat (which can cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it must be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are unfamiliar with from their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or, in the most severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In certain locations, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes make considerable savings, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through remote backcountry terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections – generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than before.
However, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common there: apples are baked and used in pastries all year round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but generous pastries, try Berliner doughnuts, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be “thick” or “thin,” depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia, comprised of 17,000 islands, means that Indonesian cuisine is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without further qualification, it tends to refer to foods originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with peanuts, chilies, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices being the predominant flavors favored by Javanese people.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: indeed, the user’s feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse bolts. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – the premier destination for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large and varied granite walls and cliffs.
From the highest peaks, the views of the mountains are breathtaking. Alpinists from all over the world are constantly discovering new navigable routes on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless.
Downhill winter sports, notably skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard attached to one’s feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many aficionados, sometimes called “ski bums,” who plan their entire vacations around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: some cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5,000 BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, Nordic skiing, or backcountry skiing.
It resembles alpine touring skiing, as well as mountaineering, without generally incorporating these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you’ll be able to cover slightly longer distances than on foot – but you will only rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it comprises many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries therefore involves having to make multiple visa applications and undergo multiple passport checks.
However, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain in this area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you don’t need to apply for a visa separately for each country within the area, which saves time, money, and administrative procedures.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on location; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than that in effect in Europe.
Handmade products can be considered antiques, even if they are not as old as similar industrially produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade holds great significance for many other professions.
Even though, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people practice modern professions. Tourism is a significant source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the term “Gitan” is often considered pejorative due to its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, your international health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East could face situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are merely a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Very unfavorable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on the geographical, topographical, and atmospheric characteristics.
Violent winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, just like thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Extreme weather phenomena, regional and seasonal, include cold snaps, blizzards with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to inquire about the risk of bad weather that may affect their destination area, knowing that this could impact their planned routes.
Anyone considering traveling to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Courses in hostile environments" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course would normally cover all the questions addressed here in much more detail, generally with hands-on experience.
A training course typically lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few and far between.
Travelers planning gender confirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender designation (X) or updated documents to reflect a preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is equally variable.
Security checkpoint searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to pass through scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents that flow back from breaking waves on the beach, often over a reef or similar obstruction.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast current towards the deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you exit the current, returning to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again. It's also possible that, depending on your skills and whether or not you've been spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who struggled to adapt to the new culture sometimes have a lot of difficulty readjusting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits from your original culture.
Initially, when you traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize how much patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and light show is like a history book.
The Sphinx is positioned as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples include Livingston and Deception Islands, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula blend into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km long range crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern section, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches a peak of 4892 m.
In remote areas, without cellular network coverage, you may have no choice but to use satellite phones.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace a cell phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It’s a service often used for navigation, including recreational boats, as well as by expeditions with needs for remote data transmission and telephony.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a gap year have the opportunity to learn through travel, and increasingly, they are choosing this option.
This formula is particularly popular with young people leaving school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their studies.
Often, having taken gap year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of being accepted into higher education in your home country.
Generally, an enrollment fee is required to take these educational programs.
Finland is a prime destination for recreational boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also boasts thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it’s a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises feature a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore on cruise excursions, you won't need a separate visa (as of 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
You shouldn't be ashamed: it's no different from the fears and anxieties that many people experience regarding other things.
For some, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on a lack of control.
Transportation companies are well-compensated for making fast deliveries. Very often, in the context of an urgent repair, the question of deadlines is crucial for the related documents, goods, or spare parts.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for smaller businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had shipped goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to clear unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won’t allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first or business class is to spend a large sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, to have your company pay for it).
However, it is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it is pointless to try to get discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware they can count on a certain type of traveler who is willing to pay a very high price for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million inhabitants, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent transit hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center, situated around a vast bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that more closely resembles the Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one finds interesting marble sculptures depicting doves on some graves.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk through this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located to the north, is easily accessible and was made famous among foreigners by Lord Byron’s brilliant account of its splendor.
Scotturb bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
When traveling north, be sure to visit the superb Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a world-renowned site for the apparitions of Mary.
Do not forget that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world’s population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their time here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews indiscriminately.
Please treat this site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes it as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the subway are only made in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris remains to behave as well as possible, to act like a well-mannered person. This will greatly facilitate your travels.
The Parisians’ brusque exteriors quickly disappear if you show a minimum of politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country boasts a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils, and altitudes.
The region is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the western capercaillie can be observed there, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls to women who arrive with nothing, but if you bring your own, and furthermore it features bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but as it isn't washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and utilizes olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
One could also say that it facilitates reading, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Please also ensure you pronounce "r" and "rr" in a distinct manner: "caro" means "dear," while "carro" means "cart."
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough to it that it isn't necessary to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn’t as much of a concern in their time, they are generally located in towns or on campuses, which were more accessible than those built in the modern era.
Most modern survey telescopes are enormous infrastructures located in remote regions with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the favored flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the close aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one."
If you visit a strictly maintained garden, collecting “specimens” will also get you expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost anything you need once you arrive.
However, located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to adapt to the heat (always) and strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube, or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important celebrations in Christianity, commemorating the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with these celebrations have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians worldwide.
It is traditional to stay up all night on Easter to watch the sunrise from an open space.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it's quite possible that it originates from a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into celebration at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands did so originally by water, swimming or on floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance separating them from the continent, mammals were unable to complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to admire the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for almost the entire day.
Since the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are classic work attire, and employees are addressed by their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain their supervisors’ approval for any decision they make and are expected to follow their supervisors’ instructions without asking questions.
