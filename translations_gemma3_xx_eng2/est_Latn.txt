In addition to proving that at least some dinosaurs had feathers – already a widespread theory – this allows us to see details that are usually invisible in fossils, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to researchers, the animal's plumage was chestnut-brown and its underside was light or yellowish-red.
The discovery allows a glimpse into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a fully developed rachis, known as a quill, but do possess other feather components – the vane and a fuzzy base to the vane – researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than the other parts.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers proposed that the sample represents adult plumage, not downy feathers from a hatchling, despite being from the tail of a young dinosaur.
Researchers hypothesized that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult plumage, not the down of a hatchling.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations of the Ambhur galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Andromeda galaxy.
Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy like a halo, and it consists of many small particles.

"Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with large openings in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey and an alumnus of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a technology-free experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper with the chosen candidate's name into an envelope.
After election officials verify the voter's identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The procedures for French election law are quite strictly formalized in legislation.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes in the box at the start of voting and that no other envelopes are added except those that have been properly accounted for and placed there by eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to monitor each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers under strict supervision, who follow specific instructions, will count the votes.

Police Deputy Chief Inspector D.K. Arya stated: “We have arrested five individuals who raped a Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
When the car hit the house, there were three people inside, but none of them were injured.
The driver still sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services freed the driver of a red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been held at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of his son.
He has been detained until charges are filed and the trial begins, but any eyewitness testimony may be of questionable value, as his image has been widely published.
Elsewhere in Great Britain, this is a common practice, but the legal system operates differently in Scotland, and courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when publishing photos of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be given until at least an indictment is presented.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants it to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that, after the agreement is signed, a military presence be secured in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow the military to leave after only five years.
Shooters participating in the additional pest control trial were closely monitored by forest wardens, as the trial was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited through the collaboration of NPWS and the New South Wales Shooting Association (NSW) for the shooting association's game program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of NPWS Parks’ conservation and cultural heritage, the four shooters selected for the first culling operation received thorough safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member interim electoral council yesterday.
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) under Martelly in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former president as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The trigger for sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which had been expected since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod failures due to overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
According to data from Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), there were 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as “not serious.”
In response, the ministry called Apple's report postponement "truly regrettable".
An earthquake struck near the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday evening).
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Office said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was neutralized while firing.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and made a career in medicine.
She trained to be an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women’s Hospital in 1959.
While Liggins worked at the hospital, he began researching premature birth in his free time.
Her research showed that administering a certain hormone to a fetus accelerates the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, or "black boxes," from the plane on Wednesday.
Even wrestling colleagues expressed respect for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna left us on a night of the full moon. Truly unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels commented, “Luna was as strange as I am… maybe even stranger… I love her and miss her… hopefully she’s in a better place now.”
Among 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic upon the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of survey respondents agree, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the results, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic at the first opportunity, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but their readiness is in doubt due to complaints.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs to get over the pain, as it is banned during the Olympic Games.
Mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, Curtis Cooper, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets supplied Earth with water, along with organic substances capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth quite some time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumours political lobbying and foolishness.
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon dioxide emissions each year.
Instead of relying on older, ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite-based technology, which allows air traffic controllers to determine the location of aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport is provided and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, furthermore there is no on-site parking and no “park and ride” facilities.
Fearing a lack of transportation, the possibility was raised that the game would be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday announced the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands, which belong to Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, despite the belief that this process would take much longer. The hybridization occurred between the endemic medium ground finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the immigrant large ground finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny designs.
It can be drawn into a fine wire, which can be twisted or braided into a plait. It can be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books, known as illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator for yourself with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions present in the chemical being investigated (H in pH does indeed represent hydrogen).
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze it into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a funny sensation and forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet, which was connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sanitation systems have been found in Crete, in the houses of Minoan culture cities, and in Greece, Santorini.
Toilets existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women mingled.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost immediately.
A rocket sent the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts light and the view.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most significant change the wheel has brought us is much easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to this, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transport.
At a lower level are medium-sized predators, whose diet consists of medium-sized prey, starting with hares and ending with antelopes and goats.
Finally, there are many small predators (including stray domestic cats) that consume a significantly larger number of small prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success lies in a niche concept, specific work that each cat does, which keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat family, living in large groups, known as prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and pups.
Females are usually very closely connected to each other, forming a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in many ways like wolf and dog packs – animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large felines) and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a versatile athlete, can climb (though not well), swim, leap across large distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four relatives can roar.
The tiger’s roar doesn’t resemble the lion’s loud roar, but rather a sentence shouted with growling words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible. Nearly all of the animals that an ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than itself.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find prey (victims) by scent, sniffing places where they have been.
Their night vision is excellent, and they also move very stealthily. The ocelot blends into its surroundings to hunt prey, then pounces on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originate from (for example, they move across a mountain range or river, or relocate to a new island, and returning is not easy), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In the new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population needs different characteristics than previously required and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still require the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and a new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to look increasingly different from the other population.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants make their own food from sunlight using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator of its time and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jawbones held over 70 incredibly sharp teeth, supplemented by additional teeth on the palate, meaning nothing that crossed his path escaped.
It is not known for certain, but mosasaurs may have had forked tongues. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may even have been man-eaters.
He attacked everyone who went into the water, even a gigantic dinosaur like a T-Rex wouldn't be any match for him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, dormice, and a rodent called the garden dormouse.
The second difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred banquets where they reclined while eating.
Ancient Roman foods could not have included ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god’s home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and priests attended to the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple has an open inner courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests may enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The tower's spire was a special sanctuary to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
The Jewish family conducted much of their life outdoors.
Women were cooking outdoors; shops were simply open counters facing the street. Houses were built of stone.
Canaan did not have any large forests, which made wood extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he travelled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the film “National Treasure,” you might assume that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words ""Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776"". The text is located at the bottom of the document, reversed and mirrored.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early years a large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ by 24 ½ inches) was kept rolled up.
It is likely that the note was simply added as a tag.
D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained still unfree.
The area was governed by Vichy French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
Allied forces landed in Southern France on August 15, 1940, an operation that came to be known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and liberated French forces had freed southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, or society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word *civilis*, meaning "relating to a citizen," which is connected to the Latin words *civis*, "citizen," and *civitas*, meaning "city or city-state," and to some extent also defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of countries. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge over multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and sufficient cultural diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies first formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, with Congress as its only branch.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authority of the states to enforce all laws, which were often not very cooperative.
He also lacked the authority to repeal tax laws and inter-state tariffs.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, alongside the German national football team, one of the most successful teams in the world, and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in this field at international and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that make up Japan, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago in geographical terms.
Taiwan was already mentioned in the 15th century, when passing European sailors wrote down the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning “beautiful island”.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain-production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) brought the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan under their control and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding governance of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures – namely, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic film format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly, its proportions were inherited by the dimensions of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusingly 36mm wide and 24mm long.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the group of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
Often misused and frequently ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics by maintaining a measure of order in a composition.
According to this, the most effective location is at the intersection of lines on the main subject, dividing the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, began to be carefully scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united the countries of Europe, despite the differences between their languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main tenets of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church financial resources are intended for precisely that purpose.
The center of ecclesiastical power had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth raised questions in many about whether this principle was being adhered to.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective – it cut off vital supplies to the military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which has been enshrined in numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom installed mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since this tactic did not elicit any special reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a large portion of citizens and peoples were pacifistically and isolationistically minded.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the war during and after World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job in New York City at the Edison Company.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his last job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each stage in Chinese history, or each ruling family, had a separate dynasty.
Similarly, there was an era of unstable, divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce fighting took place between many nobles who battled for the throne.
The Era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history – thousands of people died in internecine struggles, hoping to reach the highest position of power in the Xi'an imperial palace.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to a republic, to nationalism, and to the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a sole ruler.
Even after the Revolution, the fields of activity were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applied to the military, as instead of military ranks being based on class, they were now based on military merit.
The French Revolution also inspired representatives of the oppressed working class in many other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad felt a great interest in things deeper than worldly life. He had a habit of frequently going to meditate in a cave located on Mount Noori ('light'), which became known as Hira.
A cave weathered by time offers a vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, located on the peak of a mountain north of Mecca.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even knowing it exists. Once you're already inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but a clear, beautiful sky and numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be heard or seen inside the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many gigantic pyramid structures built to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, also known as the “Giza necropolis,” contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx in Egypt's Valley of the Dead.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "moor up" signal resembles a V-shape, and the "moor down" signal a bracket or square with its bottom side missing.
"“Up” means you should start from the frog and push, and “down” means you should start from the nut (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."
An upward stroke creates a softer sound, while a downward stroke is stronger and more forceful.
You are free to write down your markings, but keep in mind that the printed lines are there for a musical reason and should therefore be respected.
Frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), along with the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles for Paris on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and screaming threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a murdered royal guard of Versailles in front of the stunned queen.
The costs of the US imperialism's military conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover expenses and interest on debts incurred by the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the super-profits earned from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the elementary profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, and it was a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by agreement, is considered to end in the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses in practice a variety of ideas, ranging from technological impetus or technological imperative to a firm conviction that the fate of humanity is guided by the logic connected to the laws of science and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely shaped by cultural or political influences, and that technology itself exerts an influence on society that is more intrinsic than socially determined.
For example, one could say that the existence of motor vehicles certainly necessitates the development of roads.
However, the domestic road network is economically viable only with a small number of cars, therefore efforts are being made to develop new production methods to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership leads to a greater number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques for repairing damaged bodies in healthcare.
An important part of Romanticism was cultural determinism, which drew on writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and culture related to geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the location of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a place where all luxuries were concentrated began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were more valuable than those offered in the markets of Byzantium.
At that time, the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture characteristic of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most notable developments of this period, influenced by the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture in which food is produced in quantities sufficient only to meet the needs of the agricultural producer and their family.
Natural farming is a simple, often nature-based system where seeds sourced from that ecological region, crop rotation, or other relatively simple methods are used to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with similar ideas who feel that societal standards do not apply to them, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that allow a subculture to be distinguished can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through the use of a distinct and symbolic style, encompassing fashion, behavioral patterns, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus attention on the few unfortunate cases where adults failed to socialize children during their upbringing due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Children like these are called feral or wild children. People (often their parents) have kept wild children captive; in some cases, parents have abandoned a child due to a serious intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before abandonment or running away.
Others were reportedly raised by animals, and in some cases, it is said they lived independently in the wild.
If a child is raised entirely by an animal, the feral child (within physical limitations) will behave almost exactly like the animal that raised them, for example, they may fear humans or be indifferent towards them.
Although project-based learning should simplify acquisition and make it more interesting, an approach based on scaffolding in education goes a step further.
Scaffolding ('support') is not a teaching method, but rather a way to support people who are acquiring a new learning experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real – in other words, support can come from a teacher as well as the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual steps will be integrated into the software, with the aim of questioning, hinting at, and explaining procedures that may be too complex for a student to handle alone.
Children are taken to orphanages for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We find that foster families provide a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
A foster family should provide everything that was lacking in the home from which the child was previously removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal connection.
The unique characteristics of the internet introduce additional dimensions from the perspective of use and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socializing” are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” as new motivational aspects when researching audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds – microexpressions.
Primarily, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks highlighted in his article “The President’s Speech” that people who are unable to understand a speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately detect sincerity.
She even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior also exist in animals, for example, in domesticated dogs.
Studies conducted in the twentieth century have shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: latent and expressed.
With mutation, new genetic variation is added, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
With isolation and recombination, diversity fluctuates back and forth between two pools in each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive system similar to humans struggles to meet its amino acid needs using the available plants.
Moreover, if this fails to happen, it has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant-based sources would have been the proteins found in leafy greens and vegetables, but for primates like us, these are easily digestible only when cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
Taking all of this into account, we shouldn’t be surprised that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savanna.
Sleep interruption is a purposeful awakening process during a normal sleep period, followed by falling back asleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
It's simple if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness, but doesn't fully wake you up.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm while asleep, you might place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or the known diuretic tea) before bedtime in order to force yourself to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive the present life force. Everyone is capable of finding absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacles to reaching this goal are tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana path of love and various Indian yoga techniques.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Through drink poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened in Kundalini yoga.
The central practice of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a luminous consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the countries fell into conflict due to clashes of systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
This was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and authorized armies were to actually fight on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup around the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans almost immediately fell apart when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and defeated the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the conquest of Poland’s eastern territories, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for transporting goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to transport large volumes of people and cargo across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of navies has been to ensure a nation can move its people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy’s ability to do the same.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which primarily used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to gain easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that grazed on hillsides or other pastures, and were often herded by children or teenage goat herders, who are similar to the more well-known sheep herders. These herding methods are still used today.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling on them to achieve greater speeds and haul larger quantities than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, people began to understand that rails were more effective when iron strips were placed on top of them.
This became a common method, but iron wore down the wagon's wooden wheels more.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. The first rails made entirely of iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking – Homo erectus (or upright man) began to walk upright two million years ago.
For their ancestor, Australopithecus, walking upright was not habitual.
Examples of specialization for two legs can be found in australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can start living more environmentally friendly, join environmental movements, and even become activists.
Often, this is precisely like treating symptoms. But if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and neutralize it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humankind, and problems have grown larger due to overpopulation and humanity’s wasteful lifestyle.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, the manuscript of the resolution was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away, and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap copies.
John Nixon conducted the first public reading of the document on July 8th in Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 copies made by Dunlap are the oldest surviving specimens of the declaration. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have several characteristics that look like those of dinosaurs.
They have scaled and clawed feet, they lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in binary format.
A binary digit can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary numbers or – using computer slang – bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general and do not allow for an immediate diagnosis.
A clear sign of ingested or drunk poison can be an open medicine package or poisonous household chemicals located nearby.
Check the label for instructions on first aid for the specific poison.
Entomologists officially use the term Pentatomidae for this group of insects.
This term originates from a long-standing acquaintance with bedbugs, which have adapted extremely well to live as parasites on humans.
Both bird mites and bed bugs are nest-dwelling, adapted to life in a nest or a host's dwelling.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease affecting the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that the occurrence of MS is twice as likely in women as in men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in the best interests of either themselves or the child.
These couples may choose to give their child up for adoption.
Through adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to determine how the world works using the scientific method. In fact, this method forms the basis of most scientific research.
Scientific research, however, does not solely stem from experimentation – an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses – but also from asking questions and observing.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's scientific views, including those on psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from the philosophical and scientific roots of Greece.
Many observable rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on endogenous cycles and their creation through biological clocks.
The existence of periodic rhythms, which are not simply a reaction to external periodic factors, has been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating system that continues with a freely running cyclicality even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence indicating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, mutations elsewhere may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites to enjoy the views as well as wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, it would be visiting, photographing, and learning about Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and are in turn passed by others whose workplace is where they just departed from.
In this dynamic transport hub, everything is connected to and supports a transport system based on private vehicles in some way.
Science has now shown that this massive carbon dioxide-producing economy has shifted us away from one of the biosphere’s stable states that has been favorable to human evolution over the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints at a similar level about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate complaints about daily failures? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is a study that observes the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Studying traffic flows is unfortunately complex, as it is impossible to predict a driver's behaviour with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, therefore traffic flows tend to be somewhat reasonably consistent and can be broadly represented mathematically.
To better describe traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections contribute to the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to begin moving through the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies much more easily and find food and mates much more efficiently.
Most insects are able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects unable to rotate their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite – the solar system, along with the Sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, since you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world’s second longest and the world’s largest river in terms of discharge volume. It carries eight times more water than the world’s second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles in width in places.
20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Water flows into it from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the size of the Giza pyramids or the technical knowledge of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of a new state admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious services.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four aggregations of state (in the same order) – solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma – although he also speculated that they formed new substances that we see.
Alloys are fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have inclusions that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil, when first introduced, was a good friend to many.
The importance and use of the pencil have declined, as newer writing methods have unfortunately emerged.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to use a pencil sharpener.
One can only speculate what will happen to the keyboard when something new emerges.
A nuclear bomb works on the principle of taking energy to put the atomic nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Re-splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with a small nudge or spontaneously.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The Moon's outermost layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the back side.
It is thinner under the plains and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there may be more seas because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Achievement motivation theories attempt to understand what drives people to act and what they enjoy.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted during the process of maturing into adulthood.
These theories address what drives certain people to want to do the things they do, and what environmental factors lead these people to do or not do certain things.
The two most successful need-based theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
When managers start leading their former peers, it can generally elicit two types of behavior. One extreme of the spectrum tries to remain “one of the guys (or girls).”
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, enforce discipline, make assessments, assign tasks, and delegate responsibility to employees.
At the other end of the spectrum is a person who changes beyond recognition, feeling they must change everything the team has done so far and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is accountable for the team's success or failure.
Such behavior often causes discord between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same high standards as traditional teams, but there are still some small differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for their direct real-world group.
They typically have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that their local leadership may not understand.
The existence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The so-called invisible team is the administrative team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
What reason would a company have for undertaking the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of incorporating entrepreneurship learning concepts into activity is innovation.
When all available resources across functional departments throughout the organization are used efficiently, creativity and inventiveness begin to emerge.
As a result, the company's collaboration to overcome the obstacle may lead to a new, inventive process that meets the client's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help companies reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it delimits the field of research and makes it more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports researchers’ studies.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gave us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us better understand the processes happening in our brains.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, AI in its various forms is a very important branch of computer science dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves automating machines in such a way that they solve tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have evolved into separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions for real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been built into many personal computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every class. Teachers often would like to take students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution to this through virtual field trips. Students can view museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire fine arts while sitting in class.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned each year, but older versions are preserved as keepsakes.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. However, while students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
Similarly, "blogging compels students to get to know the world around them better." Attracting readers' attention encourages students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can determine their position in relation to the writings of others, and provide an overview of their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital and boasts a wide selection of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north stretches Muskoka and the pristine natural beauty of the areas beyond it.
All of the above and even more highlight Ontario as representative of Canada for foreigners.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and in places almost uninhabited wilderness.
To the surprise of many, a population comparison: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens in Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island and, in terms of fauna, practically a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became very popular in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that female travelers, regardless of marital status, state that they are married.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, something may be done that they consider harassment, and stalking, grabbing, etc. is not uncommon.
Tell men firmly no and don't be afraid to stay true to yourself (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. Phoenicians, Romans, and Maronites used it as a strategic port, known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the Old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather products, hookahs, and a whole range of various trinkets, but all of this is just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city’s streets, especially the downtown area.
If Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be investigated beforehand and the status of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province should be understood.
The town also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and additionally offers the most affordable opportunities for tracking mountain gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). A typical (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
Due to its relatively difficult accessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Timbuktu is a poor city, although its fame makes it an attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the most significant stops in Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s PBS special “Wonders of the African World.”
Compared to cities in other countries, this one is completely different, as it has more of an Arabic than African vibe.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River forming the southern boundary.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports a different type of wildlife.
This is one of South Africa’s prime attractions, considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all nature reserves in Southern Africa, daily conservation and entrance fees apply in this park as well.
It may also be useful to purchase a visitor’s card, the Wild Card, which allows entry to certain parks in South Africa or all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is a place many tourists consider the main attraction.
The row of buildings shaping Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to glittering bar graphs reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To best see Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon shoreline opposite it.
A large portion of Hong Kong Island’s urban development projects are located densely on land along the northern coastline.
This is a place that British colonizers took for themselves. Therefore, it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial period of the territory.
Sundarbans is the world’s largest coastal mangrove forest, extending inland from the coast 80 km (50 miles) into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are, however, not only mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remaining powerful jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The area of Sundarbans is 3850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has also been a wildlife sanctuary, and the area is currently estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inner-city bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those travelling east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since buses between city districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase your ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paros (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers reach a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two 3.5-meter wide lanes.
The bridge's underpass height is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plans, the bridge will be fully open for traffic in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani indigenous people were the most significant group of natives who inhabited the areas of present-day eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters, also practicing agriculture for sustenance.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived thanks to hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay emerged from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous peoples, formerly known as the giant province of the Indies.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character.
It is well known that Argentinian water polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December on the clay courts of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
See tournament news and information about tickets for practice matches on the Asociación Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at a one-to-one value with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands’ only bank, located opposite the FIC West store in Stanleys.
Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and at Stanleys, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on outlying islands, although British and US currency may be; check with owners beforehand to determine the appropriate method of payment.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is almost impossible, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30 °C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combined create a colder feeling than shown on the thermometer.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, it is still a wild environment and should not be disturbed.
According to park authorities, you should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how calm they may appear, bison, wapiti, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don’t keep a safe distance. These are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals, so leave them the space they need.
You should also be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook strongly scented foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
A notorious maritime strike of 1889 took place in the port, where seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships except one British cruiser sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the Mau movement's struggle for freedom, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the killing of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is bounded by two harbors, there are many beaches there. The most popular of these are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay (in the north) to Devonport (in the south).
These are almost all the sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and in most of them, tall pine trees provide shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded beaches intended for family holidays, lined with a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One, whose taste isn't complex, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called Manta.
There may be many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be more suitable for travel.
Local tap water is perfectly drinkable, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the “flat white” coffee is a foreign concept. “Short black” is espresso, and cappuccino is served with a mound of cream (not foam), and tea is offered without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips are made to the coral reef throughout the year, and it rarely happens that any of them cause damage to the reef.
However, heed the authorities, follow all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish occur near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town called 1770. Occasionally, they can also be found outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live entirely in the ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives the traveler peace of mind knowing they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can find other accommodation options through a travel agency as well, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your booking if you want to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes and requests should first be discussed with the travel organizer, not directly with the hotel.
For some music festivals, most attendees choose to camp on-site and consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Keep in mind that while the main stage may no longer play music, the festival may have other stages with music playing until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas designated for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check where your cabin is located, as icebreaking creates quite a lot of noise for nearby cabins.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to keep guests there as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. They typically lack windows and clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings to keep guests in good spirits and prevent them from leaving.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, being drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know that it's important to stay sober.
Anyone traveling at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive the same way as you would on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short period of time to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in several countries, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa is likely safaris, which are the highlight of the trip for many visitors.
The popularly used concept of "safari" refers to overland journeys with the goal of discovering African wildlife, especially in savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to cars, and standard equipment is sufficient for observing them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are easier to see with binoculars.
A safari walk (in English, it is also referred to as a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of a trek that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies based on coronavirus no longer apply to events scheduled for July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to take place.
The price of most tickets is expected to be between 2500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with standard tickets costing around 7000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if it's not in your room.
If you don't have an iron handy, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties from certain locations.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes may sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch of Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing landscapes with isolated woodland hollows.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, drive carefully: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sudden turns are common.
Speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – typically 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h) – and adhering to them strictly is even more important than usual.
Surprisingly, however, mobile service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the trail, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and those in Bavaria are plentiful and diverse, resembling those of its southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked into the pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you're craving a rich, sweet pastry, try the one known as a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, combined with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be dry or liquid, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the peninsula, coconut milk is generally used.
Indonesian cuisine is a general term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country, offering a choice from among 17,000 islands.
But when used without further qualification, this term tends to refer to food originally from the central and eastern parts of Java's main island.
Javanese cuisine, widely available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes, with peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices being the favored seasonings of Javanese people.
The footrests hanging on either side of the saddle are intended to support the rider's feet.
These help the rider maintain better balance, but can be dangerous as the rider's legs can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot remains caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag them along as it runs away. To reduce this danger, precautions should be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety features that allow the stirrup to detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backwards.
Cochamo, a primary climbing destination in Chile known as the "Yosemite of South America," features a variety of large granite cliffs and rock formations.
Breathtaking views open up from the peaks of the mountain ridges. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes on these cliffs with endless potential.
Mountain snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of descending a snow-covered surface on skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity among many enthusiasts, occasionally known as “ski-bums,” who plan their entire vacation around skiing in one specific location.
Skiing is very old – skiers have been depicted in cave paintings as far back as 5000 years BC!
Skiing as a sport was practiced as early as the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related to backcountry skiing or mountaineering, but doesn't usually include them. Backcountry skiing or mountaineering is typically done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots for it.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover somewhat greater distances than when walking, but despite the well-maintained trails, you will rarely achieve a cross-country skiing speed comparable to skiing without a backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, yet it has many independent countries. Usually, travelling through multiple countries means applying for visas and going through passport control multiple times.
However, in this matter, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a single country.
As long as you remain within this zone, it is fundamentally possible to cross borders without going through passport control again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition to determine which produced goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are over 100 years old.
The definition varies in different geographical regions; for example, in places like North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be called antiques, even though they are not as old as comparable mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for many Sami people, and the culture associated with trade is also important for representatives of many other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami engaged in extensive reindeer herding, but rather lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as beasts of burden.
Nowadays, many Sami people work in modern commerce. In the Sami region of Lapland, tourism is an important source of income.
Although the word "mustlane" is widely used, especially by those who are not Roma, it is often considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If travel advice is in place for the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance or travel disruption insurance.
Perhaps you would prefer to consult with a different government instead of our own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens may face different situations in the Middle East compared to Europeans or Arabs.
State travel advisories are merely a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The presented views are often superficial, generalized, and overly simplified, compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious societal disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they come in various types, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are extreme weather phenomena, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of all the hazards of severe weather conditions affecting the area, as it may impact travel plans.
Anyone planning a trip to a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for a hostile environment course will likely result in the address of a local company.
The course typically covers the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 3–5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training as well.
Books and magazines dealing with the sustainability of wildlife are common, but publications covering war zones are scarce.
Passengers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
Governments’ willingness to issue passports that do not indicate gender (X), or documents that have been updated to reflect a desired name or gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents also varies greatly.
Searches at security checkpoints have become much more thorough since September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through security checks without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
With rip currents, the water flow bounces back from the shore, often off a sandbar or something similar.
Due to underwater landforms, the returning current flows into a couple of deeper spots, where a swift current can form, heading into the deep waters.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from swimming against the current, as it can be an impossible task.
As soon as you are out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to move somewhere it won't drag you back in, or if you don't have enough skill and have been spotted, you can wait for the rescue team.
The shock of readjustment comes sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter there), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your habits from your native culture.
Initially, people were likely patient and understanding with those arriving from foreign lands, knowing that travelers needed time to adjust to the new country.
People may not realize that returning travelers might need patience and understanding.
For children, the pyramid’s sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in this area.
Before the performance begins, you will see pyramids in the darkness and can observe them in silence.
Usually, you can always hear the voices of tourists and merchants. Sound and light tell a story just like a storybook does.
The Sphinx has been made into a backdrop for spectacle and a narrator of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated with lights.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several countries and host the highest number of bases – 16 active bases as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the mainland. The largest island is King George's Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among these are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a remarkable natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peninsula’s mountains merge here with the plains, then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
At the base of the Sentinel Range lie the highest mountains of Antarctica – the Vinson Massif – with Mount Vinson, its highest peak, reaching a height of 4892 m.
In remote locations with no mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones do not usually replace mobile phones, as you need to be outdoors, with a clear view of the satellite, to make a phone call.
The service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, but also by expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for gap year planners is to travel and study.
It is particularly popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before university without negatively impacting their educational path.
In many cases, studying a course abroad during a gap year can improve your chances of continuing your higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees are generally charged for registration in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boating. This land of the so-called thousand lakes also has a thousand islands, located both in the lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to sail between islands and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks allow for a different kind of experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven to eight people.
Comparable figures exist in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is a unique phenomenon (for example, in the Netherlands it is one in forty).
Most diverse Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stop in Russia, in St. Petersburg.
This means you have a couple of full days to visit the historical city, while also being able to return to the ship overnight and sleep there.
If you visit the shore only on ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some travel brochure highlights the German city of Berlin. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located anywhere near the sea and a visit to this city is not included in the tour price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it's their first flight or they have had traumatic experiences in the past.
There's no need to be ashamed of this; it doesn't differ from the personal fears and aversions many people have towards other things.
For some, understanding the principles of how aircraft work and what happens during flight can help overcome fear based on ignorance or a lack of control.
Courier companies are well-compensated for the fast delivery of packages. Often, time is crucial for business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for smaller companies, there were problems.
When goods were sent by air freight, some routes could take days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get this through faster was to send it as registered baggage. The airline's rules don't allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class is to shell out a large sum of money for that luxury (or even better, have your company pay for it).
However, it's not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times as much for business class and 11 times as much for first class as you would for a regular economy class ticket!
Generally, it's not even worth looking for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are very well aware that there is a group of flyers willing to pay a large amount of money for the luxury of flying somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict in eastern Moldova led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between the two parts of Moldova despite failures in political negotiations.
Moldova's main religion is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, with a population of nearly 3.7 million, and is home to the second largest port after Istanbul, making it a very good transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located on the shore of a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are adorned with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century bazaar, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European than a traditional Turkish atmosphere.
From the village of Haldarsvík, there is a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and a rare octagonal church is located here.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble dove sculptures above some graves.
It's worth taking half an hour of your time to wander around this interesting city.
To the north lies the easily accessible, romantic and charming small town of Sintra, which became known among foreigners after Lord Byron brilliantly described its enchantments.
Scotturb bus number 403 often travels to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca along the way.
To the north, also visit the Sanctuary of Fátima, a world-famous site of Marian apparitions.
Keep in mind that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and that this place holds almost immeasurable significance for a considerable portion of the world’s population.
Even today, there are still men and women alive who have outlived the time spent here, and even more whose beloved ones were killed here or worked to death, whether they were Jewish or not.
Treat this place with all the dignity, sanctity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the place by defacing its structures with marker or scratching them.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language according to the law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
In the metro, announcements are regularly made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are reported by an automated system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
It is a common opinion that Parisians are self-centered, arrogant, and full of themselves.
Although often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave as politely as possible, holding yourself as a “bien élevé” (well-mannered) person. This makes getting around significantly easier.
The Parisians' rude attitude quickly disappears when you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of mountain and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts a remarkably wide diversity of plant species due to its varied microclimates, soils, and altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely diverse collection of animal and bird species.
Here, in addition to many common species, you can also find rare animals such as the Eurasian brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and black grouse.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear knee-length skirts and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries do offer wraps to unprepared women, but if you have something of your own with you, especially if it’s brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Men must also wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also rent these at the entrance, but the garments aren't washed after each use, so wearing their skirts might not be pleasant. For men, one size fits all!
Mallorca cuisine, like other Mediterranean cuisines, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses a lot of olive oil.
Especially in summer, Pa amb Oli – bread with olive oil, tomato, and other available toppings like cheese, tuna, etc. – is a beloved simple dinner.
All nouns, including the word "Sie" ('you'), always begin with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between a verb and an object.
Allegedly, this makes reading easier, although writing is again more difficult, as one needs to figure out whether a verb or adjective is being used as a noun.
Italian pronunciation is quite simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also, definitely pronounce r and rr differently: caro means "expensive", but carro means "cart".
Persian grammar is relatively simple and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it’s easier to learn Portuguese.
Although people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Observatories preceding the modern era are now usually outdated and remain in use as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution wasn't such a problem during their heyday, they are usually located in cities or university towns and are easier to access than those built more recently.
Most modern scientific telescopes are extremely large facilities located in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea originates from China, where the chosen flower was plum blossoms.
The first cherry blossom viewing parties were hosted in Japan by the emperor, and they were intended only for him and other aristocrats of the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so refrain from taking even a single specimen.
If you visit a formally designed garden, you will be thrown out without discussion for picking "samples".
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, and it’s very easy to get around, plus you can buy almost anything there after arriving.
However, being located just a few degrees north of the equator in what are known as the high tropics, you have to cope with both the heat (all the time) and strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, less often).
Some buses also go north to Hebron, which is the traditional burial place of biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Please check that the bus you plan to use goes to Hebron, and not only as far as the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The area around inland waterways is a good place to spend your vacation.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise along the interesting cities of the Danube, or travel by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also guide the routes of popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the customs of this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It has become a tradition to spend Easter night awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigil services on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island did so by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Because the mainland is far away, mammals could not make the journey, which is why giant tortoises are the primary herbivores on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark almost 24 hours a day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is rarely a problem there, it is possible to enjoy the stars there as well.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are standard work attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Workplace harmony is essential, and the emphasis should be placed more on teamwork than on celebrating individual achievements.
Employees often need to get their supervisor's approval before making any decisions and must follow the supervisor's instructions without question.
