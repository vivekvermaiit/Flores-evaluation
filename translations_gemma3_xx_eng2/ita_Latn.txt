USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity for the Olympic community to work to create a safe environment for all of its athletes.
We agree with what was stated by USOC, namely that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and of their sport, can be better served by pursuing significant change within our organization, and not through decertification.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely circulated, but provides more detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, this animal’s plumage was chestnut brown on the upperparts, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the underparts.
The discovery also allows for obtaining detailed information regarding the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur’s plumage lacks the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead exhibits other characteristics typical of feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis is likely the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests it wasn’t used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship displays. Researchers hypothesize that, despite being a tail from a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not downy feathers from a hatchling.
According to researchers' hypotheses, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals plumage from an adult specimen and not that of a hatchling.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and wounding over twenty people.

They discovered that the workings of the Sun are based on the same fundamental principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined by nothing other than their luminosity and rotation.
Brightness is used along with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less stellar activity there is relative to magnetic inversions.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attractive force on the Earth that generates tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to infer that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that “normal” matter has.
This theory posits that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was “highly concerning and alarming, due to the high mortality rate.”
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the microbe within the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers at the hospital itself.
Over the course of a year, one infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.

Infrared images show thermal fluctuations between day and night, suggesting these are likely caves.
During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the team of astrogeologists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, stated: "Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After verifying their identity by officials, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral law codifies procedures in a rather strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can attest that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no others are inserted besides those of voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send their representatives to attend every stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will require facial reconstructive surgery.
Uka's weapon did not fire when aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider is in constant pain, is blind in one eye, is missing a section of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video conference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the Championships.
She was first in the slalom, but recorded a DNF (Did Not Finish) in the first run. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the course.
In the other race she participated in, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's "seated" category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth place held by Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers were unable to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
The Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Despite this, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed, while emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that moment on, Adekoya was at the Edinburgh sheriff court charged with murdering his own son.
She is being held pending trial and prosecution, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be compromised, as her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish law has different parameters. Scottish courts have in fact considered the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspected individuals are walking on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for criminal prosecutions, has told journalists that no further comment will be released until the formal indictment.
According to leaks, the document will concern the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to reports, other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to relinquish that presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for pest control had to be carefully monitored by rangers, as the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received thorough safety training and instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in to a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) comprised of nine members.
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission deemed Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October and challenge the regime, insufficient.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled as far back as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated it was aware of 27 incidents linked to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
In its response, the ministry defined Apple's postponement of the report as "absolutely deplorable."
The earthquake tremor at the Marianas was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage has been reported in the nation.
And furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami occurring.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was fatally shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After completing her training in obstetrics, she began working at Auckland’s National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in his free time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
Her research has shown that administering a hormone would accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" containing flight recordings.
His wrestling colleagues also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
“Luna was as strange as me… Maybe even more so… I love her and I’ll miss her… Hopefully she’s in a better place,” was the comment from Dustin “Goldust” Runnels.
According to a poll conducted on 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of survey participants, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
Contrasting views in the poll show that 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never do so.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but reported several ailments that led to doubts about their fitness.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth – that is, matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and, in particular, how Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
According to him, the speculations are nothing more than "empty talk and political nonsense."
A candidacy for the presidency in 2016 is being considered.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system utilizes satellite technology rather than the outdated ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged, and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there is no parking available on site or park-and-ride facilities.
Concerns regarding the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds has reportedly been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, United States, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in as little as two generations, although it was previously thought that much more time would be required for this process; this was due to mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into any kind of shape. It can be rolled to create tiny forms.
It can be drawn into a thin thread, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of its ability to be rendered so thin.
This refers to the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice, it is possible to build a pH indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the analyzed chemical substance is determined by the quantity of hydrogen ions present (the letter H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, shape them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will occur that will cause a strange sensation and form a sort of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced drainage system.
In Greece, remains of sewer systems have been discovered in the dwellings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets existed in ancient times also in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, they were sometimes included in public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite launch into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and visibility.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket taller than 100 feet is necessary.
The wheel has enormously changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is having provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile, and several other means of transport came into being.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including feral domestic cats) that feed on small prey, much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of a niche is the secret to their success—a specific focus that each feline has, allowing it to avoid competition with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called prides.
The packs are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and pups that can reach up to 30.
Usually, the females are closely related to one another, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion pride acts in a very similar way to a wolf or dog pack, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly analogous to that of lions (but not to that of other large felines), even regarding fatal attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is capable of climbing (though not very well), swimming, making very long jumps, and exerting a pulling force five times greater than that of a strongman.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t as powerful as the lion’s, but it sounds more like a sentence of shouted, furious words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
Thanks to night vision, I am able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots camouflage themselves with their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making a return difficult), it will likely find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, therefore, to establish itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need characteristics or transformations different from those previously necessary.
The original population hasn't changed at all; it continues to need the same adjustments as before.
As time passes and the new population adapts to its new environment, it increasingly resembles the other population less and less.
At a certain point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by them (through exhalation).
Plants produce their own nourishment using sunlight through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses starting from plants and produce clothes with plants. A large part of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time and for this reason feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws protruded more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row located on the palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible he was a cannibal.
He attacked anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex wouldn't have been able to compete with him.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also featured several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference lay in the fact that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men loved to feast together while reclining on their side as they consumed their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include several foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the god's dwelling.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate characteristic of the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
A large part of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard, while the shops were simple open-air stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Nordic sagas recount that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his voyage after being exiled from Iceland for manslaughter.
But, regardless of its discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Despite all being “Scandinavian” countries, the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the film "The Templar Mystery," you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence July 4th 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not certain who wrote it, it is well known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had brought the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France: this offensive action was named "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a specific culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word “civilization” derives from the Latin “civilis,” which means civil; the term is in turn connected with “civis,” meaning citizen, and “civitas,” meaning city or city-state, and in a way thus also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states were the first entities to anticipate the idea of the nation. A culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge across generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and are therefore not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and Congress was its only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, it relied on the state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
To amend the articles, unanimous consent from all states was required. These, for their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, alongside the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among the most popular sports are: soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical standpoint, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago" due to its composition of groups of islands.
Taiwan emerged in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by soon after recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation that affected the grain production systems of the indigenous people and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thereby ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, notably the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
A large part of the suburban buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today, and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35mm format is 24mm and its width is 36mm.
Therefore, the proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) are considered to be 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
In this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had acted as a unifying force between European states, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
His omnipresent power influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's financial reserves exist precisely for this purpose.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it involved interrupting any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law, as generally accepted and codified by numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, also endangering neutral ships.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of much of the citizenry and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China, or each family in power, constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division among the provinces. The most well-known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these times, fierce wars erupted among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to secure a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since army rankings are now based on merit rather than class.
The French Revolution was a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in questions that went beyond earthly life. He often went to a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave sits atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not at all easy to find, even though its existence was known. Once inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
One sees nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a great number of mountains all around. From inside the cave, very little of the surrounding world can be seen or heard.
Among the Seven Wonders of the World, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one to have survived to the present day without being in ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Giza), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family.
The "arched up" indication resembles a V, and the "arched down" indication resembles a paperclip or a square missing its bottom side.
Upward means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means you should start from the grip (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An ascending bow stroke usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow stroke results in a louder, more assertive sound.
You can choose to add your own pencil markings, but keep in mind that the bowing marks you find printed have musical significance, and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, age 11, and Louis Charles, age 4), and Elisabeth, the king's sister.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and screaming threats at the monarchs.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The costs of the U.S. imperialism's wars to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Clearly, the enormous profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits underlying American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period in European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally concludes around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the strict sense according to which the destiny of man is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
A large part of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology has “effects” on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can state that the automobile necessarily entails a development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
The mass ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently to the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a significant component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, traditions, and culture linked to that geography have arisen which, being in harmony with the societal context, proved more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a hub of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its prestige diminished, mainly because the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was reached between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But the slowness of communication routes means that the diffusion of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era, resulting from the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence farming when it is practiced solely to produce enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses seeds preserved from the local ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing yields.
Historically, the majority of farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with shared beliefs who don’t feel represented by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Often, members of a subculture signal their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods for explaining the importance of socialization is to analyze unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, as a result of misfortune, or due to intentional abuse, grew up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been isolated by people (often their own parents): in certain cases, abandonment is motivated by the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, they exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more engaging, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a learning modality, but rather an aid for those embarking on a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the small paperclip-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to prompt, encourage, and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, and even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that doesn’t guarantee them nourishment, care, and education, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care represents a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
It is assumed that foster care will meet all the unmet needs of the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications theory.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation: “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships.”
The use of video recording has allowed for significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even claims that such skills in interpreting human behavior could be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, new genetic variability is added; with selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet their amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savanna.
Furthermore, the failure to implement these activities has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, even death.
The plant resources most easily accessible would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
Animal foods, however (such as ants, termites, and eggs), are not only easy to digest but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during normal sleep, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily implemented using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without fully waking you up.
Should you decide to reset the alarm while drowsy, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include consuming plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces you to get up to urinate.
A person experiences inner peace in proportion to the opposing tension existing in their body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the existing life force is. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is hindered only by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
Generally speaking, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is founded on Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts caused a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies; thus began the Cold War.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been truly fought, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been breached; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans quickly proved obsolete, however, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Utilizing ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and merchandise across the oceans.
Historically, the mission of navies has always been to guarantee the country's ability to transport people and goods, while simultaneously countering the same ability of enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples supporting this theory, and most noteworthy, is represented by the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans sought to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using primarily submarines, attempted to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany would likely have had the opportunity to conquer Great Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
They began to be raised by ancient cultures and tribes for the easy availability of milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were typically raised in herds allowed to roam freely on hillsides or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds (similar to shepherds) who were frequently children or adolescents. These herding methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Despite being simply constructed from parallel wooden planks, wagonways, when compared to the slightly more uneven roads of the period, allowed horses traveling on them to reach greater speeds and move heavier loads.
Cross ties were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, even though iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first means of transport that humans discovered were their legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
His predecessor, the australopithecine, did not usually walk upright.
Evidence of specialization for bipedal gait is present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can begin to adopt more environmentally friendly lifestyles, join the environmental movement, and even engage in activism.
In many cases, this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If, however, we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, while problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall, and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9th, while a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 broadsides of Dunlap currently known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive—those we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds share many characteristics with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have scaled feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers is at the core of all computers currently in use.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main sign of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of an open container of medication or harmful chemicals.
Check if the label has first aid instructions specific to that poison.
The term "mite" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term originates from the historical familiarity with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become human parasites.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for approximately 400,000 known cases, ranking it as the leading neurological disease affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has highlighted that the probability of developing MS is twice as high in females compared to males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or in the best interest of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method effectively guides most scientific inquiry.
But it’s not just about experimentation, given that an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations helps to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are decisively dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not merely reactions to external periodic signals, in a large part of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free-running cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, that is viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, labeling the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
Only mutations that occur in germ cells can be passed on to offspring; mutations that happen elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Among the examples of activities to do on site are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks, and the study of information regarding the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small countryside towns to commute to work by car, passing others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic coming and going, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which they simultaneously support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its stable conditions that allowed for human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transportation systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints regarding water quality or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
"Traffic Flow" (or "traffic flow") is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another, and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Luckily, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably consistent range, and as a result, traffic flows tend to exhibit reasonable stability and can be generically represented mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing, and managing road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily escape enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
A large proportion of insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Of all the insects existing today, the only ones unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many others believed the opposite – namely, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don’t get the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries a volume of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of up to six miles in some places.
20% of the total water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller tributaries flow into it.
Pyramids continued to be built of stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is made up of approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the world's smallest independent state and the one with the smallest population.
The official language of Vatican City for legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people who work within the State, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to become familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper in ancient times: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and can be extracted quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These in fact resemble more the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and increasingly less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has the need to reach for a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons underlies the operation of the fission bomb.
Basically, it's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Therefore, by further dividing the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The maria might be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner there, which facilitated the ascent of lava to the surface.
Theories about content focus on identifying what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people develop certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites certain people and drives them to want to do what they do, and what contextual factors in their lives push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most widespread theories on content, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory stand out.
Generally, when managers start leading their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it complicated to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, and define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager transforms into a completely different person, feeling the need to change the team's entire approach and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is similar to that of traditional teams, but with some small differences.
Members of the virtual team often act as a point of contact for their respective physical teams.
They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can occur according to various time zones, which may not be accommodated by local management.
The existence of a genuine “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is defined as the management team to which each member refers and which sets the standards for each member.
What reason would an organization have to undertake the lengthy process of building a learning organization? A good reason to implement the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the collaborative process within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process for satisfying customer needs.
For an organization to be considered innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The area of research becomes more restricted and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is at the heart of scientists’ research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors can affect behavior and alter specific mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never observed before.
This offers us a great amount of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
Research on AI includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some application examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are frequently used today in the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Teachers often wish to take their students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned each year, but previous versions are kept online and become an archive.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Their first experiences with blogs are often characterized by poor grammar and spelling, but generally, having an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative feedback the blogger strives to improve their writing.
Blogs also “force students to become more aware of the moment surrounding them.” The need to fuel public interest motivates students to be ingenious and engaging (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs “can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south you'll find Niagara Falls, and to the north you can admire the natural and pristine beauty of the Muskoka region, and so much more.
All of this and more is what makes Ontario typically Canadian, according to foreign opinions.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, among these some are wild, almost uninhabited moorlands.
If you compare the populations, the result may be surprising for many: the number of African American citizens in the United States is higher than the total number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its natural heritage makes it a continent unto itself.
Almost all of the minor islands, known as luxurious beach resorts, are largely independent nations or associated with France.
In those lands, the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey towards Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travelers: it is recommended that all declare they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is important for women to realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they themselves consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the strength to reject men, and don’t be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; known as Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name Casa Branca (White House), which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city originally called Daru l-Badya, later named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who chose this location for their trading bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
Around the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a lot of trinkets, but all of this is reserved for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city’s roads, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to thoroughly research any trips outside of Goma in order to properly assess the state of the clashes that still persist in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
It is possible to use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" ultimately became a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a decayed city, but due to its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, and also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
It was a major stop on Henry Louis Gates’ PBS special “Wonders of the African World.”
With a touch more Arabic than African, the city clearly distinguishes itself from the others in the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends eastward along the border with Mozambique, borders Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern boundary is formed by the Crocodile River.
Covering an area of 19,500 km², the park encompasses 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a diverse wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily conservation fees and park entrance fees are required.
Purchasing a Wild Card could also be beneficial, as it grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, represents the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form Hong Kong’s skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart, even more striking as it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront across the harbor.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has concentrated on the reclaimed land of the densely populated northern shore.
This is the place the English colonists chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of this land’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included within Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², about a third of which consists of wetland areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary; the area is estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since buses running between different districts are often full, it would be wise to purchase your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy little Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, in Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
Its two pylons have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge, the clear vertical space is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic only occurred in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The great province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can attend smaller tournaments and matches even at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and to purchase tickets for polo matches, please contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The Falkland Islands have their own official currency, the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is valued at par with the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It’s likely that credit cards won’t be accepted on the more remote islands, although British and US currency may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It’s virtually impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures over 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates the sensation of a temperature lower than what the thermometer reads.
There aren’t defined “dry” and “rainy” seasons: the amount of rainfall remains pretty constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's animals are accustomed to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears—practically all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not maintaining an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals sufficient space as they are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with strong odors, and try to keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population numbers just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port occurred the sadly famous naval stalemate of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the paramount chief.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are spread across three areas.
The beaches facing the Pacific Ocean on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are beaches suitable for families, sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can swim safely here.
The most well-known local beer is a simple, pleasant, and refreshing beer called "Number One." The other local beer is called "Manta."
You can find many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the 'flat white' coffee originated from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is a short black coffee, the cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is as good as the Belgian one. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions are carried out on the coral reef, and injuries due to this cause on the coral reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow the instructions, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear from October to April near beaches and river mouths north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of river estuaries north of Rockhampton, and they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often make agreements with specific hotels, but it is still possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers to/from the airport, or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain further documents required for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted to the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
On the occasion of some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, it’s necessary to arrive early and secure a spot near the music.
Remember that once the music ends on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as ice crossing causes rather annoying noises for those most exposed to it.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time for exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted a visa exemption (terms and conditions apply).
Generally, casinos do everything they can to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. Typically, there are neither windows nor clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer food, drinks, and exclusive entertainment to keep guests' spirits high and encourage them to stay.
In some establishments, alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures near freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it’s not possible to drive as you would on clean asphalt.
During a blizzard, so much snow can fall in such a short time that you can get stuck.
Precipitation and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle's windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the centerpiece of many visitors’ vacations.
In its popular usage, the term "safari" refers to trips undertaken by land, particularly in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars more closely, therefore standard equipment is sufficient to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or a "walking" safari) is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations scattered throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, with the first Games having taken place in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, however most cancellation policies related to coronavirus, as of late March 2020, do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most event tickets is expected to range between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes can speed up their drying. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not available in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one available.
Pay attention to not exposing the fabrics to excessively high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water, and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, many minutes are required.
The effectiveness of filters is variable, therefore in case of doubts it is advisable to consider purchasing bottled water in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst cases, trigger allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save quite a bit, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions, as it frequently passes through secluded areas amidst dense vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes peeled, as steep slopes, narrow roads, and tight bends are common.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those enforced on the preceding and following sections (typically 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Strict adherence to them is extremely important.
Strangely enough, however, in this area the level of mobile phone service coverage is much higher than in other parts of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rather flavorful and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit pastries are a timeless classic, from those with apples available year-round to those with cherries and plums, which appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes often pair very well with a strong cup of coffee.
Anyone wishing to taste small but flavorful pastries can opt for those known, depending on the region, as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either “dry” or “wet,” depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used for curries in inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more frequently used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a broad one encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern areas of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of simply prepared dishes; its predominant flavors come from the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability for the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a jockey is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged by the runaway horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most knights wore riding boots equipped with a heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially English ones, incorporated safety bars, which cause a leather stirrup to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it backwards.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of enormous granite walls and cliffs can be found.
The peaks of the summits include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continuously forge new routes on its seemingly endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve gliding on snow using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts numerous enthusiasts, sometimes even referred to as "ski bums" (literally, "the ski dropouts"), who dedicate entire vacation periods to skiing in a particular resort area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski trekking.
It is connected, even though she usually doesn't understand them, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require skis and boots that are much stiffer.
Think of a ski slope as a path similar to a hiking trail.
If conditions are good, you will be able to cover distances somewhat greater than those traveled on foot, but you will only very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but comprised of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries one would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, regarding this aspect, the Schengen Area functions rather like a single country.
If you remain within this area, it is normally possible to travel from one border to another without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money, and bureaucracy.
There isn't a universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider an object to be such if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition exhibits geographical differences regarding the age limit, which can be lower, as is the case in North America compared to Europe.
Handicraft items could be defined as antiques, even if more recent than similar mass-produced objects.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture upon which this trade is based also underpins many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi were always involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Today, many Sámi pursue modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the land of the Sámi.
Even though widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a mistaken perception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for your destination, it could impact your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
You might also be interested in the opinions of governments different from your own, but keep in mind that those opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
To give an example, American citizens in the Middle East might encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
These notices simply constitute a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to indicate any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in every part of the world, and there are different types, depending on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, above-normal precipitation, and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similarly to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the intense regional and seasonal weather phenomena are thunderstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may impact travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
Searching online for 'Hostile Environment Awareness Training' will likely yield the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A course typically lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, while publications focusing on war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The intention on the part of governments to issue passports without indications regarding sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Even security checks and inspections have become much more thorough in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to pass through security checks without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are formed by the backflow of breaking waves on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topography, the return flow concentrates in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you're out of the current, returning to swimming won't be any more difficult than usual.
Try to find an area where you won't risk being trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue, based on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
Re-entry shock manifests in a shorter timeframe than culture shock (having a reduced "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of the customs of your original culture.
In your first experience abroad, you likely met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people didn't imagine that patience and awareness were also necessary for those returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the show begins, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally, you always hear the noise made by tourists and vendors. The spectacle of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long tale.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception Island; on the latter, the caldera of an still-active volcano filled with water has created a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula and facing the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km range bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, lacking cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone generally doesn’t replace a cell phone, because to make a call you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including yachts, as well as by missions requiring data and voice communication over long distances.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information regarding connection to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among recent high school graduates, as they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to one’s home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, both within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Even though coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly vast enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather unusual occurrence (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
A large portion of the various Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For disembarkation, a separate visa will not be required (as of 2009) when using onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can frighten people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There’s nothing to be ashamed of: it’s no different from the fears and dislikes that many people express towards other things.
For some people, understanding a little about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown, or on the feeling of having no control.
Couriers are well-paid to deliver products quickly. Often, timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, larger companies use their own planes, but problems arose for other routes and in the case of smaller companies.
On some routes, air shipments would have taken days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked baggage. And that’s where you come in, since airline regulations don’t allow shipping baggage without a passenger.
To fly in first or business class, the most obvious way is to shell out a hefty sum for the privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to pay for it).
However, the price to pay is high: you can expect to shell out up to four times the normal economy fare for Business class travel and up to eleven times the fare for First class!
Generally, it's not even worth looking for discounts on first or business class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and consequently they apply certain fares.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that in the past was the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two zones of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna developed on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains, and currently constitutes a modern, evolved, and active commercial center.
Although the city breathes an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than to that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are dotted with the characteristic red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik, you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and visit a unique octagonal church.
On the church forecourt, on some of the tombs, there are some interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the enchanting village.
To the north lies the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible. It became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
Scotturb line 403 bus regularly runs to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always head north to visit the grand sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a place of worship), a site of Marian apparitions celebrated throughout the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is fundamentally a mass grave, and holds almost immeasurable significance for a large portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by scribbling on or painting graffiti on the structures.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half the population prefers to speak Catalan, and the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
On the subway, routine announcements are only in Catalan. Any unplanned service disruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, thanks to an automated system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it’s often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to have a good experience in Paris remains to behave with the utmost politeness, interacting as a “bien élevé” (well-mannered) person. This will definitely make your travels easier.
The Parisians’ rough exterior will quickly disappear if you display some basic good manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly beech, spruce and fir trees, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils, and different altitude levels, it exhibits a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
In these areas live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie, alongside several other more common animal species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it’s brightly colored, you’ll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants reaching below the knee.
These items can also be borrowed from the storage room at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil extensively.
Pa amb Oli is a simple, popular supper, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" used for the formal "you," always begin with a capital letter, even when they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect likely facilitates reading as well, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form makes the writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes based on the vowel that follows.
Also, be sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: *caro* means beloved, while *carro* means carriage.
Persian possesses a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could be very helpful with Persian grammar and in understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with even a basic knowledge of Spanish may jump to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is similar enough and therefore doesn't need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, premodern observatories usually appear obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't a problem during their golden age as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes used for research are enormous structures in remote areas where the atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the blossoming of plum trees was favored.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants thrive when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting a few plant specimens will result in being removed from the premises, without discussion.
Generally, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around; you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
But being in the “high tropics,” just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll have to contend with the heat (always) and the strong sun (less frequently, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north, towards Hebron, the traditional site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives, were buried.
Make sure the bus you intend to take reaches inside Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a vacation.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to visit the interesting cities along the Danube, or sail on the Erie Canal.
Furthermore, they define the routes of well-known hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas represents one of the most important festivals of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
A large part of the traditions linked to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition dictates spending Easter night awake in an outdoor location in order to admire the sunrise.
Of course, there are naturally Christian theological explanations underlying this tradition, but it could just as easily be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, an Easter vigil is frequently celebrated on the night of Saturday of the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because the distance from the mainland was considerable, mammals were unable to make the journey. This led to the giant tortoise becoming the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced to the Galapagos Islands after the arrival of humans.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility of witnessing the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark for almost the entire day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution often isn't a problem and you can even enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are typically accustomed to.
Office attire typically consists of a suit and tie, or a suit for women, and colleagues are addressed by their last name or professional title.
Workplace harmony is crucial, as it emphasizes team commitment rather than celebrating individual achievements.
Workers often need to receive approval from their superiors regarding every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
