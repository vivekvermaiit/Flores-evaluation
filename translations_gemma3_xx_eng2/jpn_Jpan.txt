This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also conveys details—such as color and spatial arrangement—that are generally not found in fossils.
According to scientists, this animal’s feathers were chestnut-colored on the outside and warm-toned colors on the inside.
This discovery also provided clues for exploring the evolution of bird feathers.
Although dinosaur feathers lack a fully developed central shaft called a rachis, they possess characteristics common to feathers such as plumulaceous barbs and barbules, leading researchers to speculate that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
Based on the structure of the feathers, it is speculated that they were used for thermoregulation and visual effect rather than for flight. Researchers have suggested that the specimen shows adult feathers, not chick down, despite being a young dinosaur’s tail.
Researchers suggest that despite this specimen being a young dinosaur’s tail, it bears adult feathers rather than down feathers.

Uka's weapon misfired, aimed at the head of the fifth man. Schneider experienced pain, lost an eye, had a portion of his skull missing, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from his home country’s U.S. Air Force base.
After the Wednesday event, Karpaned participated in two individual races at the championships.
The first race was a slalom, but she retired (Did Not Finish) during her first run. In this race, 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result.
In the other race, the giant slalom, she finished 10th in the women’s sitting group with a combined time of 4 minutes 41.30 seconds, 2 minutes 11.60 seconds behind Austria’s Claudia Loesch in 1st place, and 1 minute 09.02 seconds behind Hungary’s Gyongyi Dani in 9th place.
In the women's sitting group, four skiers were unable to finish their runs, and in the giant slalom, 45 out of a total of 117 skiers failed to rank.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Police Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated, “Five people have been arrested for the rape of a Swiss woman, and her mobile phone and laptop have been recovered.”
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjhar, Bhuta Kanjhar, Lampro Kanjhar, Gaza Kanjhar, and Vishnu Kanjhar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendant appeared in court with their face covered.
Three people were inside the house when the car crashed, but no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed to traffic until paramedics rescued the driver from a red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Mr. Adekoya subsequently appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of his son.
She is being detained pending indictment and trial, but due to her photo being widely publicized, there is a possibility that witness testimony could be compromised.
While this is common practice in other parts of the UK, the Scottish legal system differs, and courts there view the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University points out that journalists who publish photos of suspects, etc., are "crossing a dangerous bridge."
The Criminal Affairs Division of the Supreme Court, which is fully in charge of the prosecution, has indicated to the press that it will refrain from further comment until an indictment is made at least.
According to information I overheard, the document in question refers to a border dispute, and Palestine’s hope is based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
It is also reported that the discussions covered the future state of Jerusalem, a sacred place for both countries, and issues in the Jordan Valley.
Israel is reportedly seeking a 10-year continuation of its presence in the valley if this agreement is reached, while the Palestinian Authority has only agreed to a 5-year period of stay.
The supplemental pest control tests were monitored and their effectiveness evaluated, so the shooters participating in these tests were under strict observation by rangers.
Through a partnership between NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the NSW Sports Shooting Association, qualified volunteers are being sought for the Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director-General of the Parks Conservation and Heritage Division, cooperating with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial culling operation reportedly received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Marterie was sworn in as a member of the new ad-hoc Election Management Board (CEP) comprised of nine members.
For Maruteri, this is their fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous European Commission as part of measures to mobilize the country for new elections.
This committee was President Martelly’s response to the widespread protests that began against the government in October.
This protest movement, which sometimes turns violent, began after the planned elections were not held, starting in 2011.
There have been approximately 60 reports of overheating issues with faulty iPods, resulting in a total of 6 fires and 4 people suffering minor burns.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it has confirmed 27 accidents related to the equipment have occurred.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that an additional 34 overheating incidents, which Apple claims are “not serious,” have been reported.
The ministry responded by stating it was "truly regrettable" regarding Apple's delay in submitting its report.
This earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
According to the Emergency Management Office (EMO) of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported nationwide.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no indications of a tsunami.
In the Philippine capital of Manila, a former Filipino police officer has hijacked a bus and is holding Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Roland Mendoza opened fire on tourists with an M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued, but at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, and Filipino photographers were also released.
The photographers became substitutes for an elderly woman who desired to go to a place of impurity; Mendoza was shot dead.
Rigins followed in his father’s footsteps and went down the path of medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Ligins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research revealed that administering hormones accelerates fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also showed their respect for her.
Tommy Dreamer says, “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was also my first manager. Luna passed away on a night when there were two moons out – a pretty unique night, much like her. She was a strong woman.”
Dustin “Golddust” Runnels commented, “Luna was as messed up as I was… maybe even more so… I loved her, and I miss her… if I could have it my way, I’d want her to be in Heaven with me.”
A poll of 1400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election showed an 8% increase in opposition to an Australian republic compared to 2008.
Julia Gillard, as interim Prime Minister, argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
According to opinion polls, 34% of people agree with this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
A public opinion poll showed polarized results, with 29% believing Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% believing it should not.
That Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but their health is in question due to symptoms they reported experiencing.
Because the medication he needed to suppress the pain was banned at the competition, he couldn't take it.
Central Missouri State University mathematician and computer scientist Professor Curtis Cooper discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
This discovery was verified by several people using different hardware and software by early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have delivered organic molecules—including those that form proteins and support life—and could have been a source of Earth’s water.
Scientists want to understand how planets, and especially Earth, were formed since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called this rumor "political chatter and foolishness."
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims NextGen is a system that enables aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
Employing satellite-based technology, in contrast to conventional ground-based radar technology, allows air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There are no special transport provisions, ground-level trains do not stop at Wembley, and there is no parking or park-and-ride facilities at ground level.
Concerns about the lack of transportation options have led to the possibility of being forced to play matches in a closed venue with a poor turnout of team supporters.
A study published in the academic journal *Science* on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that this new species evolved in just two generations, but this process was thought to take much longer due to being the result of hybridization between the native Galapagos finch and the introduced large cactus finch.
Gold is a metal that can be processed into any shape. It can also be rounded and made small.
It can be drawn out into a wire shape and then twisted or woven. If flattened or rolled, it can also become sheet-like.
It can be stretched incredibly thinly and affixed to other metals—so thin, in fact, that it’s sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations known as “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make litmus paper using purple cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice reacts to chemicals, changing color depending on whether they are acidic or alkaline (basic).
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) contained in the chemical substance being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton with its electron removed (because a hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron).
Combine the two dry powders, knead them in a circular motion, and firmly grip with clean, wet hands.
Moisture on the hands reacts with the outer layer, creating a strange sensation and forming a shell-like substance.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, sewage systems were developed, and almost all residences had flush toilets.
Remains of sewage systems have been discovered in the houses of Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During the Roman civilization, they were sometimes included as part of communal bathhouse facilities.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, the call is automatically routed via satellite.
Satellites in space receive phone calls and reflect them almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. The reason scientists use telescopes in space is because some of the light and scenery that enters human vision is distorted by the Earth's atmosphere.
To launch satellites or telescopes and deploy them in space, you first need a massive rocket over 100 feet tall.
This wheel unbelievably changed the world. Its greatest achievement was making transportation far more comfortable and faster.
Trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation originated from there.
Below that, there are many medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to serow and deer.
Finally, a large number of small cats (including feral cats) live here, preying on a far greater number of smaller animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of a niche – each cat has a specific job, ensuring they don't compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related males and over 30 females and their offspring.
Typically, the females are related to each other by blood, forming large families consisting of sisters and daughters.
A lion’s pride exhibits behaviors similar to those of wolf or dog packs, and the animals are remarkably alike in behavior to lions (and other big cats), ensuring they don’t miss their prey.
The tiger, with its remarkably well-proportioned body and high athletic ability, can climb (though not skillfully), swim, leap long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars all belong to the same animal group (the panther genus). Only these four types of large cats are capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar isn't like a lion's bellow, but rather a roar that feels more like an intimidating threat.
Ocelots readily eat small animals. If possible, they will also catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Most of the prey ocelots hunt are creatures much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe ocelots search for and chase animals that may become prey by sniffing the ground to find where they have passed.
With its high night vision capabilities, it has excellent night sight and is also adept at moving stealthily. Ocelots blend into their surroundings and hunt by leaping onto their prey.
When a small population of organisms (with a limited number of individuals) becomes separated from the larger population it belonged to—for example, by moving across mountains or rivers, or to a new island from which it's difficult to return—it will often find itself in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, with different resources and different competitors, the new population will require different characteristics and adaptations than those previously needed, potentially becoming a powerful competitor.
The original group hasn't changed at all and still requires adaptation, just as it did in the past.
As a new group begins to adapt to a new environment, it will gradually begin to exhibit characteristics different from other groups over time.
Ultimately, in thousands to millions of years, the two populations will become so different in appearance that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create the oxygen that humans breathe in, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants create nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses with plants and make clothes from them. Many of the foods we eat daily come from plants. Animals cannot live without plants.
Because mosasaurs were apex predators of their time, they had no rivals to fear other than other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is lined with over 70 sharp teeth, and another row of teeth is present on the palate – meaning once something goes in, there’s no escape.
While it's not certain, it may have had a forked tongue. It likely ate turtles and large fish, and there’s also a possibility it was cannibalistic, meaning it ate other mosasaurs.
Also, it will attack anything that enters the water, and even a massive dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex wouldn't stand a chance.
While most of their food is familiar to us, Romans ate exotic and unusual delicacies such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and even a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference was that poor people and women preferred to sit on chairs to eat, while wealthy men favored banquets where they reclined and relaxed while dining.
Ingredients that would later be brought to Europe from the Americas and Asia over the following centuries could not have been included in the diet of ancient Rome.
For example, there was no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, and no cocoa there, and ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god’s home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests attempted to fulfill the gods' desires through rituals and festivals.
Each temple featured an open courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, as part of temples, special pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
For people living in the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not particularly important.
The Hebrew families lived mostly outdoors.
The women were cooking in the garden, and the shops were nothing more than stalls facing the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
Because the Land of Canaan did not have large forests, wood was very expensive and valuable.
Greenland was a sparsely populated region. According to Nordic tradition, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter and, when he sailed west, discovered and named Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
While every country is considered “Scandinavian,” there were considerable differences in the national character, monarchy, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
Anyone who has seen the movie "National Treasure" might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that wasn’t the case. There was something written on the back, but it wasn’t a treasure map.
What was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence was the title "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The title is written upside down at the end of the document.
While the author is unknown, it is known that this large parchment (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was stored rolled up during its early use.
Therefore, notation tends to be simply added as a label.
While the Normandy landings (D-Day) and subsequent battles liberated Northern France, the South remained under occupation.
The rulers were the French of “Vichy.” They made peace with the German army in 1940 and were French people who collaborated with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded Southern France, an invasion known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture—or, in other words, a society—shared by a large group of people who live and work together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin adjective *civilis*, meaning citizen, and is related to the Latin noun *civis*, also meaning citizen, and the noun *civitas*, which refers to cities or city-states and in some way defines the scale of a society.
City-states are precursors to the nation-state. Civilization and culture signify the inheritance of knowledge over numerous generations, the continuation of a cultural legacy, and its just dissemination.
Cultures that deviate from the mainstream often disappear without being recognized as legitimate civilizations, and as a result, historical evidence is lost.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, with the Confederation Congress as its sole component.
Because the legislature lacked the power to tax and had no executive or judicial branches of its own, it relied on state authorities for all of its actions, but state authorities were often uncooperative.
They also had no authority to invalidate interstate tax laws or tariffs.
Amending the clauses required unanimous consent from all states, but as each state often disregarded the central government, representatives were frequently absent.
The Italian national soccer team is the second most successful team in the world, alongside the German national team, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing, among others.
In the northern regions, winter sports are popular, and they have produced Italian athletes who participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan consists of approximately 7,000 islands, the largest of which is the Honshu archipelago, and it is considered the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan is a collection of islands, and is therefore geographically often called an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century when European sailors referred to the island as "Ilha Formosa," meaning "Beautiful Island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming the grain production methods of the indigenous people and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki and ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan.
Machu Picchu is comprised of three main structures: the Intihuatana (sunstone), the Temple of the Sun (Torreón), and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to learn more about their traditional appearance.
Machu Picchu was 30% restored by 1976 and continues to undergo restoration work to this day.
For example, the most widely used still photography film format in the world is 35mm, which became the mainstream film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio carries on the format of digital camera image sensors.
It's a bit confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, this aspect ratio (found by dividing by 12 to get the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common recording formats (such as those based on APS) have this same or a similar aspect ratio.
The "rule of thirds" is sometimes dismissed, but it’s a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining order in a visual composition.
The most effective positions to place the main subject are considered to be within the areas surrounded by the intersections of lines that divide the image into thirds both horizontally and vertically (see example).
During this period, the Catholic Church, which had become economically prosperous and a powerful force in European history, was increasingly subject to scrutiny.
Christianity has connected European countries with different languages and customs for over a thousand years.
That universal force affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds exist specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and with the concentration of power and funds there, many have begun to question whether its doctrines are being fulfilled.
Shortly after hostile actions began, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
While this strategy was effective in cutting off the supply of critical military and civilian goods, the blockade violated international law, which had been codified and generally recognized over the past two centuries through numerous international agreements.
Great Britain laid mines in the open sea to prevent ships from entering all ocean areas, thereby endangering even neutral vessels.
Because the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany anticipated a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the ideologies prevalent among most citizens and the nation were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the devastation and brutality of war during World War I, each country hoped to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States to take a job at Edison's company in New York.
Carrying a single volume of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (my former mentor) to Thomas Edison, I traveled to America with almost no money.
In ancient China, there was a unique method of indicating temporal differences, and each stage in Chinese history, or the families holding power, became characterized as distinct dynasties.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there were unstable periods of fragmented local rule. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years and was sandwiched between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In such times, many nobles engaged in fierce battles over the throne.
Romance of the Three Kingdoms depicts one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of warriors battling for supremacy and the highest position in the imperial palace of Xi'an.
There were many socio-political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, patriotism, and the belief that the country belongs to its people, not a single ruler.
After the revolution, all jobs became open to public application, with all men eligible to apply, and those most motivated and successful in the selection process were able to obtain positions.
The same can be said of the military, because it has become a hierarchy based on ability rather than one based on rank within the military.
The French Revolution inspired many working-class people in other countries who were under oppression, and revolutions began in various nations.
Muhammad had a deep interest in issues beyond the concerns of daily life. He frequently visited a cave called “Hira” on Mount “Nur” (light) for meditation.
The cave, preserved through the ages, vividly reflects the depth of Muhammad's spiritual devotion.
The cave is located on a mountaintop north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
In reality, even knowing a cave exists doesn't make it easy to find. Once inside the cave, it's a completely isolated space.
Looking up, all you can see is the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains; from within the cave, the outside world is barely visible, and its sounds are almost imperceptible.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid structures built to enshrine deceased pharaohs.
Spread across the Valley of the Dead in Egypt is the Giza Plateau (the Giza necropolis), featuring numerous pyramids—the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Giza—along with several smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was a massive tomb built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples surrounding it were dedicated to Khufu’s wives and family.
The upward-facing bow mark looks like a "V" shape, while the downward-facing bow mark resembles a staple or a square with its base missing.
Upbow is starting from the tip and pushing the bow, while downbow is starting from the frog (where the hand holds the bow) and pulling the bow.
Raising the bow typically produces a softer sound, while lowering the bow creates a stronger, more assertive tone.
You can freely write symbols in pencil, but remember that printed arc symbols have musical reasons. You should generally follow those symbols.
On October 6, 1789, a terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), along with the King’s sister, Princess Elizabeth, were forcibly returned from the Palace of Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
Riding in a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a mob who shouted and hurled threats at the king and queen.
The crowd, turned into a mob, forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
Once, before the terrified Queen, a rioter brandished the head of a royal guard killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The Filipino people bore the costs of the war and conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism.
They were unexpectedly subjected to taxation under the American colonial government to cover the majority of expenditures, and were also forced to pay interest on bonds sold in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the excess profits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipino people undoubtedly constituted a foundational profit for US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context in which the order arose.
The period in which this incident occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, generally corresponding to the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) in European history.
The High Middle Ages is considered the period between the Early and Late Middle Ages as a historical era, and it is customary to consider the Late Middle Ages to have ended by 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that actually encompasses a wide range of ideas, from promoting technology and technical norms to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common assumptions: one is that the development of technology follows a path largely independent of cultural and political influences, and the other is that technology is not socially conditioned but rather “influences” the inherent nature of society.
For example, it might be said that the development of automobiles inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, because only a small number of cars cannot justify a nationwide road network, new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The increase in car ownership leads to a rise in traffic accident rates, which in turn results in the development of new technologies in the medical field to treat resulting injuries.
Within Romanticism, a major element existed called cultural determinism, formed by authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and customs and cultures relating to that geography arose over time, harmonizing with the social sphere and proving superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as a fashion center in the modern world, Constantinople flourished as a fashion center in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center for luxurious costumes began around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly due to the return of soldiers from the Crusades bearing gifts such as silk and spices more valuable than those found in Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The height of the Gothic style was in the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Its initial style was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication routes, Western styles may be 25-30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the biggest advancements of the time, resulting from the Crusades, was the beginning of using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of farming where agricultural workers and their families produce only enough food to meet their own needs.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple system that aims to maximize yields by combining preserved seeds native to the ecosystem region with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques, and is often organic farming.
Historically, the majority of farmers have practiced subsistence agriculture, and this trend is still seen in many developing countries.
Subculture is a culture formed by like-minded individuals who feel ostracized and undervalued by societal norms, allowing them to cultivate their individuality.
The characteristics of subcultures can be determined by factors such as the age, ethnicity, class, location, and gender of its members.
The characteristics that define subculture may be language, beauty, religion, politics, sex, geography, or a combination of those elements.
Members of subcultures often demonstrate their affiliation through distinctive and symbolic styles—including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to cite the few unfortunate cases of children whose adaptation to society was hindered during their development by parental neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Children like this are called "feral children" or "wild children." Feral children may have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents), and reasons for this abandonment can include a parent's refusal to care for a child with severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
There are those who are said to have been raised by animals, and others who are said to have survived on their own in the wild.
Children raised by animals other than humans and growing up in the wild exhibit behaviors—within physical limitations—very similar to those of the animals that raised them, such as fearing humans or being indifferent to them.
Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further than that.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support for people who are using new computer programs, starting new projects, or having new learning experiences.
Scaffolding exists in both virtual and real forms. In other words, teachers are a form of scaffolding, and so are the clip art characters in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffold is integrated into this software with the aim of allowing students to ask questions, receive instructions, and obtain explanations for procedures they might find difficult to do on their own.
The reasons children are placed in foster care vary widely, ranging from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
Every child should grow up in an environment with proper nurturing, care, and education, but feral children are raised without those things.
We recognize the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
The foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, nurturing childcare, secure education, and reliable medical care.
Foster care is intended to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the child's previous home.
The internet is an environment that combines both mass communication and interpersonal communication elements.
A notable characteristic of the internet is that it elicits further dimensions from the perspectives of usage and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” have been suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were identified by Eighmey & McCord (1998) as novel motivational facets when investigating audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording is leading to important discoveries in interpreting subtle facial movements—microexpressions that last only a few milliseconds.
They claim that you can tell if a person is lying by accurately interpreting their微表情 (microexpressions).
Oliver Sacks points out in his paper “The President’s Speech” that even people with brain damage who cannot understand speech can correctly assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such an ability to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals like domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century revealed that genetic variation exists in two gene pools: one hidden and one expressed.
New genetic variations are introduced through mutation, and natural selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Niche partitioning and recombination shuffle variation as generations alternate between two pools.
For primates with digestive systems similar to humans, it is difficult to obtain essential amino acids from the plant resources available in savanna environments.
Moreover, neglecting it can lead to serious consequences such as growth retardation and malnutrition, ultimately resulting in death.
The most readily available plant-based resource was protein found in leaves and legumes, but this is a nutrient that is difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
On the other hand, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and are a high-quality protein source containing all essential amino acids.
Considering all points, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the “protein problem” just as chimpanzees living in today’s savannas do.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep time, staying awake for a period (10-60 minutes), and then falling back asleep.
This can be easily done by gently rousing your awareness without fully waking up, using a relatively quiet alarm clock.
If you realize you're unconsciously turning off your alarm, one trick is to place the clock on the opposite side of the room so you have to get out of bed to stop it.
As other methods based on biorhythms, there’s things like deliberately drinking plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or diuretic teas) to create a situation where you inevitably have to wake up to urinate.
The degree to which one feels peace of mind is inversely proportional to the degree of physical and mental tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force is created. Everyone possesses the potential to discover absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing preventing this goal is one's own anxiety and negative feelings.
Tibetan Buddhism is a faith based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by incorporating many techniques from Mahayana Buddhism's compassion and Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of loving-kindness towards all.
Kundalini Yoga is a practice that combines yoga poses, breathwork, mantras, mudras, and other techniques to awaken the kundalini—your inherent spiritual energy.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment arises.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the two countries became antagonistic due to clashes in systems, processes, and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemy nations, and the Cold War eventually began.
After that, it continued for 40 years, leading to genuine wars fought by proxy armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had already collapsed, and its only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were quickly rendered obsolete overnight. After more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army invaded Poland’s eastern territories – in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties (both bilateral and multilateral) – they formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts.
Transporting goods by ship is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
Traditionally, the Navy’s task has been to maintain the ability to transport one’s own citizens and supplies while reliably disrupting the enemy’s ability to do the same.
A prominent recent example is the North Atlantic operation of World War II, where the United States attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was attempting to intercept this transport, primarily using U-boats.
If the Allied Powers had lost, Germany likely would have been able to conquer Britain just like the other countries in Europe.
The domestication of goats is believed to have begun around 10,000 years ago, with its center in the western Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep goats, as they readily provided milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Traditionally, livestock goats were free-range grazed on hillsides and other pastures, and the goatherds tending to the flocks were typically boys. This custom continues even today.
In Britain, waggonways were already being laid as early as the 16th century.
The track for the freight cars was simply made by laying planks side by side, but by having horses pull carts along it, they could transport larger loads at higher speeds than was possible on the somewhat rough roads of the time.
Railroad ties were introduced quite early on to fix the rails in their designated positions. Eventually, it was gradually discovered that adding iron tips to the top improved efficiency.
While this became commonplace, iron caused increased wear on the wooden wheels of carriages.
Ultimately, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, all-iron rails were introduced for the first time.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and human bipedalism began with the emergence of *Homo erectus* ("upright man") around 2 million years ago.
Our direct ancestors, Australopithecus, did not have a habit of continuing bipedal walking for extended periods of time.
Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, but the characteristics of bipedalism are confirmed in Australopithecus fossils from 3.9 to 4.2 million years ago.
You could start a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, participate in environmental movements, or even become an activist to lessen future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is like treating the symptoms rather than the cause. However, we need to identify the root cause of the problem and neutralize it, rather than simply seeking temporary solutions.
It is a plainly obvious fact that the world has changed dramatically due to the advancement of human science and technology, and problems have expanded due to overpopulation and luxurious lifestyles.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
Approximately 150 to 200 copies were reproduced overnight, and are now known as "Dunnlap broadsides."
The first public reading of this document was performed by John Nixon in the Independence Hall garden on July 8th.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th and read aloud to the troops in New York on July 9th. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 extant Dunlap broadsides are the oldest copies of the document still in existence. The original handwritten versions no longer survive.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today—we call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, even now, the appearance of birds still resembles dinosaurs in many ways.
It has scaled and clawed feet, is ovoviviparous, and walks on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
In effect, all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in binary.
Binary numbers are represented by one of two values (0 or 1), and these numbers are called binary digits or bits for use in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning isn't always immediately apparent. Because symptoms like vomiting are common, a diagnosis cannot be made right away.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning is open containers of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label of the poison and see if there are any first aid instructions for that specific poison.
Entomologists are using the term "insect" in its formal, scientific sense when referring to this group of insects.
This name originates from the fact that bed bugs have long been prevalent in bedding as highly adaptable pests that parasitize humans.
Bed bugs and kissing bugs are both ectoparasites that have adapted to live in the nests or dwellings of their hosts – they are nest-dwelling.
In the United States, it is estimated that around 400,000 people have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
According to research, women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
Some couples may decide that raising children isn't beneficial for either parent or child.
Couples like this can utilize the adoption system for their baby.
In adoption, biological parents lose their parental rights, and another couple can become the child's legal parents.
The main purpose of science is to elucidate how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
However, it's not just that. An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations also serve as guidance for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers paid attention to classical texts, particularly the Bible written in Latin.
What was accepted were Aristotle's views on all matters concerning science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, Western nations realized they were becoming disconnected from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are critically dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and the mechanisms timed by the internal clock.
Circadian rhythms are documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and are not simply a response to periodic cues from the outside world.
The body clock is an autonomous oscillator that continues to cycle freely for a certain period of time, even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important experiments suggesting that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages (viruses) to transplant their DNA into bacteria.
They attempted two experiments: one to label the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and the other to label the phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations occurring in germ cells are inherited by offspring, while mutations occurring in other tissues can lead to cell death or cancer.
Tourism that emphasizes interaction with nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild flora and fauna.
Examples of activities in the field include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and researching information about ecosystems.
As an example, you could go meet orangutans on Borneo, take pictures, and learn about them.
Every morning, people leaving a small rural town on their way to work pass by those who have their workplaces near their starting point.
In this dynamic round-trip transportation system, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private vehicles in some way.
Science now shows that we have shifted the biosphere out of one of the stable states that has supported human evolution over the past two million years, by this massive carbon economy.
Everyone who participates in social life uses transportation. And almost all of them have complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about things like water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints and break down so frequently? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is there a more fundamental problem at play?
Traffic flow research is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because we cannot predict the actions of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent framework, and therefore, traffic flow tends to have a degree of rational coherence that can be roughly represented mathematically.
To more accurately represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships will be helpful in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky. The ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings flat along their bodies.
This expands the range of narrow spaces available for hiding from predators.
Currently, the only insects unable to fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a scholar named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
While some people acknowledged his theory as correct, many believed the opposite – that the sun (and other stars) revolved around the Earth in the solar system.
Since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, this seems reasonable, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, with a water discharge more than eight times greater than the second largest river.
The Amazon River is the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching a width of 6 miles.
20% of the water flowing from rivers on Earth into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River's main stream stretches 6,387 km (3,980 miles) in length. This river gathers its flow from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza surpassed all others in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The people of the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt were amazed by predecessor monuments built over a thousand years prior.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the world's smallest independent country and also the least populous country.
In Vatican City, Italian is used in laws and official communications.
The language most commonly used in daily life by those who work in Vatican City is Italian, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper were valued by people since ancient times, and all can be found in nature in their natural forms and relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This resembles the four states of matter – solid, liquid, gas, and plasma – in that order, but his theory also posited that they transform into new substances to form everything we see in this world.
An alloy is, fundamentally, a mixture of two or more metals. Think of all the elements listed on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Additionally, those containing a very small amount of nonmetallic elements such as carbon are also classified as alloys.
Everything that exists in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could potentially fit within the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencils that emerged onto the scene back then were good friends to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the status and uses of pencils gradually declined.
Now, more people type messages on computer screens, and pencil sharpeners are no longer necessary.
I wonder what will happen to keyboards if even newer things come out.
Nuclear bombs operate on the principle that energy is required to gather many protons and neutrons into a single nucleus.
It’s like rolling a heavy cart uphill. When you split the nucleus again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and these nuclei have a tendency to split apart even without much external influence.
The lunar surface is made of rock and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust's thickness is approximately 70 km on the near side and approximately 100 km on the far side.
The seabed is thin, and it gets thicker beneath highlands.
Because the crust is thin, there tends to be more ocean on the near side. Magma rose to the surface easily.
Content theory centers around discovering what tickles people's fancy or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people internalize certain needs and desires as they mature into adulthood.
These theories explore the motivations behind why certain people habitually desire to do specific things, and the environmental factors that cause them to do, or refrain from doing, those things.
The two commonly accepted content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a manager finds themselves leading former peers, two types of behavior may emerge: one is an attempt to remain “just one of the guys.”
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, as well as with disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and determining accountability.
The opposite of that is a change into an unrecognizable individual by those who felt they had to change everything the team had built with their own hands.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This kind of action often causes a rift to form between the leader and the remaining members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their respective physical groups.
Virtual teams may hold meetings to accommodate time zones, but this can be difficult for local management to understand, so members often have a higher degree of autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of virtual teams.
"The 'invisible team' refers to the management team who are the superiors of each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would organizations go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One purpose of practicing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized across an organization’s functional divisions, creativity and innovation can emerge.
As a result, the process of organizations collaborating to overcome challenges can lead to new, innovative processes for meeting customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must foster not only knowledge sharing and organizational learning, but also create a culture of innovation.
Angel described the continuum approach in 2006 as a way to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the study of cognition, thereby narrowing the research field and enabling more precise studies.
The correlation between neuropathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
Thanks to the emergence of new technologies, we are now able to observe and investigate brain structures and processes that were previously unclear.
This has allowed us to obtain a wealth of information and materials that will be helpful in constructing simulation models for understanding human mental processes.
While AI has strong science fiction connotations, it forms a very important field in computer science, dealing with the mechanization of behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves building machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
For example, these include functions such as control, planning, scheduling, diagnosing customers and answering their questions, as well as recognizing handwritten characters, voice, and faces.
Those things have become a separate field focused on solving real-life problems.
Currently, AI systems are being integrated into household computers and video game software, while also being frequently used in the fields of economics, healthcare, engineering, and the military.
Most of the class is field work. The teacher frequently tries to take students to places they wouldn't be able to go on a bus trip.
The technology offers a learning method through virtual field trips, allowing students to view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, and appreciate beautiful art—all without leaving the classroom.
Furthermore, virtually sharing the field trip is a wonderful way to reflect on the trip and share experiences in future lessons.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and while the website is updated annually, previous versions are preserved online as a scrapbook for viewing.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Students just starting to blog tend to be sloppy with grammar and spelling, but having readers creates a change in that.
Because students are often the most critical readers, blog writers begin to make efforts to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, writing a blog allows students to become more familiar with the world around them. The necessity of attracting an audience fosters the development of students into more knowledgeable and interesting individuals (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools that encourage students to collaborate and expand the scope of learning beyond the confines of traditional classroom instruction.
By appropriately utilizing blogs, “students’ analytical and critical thinking skills improve. By actively engaging with internet materials, students can define their own positions within the context written by others and articulate their own perspectives on concrete issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital city of Canada, boasting numerous museums and art galleries that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lie Niagara Falls, while to the north stretches pristine natural beauty including Muskoka.
Thanks to all of this, Ontario stands out and is considered by outsiders to be a truly Canadian province.
Further north, there are vast areas with low population density, and some are uninhabited wilderness regions.
A surprising population comparison for many: the number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of the African continent.
Madagascar is by far the largest island, and as a habitat for wildlife, it is a continent all its own.
Most of the small islands are either independent countries or are associated with France, and some are also famous luxury beach resorts.
Additionally, Arabs brought Islam to this land, and it was widely accepted in Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope, marking the beginning of European influence and colonialism.
It is a region bordered by the Sahel to the north and enclosed by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
For female travelers, it is recommended to state you are married, regardless of your actual marital status.
Wearing a ring (not a particularly expensive one) is effective.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to acts that are considered harassment, and being followed or having one's arm grabbed is not uncommon.
When turning down an invitation from a man, stand your ground firmly and with confidence – regardless of cultural differences, you don't have to give in to pushy advances!
The foundations of modern Casablanca were laid by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, who called it Anfa. Subsequently, the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids utilized this location as a strategic port.
The Portuguese destroyed it, rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, but ultimately abandoned the city after the earthquake of 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan sultan as Dar al-Badiya, and named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established it as a trading post.
Casablanca is one of the most difficult places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, pottery, leather products, and hookahs, but they are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, with most streets, particularly in the town center, being buried.
While Goma is relatively safe, if you are traveling to areas outside of Goma, you need to investigate and understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
This city serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and is also one of the most affordable places in Africa to track mountain gorillas.
You can use "boda-bodas" (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is around 500 Congolese francs for short distances.
The place name "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for an exotic and faraway land, combined with the fact that it was a place difficult to reach.
Timbuktu today is a tourist destination due to its reputation, and while it has an airport, it remains a poor town.
It was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites in 1990 to protect it from the threat of desert sand.
It was a major stop on Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s PBS special, *Wonders of the African World*.
This city has a strong Arabic flavor, more so than an African one, and possesses an atmosphere contrasting with other cities in the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, running along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecosystems, each of which is home to different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa’s main tourist destinations and is considered a highlight of South African National Parks (SAN Parks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, this park has a daily conservation fee and entrance fee.
Purchasing a Wild Card can be advantageous. It grants access to major parks in South Africa or all national parks throughout South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is, as its name suggests, part of Hong Kong’s territory and a popular destination attracting many tourists as a sightseeing highlight.
The Hong Kong skyline, with its rows of buildings, is likened to a glittering bar graph thanks to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, let's leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront.
Urban development in Hong Kong Island is largely concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
Since this place was claimed as territory by British colonial rulers, those seeking evidence of the colonial period would do well to start here.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans mountain range is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
This forest is not just a swamp with mangroves growing in it; it also includes some of the last remaining areas of the vast jungle that once covered the Hindustan Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², and approximately one-third of that is covered by waterways/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and is currently estimated to be home to around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer.
Buses depart from the regional bus station (across the river) all day, but most buses, especially those heading east and to Jacárl/Bumtan, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Since the limited-express buses often get crowded, we recommend purchasing your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese-made Coaster buses, all of which are comfortable and durable minibuses.
For traveling to nearby locations such as Paro (150 Nuertam) and Punakha (200 Nuertam), taking a taxi is convenient.
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. Spanning the Oyapok River, this bridge connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83m tall and 378m long, and the bridge has two lanes with a width of 3.50m.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. It was completed in August 2011 but did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The full opening of the bridge is scheduled for September 2017, and is expected to coincide with the completion of inspections by Brazilian customs.
The Guarani people are the most important indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers while also practicing subsistence agriculture.
In the Chaco region, there lived groups such as the Guaycuru and Payagua peoples, other indigenous peoples who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay was born from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous peoples in the 16th century (a land once known as the "Island Continent of the West Indies").
The Spanish colonial period began and lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and distinctiveness.
Argentina is famous for having the world's best polo teams and players.
This year’s biggest tournament will be held at the Las Canitas Polo Club in December.
Small-scale tournaments and matches can also be viewed here at other times.
Please check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo for the tournament schedule and ticket purchase locations for polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is pegged at parity to the British Pound (GBP).
Currency exchange is available at the island's only bank in Stanley (opposite FIC West).
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and Stanley cards and US dollars are also commonly used.
On remote islands, you can use British and American currency, but credit cards likely won't be accepted. It's best to confirm acceptable payment methods with the owner beforehand.
Since it's virtually impossible to exchange currency for the Falkland Islands after leaving the island, let's exchange it before we depart.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so it experiences summer when the Northern Hemisphere is in winter, and winter when the Northern Hemisphere is in summer.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate zone, and temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F) are common in the summer.
While the temperature rarely drops below freezing, it can feel colder than the thermometer reads due to the relationship between wind and humidity.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons, and rainfall is fairly consistent throughout the year.
Many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, but even so, wild animals are still wild, so you should not feed or startle them.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards (100 meters) away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (25 meters) away from other wildlife!
Even though they may seem docile, bison, moose, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can be aggressive.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they fail to keep a safe distance. As these wild animals are large and potentially dangerous, let's avoid entering their territory.
Also, scents can attract wildlife such as bears, so avoid bringing or cooking food with strong odors, and let's strive to keep our campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This town is located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia is a city that was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port is a famous location where naval forces once faced off in a tense standoff after seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain were denied departure in 1889.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost in this battle.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed at a peaceful assembly held in the town.
Auckland is blessed with two harbors and many beaches. The popular beaches are divided into three areas.
North Shore Beach (North Harbour area) faces the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of it is a sandy beach where you can swim safely, and the shade of the pohutukawa trees provides sun shelter.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, on the Waitemata Harbour in central Auckland.
This is a family-friendly beach that gets occasionally crowded, with various shops lining the shore. It's safe for swimming.
The main local beer is called “Number One,” and while it’s not a particularly elaborate brew, it’s a refreshing beer with a clean, crisp taste. Another local beer is called “Manta.”
French wine is readily available, but since we're on a trip, let's try wines from New Zealand and Australia.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you prefer.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" (with milk) coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," cappuccinos are served with plenty of cream (rather than foam), and tea is served without milk.
Warm chocolate is a drink that meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but very delicious.
Trips to the coral reef are held year-round, and injuries caused by the aforementioned factors on the reef are rare.
Even so, please follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish inhabit the waters north of 1770, near coasts and river mouths, from October to April. They can sometimes be seen outside of this period as well.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don’t live exclusively in the ocean; their primary habitat is the estuarine areas of rivers from Rockhampton northward.
Making a reservation in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing they’ll have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Many travel agencies have contracts with specific hotels, but other accommodations such as campsites can also be booked through travel agencies.
Typically, travel agencies offer breakfast, arrangements for transportation between the airport and hotel, or package deals combining flights and hotels.
You can also hold the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to gather other necessary documents to bring with you for travel (such as visas).
However, for any changes or requests, please contact the travel agency first, rather than the hotel directly.
Depending on the festival, it's common for the majority of music festival attendees to camp on the festival grounds, and most participants consider it an important part of the overall experience.
If you want to experience it firsthand, you need to arrive early and secure a campsite where you can hear the performance well.
Please remember that even after the main stage music ends, there may be sections at the festival that continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals even have designated campsites specifically for families with young children.
If you are traveling across the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin. Cabins most affected by the ship breaking through the ice will experience terrifyingly loud noises.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (please check the conditions).
Casinos are typically designed to encourage guests to spend as much time and money as possible. They often lack windows and clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
Casinos typically offer special dining and entertainment options to keep guests comfortable and encourage them to stay longer.
Depending on the venue, alcoholic beverages are offered. However, intoxication impairs judgment, so any skilled gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
People driving in high-latitude areas or mountain passes need to consider the possibility of snow, ice, and sub-freezing temperatures.
Snowy or icy roads have low friction, and you cannot drive as you would on a dry asphalt road.
When a blizzard hits, enough snow can fall in a very short time to cause significant delays.
Additionally, it may snow or be blizzard-like, and the car windows may become covered with condensation or ice, restricting visibility.
Meanwhile, while many countries experience heavy snow and ice as a normal occurrence, transportation continues almost without interruption year-round.
Safari is likely the best tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many tourists.
A safari refers to a land-based journey with the purpose of observing African wildlife, particularly those inhabiting the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, so they can be clearly observed using standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are surprisingly timid, so you often need to use binoculars to get a good look at them.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "walking tour") is a program where you explore the safari zone on foot, lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games are scheduled to be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some competitions will also be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the first and only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, since the 1964 Games.
Those who booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced may find themselves in a troublesome situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies will not be extended beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled.
Event tickets range in price from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with regular tickets expected to cost around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry faster. Many hotels will lend you an iron and ironing board if you ask, even if they aren’t in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you want to dry socks without ironing, you could try using a hairdryer.
Please be careful not to let the dough temperature rise too much (it can cause shrinkage, and in extreme cases, burning).
There are various methods for water purification, and advanced treatment methods are also available that are effective against specific risks that threaten drinking water quality.
Some areas have water that boils in a minute, while others take several minutes to reach a boil.
While there are differences in the effectiveness of filters, if you are concerned, consider purchasing water bottled in sealed containers from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter pests and diseases unfamiliar to their home regions.
Pests can ruin food, sting skin, and in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that kill or injure people by force, typically do not fall under the category of harmful organisms.
Tax-free shopping refers to opportunities to purchase goods exempt from consumption tax and excise tax at specific locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can often save a significant amount of money on items such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is considered the least desirable drive on the main routes connecting Buffalo and Pittsburgh, frequently passing through isolated, undeveloped forested areas.
Those not accustomed to driving on country roads, please be careful of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves, and stay focused.
The posted speed limit is noticeably lower compared to the preceding and following sections, generally ranging from 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and strictly adhering to this limit is considered more important than in other sections.
However, surprisingly, cell phone service is quite good here compared to many other areas (such as Pennsylvania Wilds).
German pastries are very delicious, and in Bavaria, they are similar to those of Austria, its southern neighbor, and come in a wide variety.
Sweet rolls with fruit filling are common, with apples used as an ingredient year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods use nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts. Popular cakes, in particular, pair well with strong coffee.
If you're craving small, rich pastries, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made by stewing meat and vegetables with herbs and spices as a base.
Curry is categorized as either "dry" or "wet" depending on its moisture content.
In North India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry, while coconut milk is often used in South India and the coastal regions of the subcontinent.
Indonesian cuisine, offering choices from the dishes of over 17,000 islands, is a collective term for the incredibly diverse regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualifiers, it refers to cuisine from the central and eastern parts of Java Island.
Javanese cuisine, now widely popular throughout the archipelago, is characterized by its simple seasoning, with peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of spices as the main ingredients.
Stirrups are the parts hung on both sides of the saddle to support the rider's feet.
With this improvement, the ridership will become considerably more stable, but there is still a possibility of riders’ feet getting caught, which raises safety concerns.
The moment you are thrown from a horse, if your foot is caught in the stirrup, there is a risk of being dragged by the horse as it tries to escape. To minimize this danger, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, relatively narrow soles.
Next, some saddles—particularly those made in Britain—are equipped with safety bars; if a rider is about to fall and be pulled backward, the stirrup leathers are designed to detach from the saddle.
Kochamo Valley – often called the Yosemite of South America, this is a premier mountaineering destination in Chile, featuring massive granite walls and numerous rocky outcrops.
From the summit, a breathtaking view unfolds. Mountaineers from around the world continue to establish new routes, surrounded by walls brimming with infinite potential.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving strapping skis or a snowboard to one's feet and gliding down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main activity of the trip, and many enthusiasts, called “ski fanatics,” plan vacations centered around skiing in specific locations.
The concept of skiing is very old, with paintings of skiers found in caves dating back to 5000 BC.
The history of downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpack skiing: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, and ski hiking.
While related to Alpine-style cross-country skiing and mountaineering, it's usually not included in the former, with the latter requiring more robust skis and boots for ascending and descending steep terrain.
Please think of ski routes as being similar to hiking trails.
If conditions are good, we can travel a somewhat longer distance than on foot, but it is very rare to be able to run at a cross-country skiing-like speed on a well-maintained course without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has a large number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries requires repeatedly applying for visas and going through immigration control.
However, the Schengen Area functions as a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this zone, you can generally cross borders without repeatedly going through immigration.
Similarly, once you obtain a Schengen visa, you no longer need to apply for visas for individual Schengen countries, which saves a considerable amount of time, money, and administrative effort.
There is no universal definition of antiques. Depending on the tax office, items over 100 years old are defined as antiques.
This definition allows for geographical variations, and the range of age restrictions may be narrower in North America, for example, than in Europe.
Although handicrafts have a shorter history than mass-produced equivalents, they can also be defined as antiques.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding its trade is also important to many people whose professions lie elsewhere.
However, the Sami people have not traditionally been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather have made a living through activities such as fishing and hunting, so reindeer were mostly kept as working animals.
Today, many Sami people are engaged in modern commerce, and tourism is an important source of income for the Sami region.
The word "gypsy," while widely used particularly among people outside the Roma community, is often considered offensive as it is linked to negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you plan to visit is subject to a travel advisory, it may affect your travel health insurance and travel cancellation insurance.
While you may refer to advice from governments other than your own, such advice is intended for the people of that country.
As an example, Americans living in the Middle East may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendation is simply a summary of the security situation in a certain country.
The presented viewpoints are often superficial and overly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather refers to the collective term for dangerous meteorological phenomena that can lead to physical damage, serious social disruption, and loss of life.
Severe weather can be observed anywhere in the world, and its type varies depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are caused by severe weather phenomena and their effects, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, spouts, and cyclones.
Severe local and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, black ice, and sandstorms.
We strongly recommend that travelers be aware of the risk of adverse weather conditions that could impact their destination, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a conflict zone is required to undergo specialized training.
If you search for "hostile environment courses" online, you will likely find the addresses of local companies.
The course generally covers matters in much greater detail regarding all the issues described here, and usually includes practical exercises as well.
The courses typically last 2-5 days and may involve training in role-playing, first aid, and sometimes even weapon handling.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are not uncommon, but publications covering conflict zones are exceedingly rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid identification documents upon their return home.
Government stances vary regarding issuing passports without gender markings (with an “X” in the gender field) or issuing documents updated to a person’s desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is similarly quite diverse.
Since September 11, 2001, security checkpoint inspections have also become more intrusive.
Thinking pre-operative transgender individuals can pass through scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity is a mistake.
Rip currents are created by the backwash of waves returning to the shore, and often occur near reefs or similar formations.
Due to the underwater topography, returning waves concentrate in a few deep areas, and fast currents heading into the deep sea can sometimes form there.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, but swimming against the current is likely impossible.
If you can break away from the current, swimming back isn't that difficult.
Perhaps you should try to aim for a place where you won't get caught in the waves again, but if you're aware that you lack confidence in your swimming ability, it might be better to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock can come on sooner, last longer, and be more severe than (the lack of time for a honeymoon) culture shock.
Even travelers who easily adapt to new cultures can struggle to become familiar with the unique culture of a specific locality.
Having lived abroad and then returning home, it's inevitable that you've lost some of the habits of your native culture as you’ve adapted to a new one.
If it’s your first trip abroad, people around you will likely be patient and understanding, knowing that they need to get used to travelers.
People may not expect that travelers will require patience and understanding even upon their return home.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is a particularly enjoyable event for children at this tourist destination.
In the darkness, a pyramid appears, and before the show begins, you can tour the pyramid in silence.
Normally, you can always hear the sounds made by tourists and workers here. The story woven from sounds and lights is like something out of a picture book.
The Sphinx is both the backdrop for and a storyteller within a long narrative.
Under the night sky, images are projected onto the pyramids, and the pyramids are lit up one after another.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with 16 actively operating in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Besides Livingston Island and Deception Island, there are also magnificent natural harbors formed by the flooded calderas of still-active volcanoes.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern region of the Antarctic Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula coalesced to form a plateau, then merged again to create the 360 km-long Ellsworth Mountains, which were bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern Sentinel Range of Antarctica lies the Vinson Massif, the highest peak on the continent, with Mount Vinson towering at an altitude of 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where cell phone service is unavailable, satellite phones can be the only option.
Satellite phones generally aren't a replacement for cell phones, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a call.
This service is frequently used by vessels such as entertainment boats, as well as expedition teams that require data or audio in remote locations.
Your local phone company should be able to provide you with detailed information on how to connect to this service.
Among students planning a gap year, the option of traveling and learning is becoming increasingly popular.
It is particularly popular with graduating students who are unsure of their future plans, and utilizing it allows a one-year gap year before university without blemishing your academic record.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can make it easier to actually go on to university after returning home.
Normally, there is a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a perfect country for boating. Known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," Finland has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in archipelagos or lakes.
The coastal archipelago and the largest lake are certainly large enough to enjoy yachting, but small boats and kayaks offer a different kind of experience as well.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime, with approximately one boat for every 7 to 8 people.
This is roughly equivalent to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but very rare in other countries (for example, 1 to 40 people in the Netherlands).
Most Baltic Sea cruises feature a long stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
In other words, you can spend 2-3 days touring historical cities while sleeping and living on the boat at night.
If you are only engaging in cruise tourism and not disembarking, you do not need to obtain a separate visa (as of 2009).
Depending on the cruise, the brochure may include Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is inland and city tours are separate from the cruise fare.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially for those who have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
That’s not something to be ashamed of; it’s no different from the personal fears and aversions that a great many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and their behavior in flight can help overcome fear of the unknown or things beyond one's control.
Delivery services are earning high compensation for urgent deliveries. Often, it's important for business documents, goods, or replacement parts needed for emergency repairs to arrive quickly.
On some routes, large corporations own their own aircraft, but there were issues on other routes and with smaller companies.
When sending luggage by air cargo, it could sometimes take days for it to be unloaded and clear customs due to the air routes.
To get it through quickly, the only option was to send it as checked baggage. According to the airline's regulations, baggage cannot be sent if there is no passenger, so what happens next is crucial.
Naturally, flying first or business class requires paying a higher fare commensurate with the benefits—if it’s for business, try negotiating with your company.
However, it is by no means inexpensive. As a rough estimate, business class is four times and first class is eleven times the price of a typical economy class ticket.
Generally speaking, it's not worth looking for discounts on business or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines charge those fares because they understand there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably to their destination.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic country and has been plagued by ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led to the establishment of the Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova in 1994, a republic which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties are being re-established between these two regions of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, facing the Aegean Sea, is Turkey's third-largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It boasts the country's second-largest port, after Istanbul, and serves as a major transportation hub.
Once a ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling commercial center, modernly developed and surrounded by mountains, centering around a vast bay.
Wide avenues, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled buildings, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, synagogues, and more, giving it a Mediterranean European atmosphere rather than a traditionally Turkish one.
From the village of Haraldarsik, the nearby Esturoi Island is visible, and the village has a rare octagonal church.
In the church cemetery, interesting marble dove sculptures adorn some of the graves.
It's worth taking about 30 minutes to stroll around a village that piques your interest.
In the north lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners thanks to Lord Byron’s passionate praise of its beauty.
Scotturb bus 403 to Sintra runs regularly and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also, if you go north, let's visit the Sanctuary of Fátima, a world-famous holy site with statues of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that what I visited was essentially a massive collective grave, a cemetery with immeasurable significance for the vast majority of the world’s population.
Here, there are many men and women who survived that time, and a large number of people who had loved ones killed or forced into labor there, regardless of whether they were Jewish or not.
Please show respect appropriate to the occasion and conduct yourself with dignity and politeness. Joking about the Holocaust or the Nazis is absolutely unacceptable.
Let's refrain from defacing scenic spots with graffiti using paint or sharp objects.
Barcelona has two official languages: Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, as Catalan is legally established as the first official language, most signs are displayed in Catalan only.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other areas.
Although regular announcements on the metro platforms and inside the trains are only in Catalan, in cases of delays due to accidents, announcements are made in various languages – Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese – through an automated system.
Parisians are often said to be self-centered, arrogant, and rude.
This is just an inaccurate stereotype, but the best way to get by in Paris is to act like a "well-bred" person and practice good manners – then you’ll be able to have a comfortable time.
Though they may seem unapproachable at first, Parisians will likely change their attitude if you demonstrate basic etiquette.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is a World Heritage site overflowing with stunning scenery, featuring 16 lakes of various sizes scattered throughout a vast forest where alpine and Mediterranean vegetation intermingle (primarily beech, spruce, and fir).
Due to the diverse microclimates, the range of soil types and altitudes is extremely wide, resulting in a remarkably rich variety of plant communities.
Also, this region is home to a wide variety of animals and birds.
Rare species such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and capercaillie can be observed, along with a greater number of common species coexisting.
When visiting the monastery, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide coverings for women who arrive unprepared, but bringing your own, especially in a particularly bright color, will likely earn you a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can borrow these at the reception desk by the entrance, but considering they aren’t washed after each use, some people might hesitate to wear them. They are one size fits all for men.
Mallorca's cuisine, like other regions of the Mediterranean, primarily uses bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) as ingredients, and makes generous use of olive oil.
Especially during the summer, a simple dish called “panboli”—bread spread with olive oil and topped with tomatoes, cheese, tuna, and other seasonings—is popular.
All nouns begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence, just like the word "you" in German (Sie).
This is an important method for distinguishing between certain verbs and their objects.
It's somewhat complex for the writer, as it's necessary to investigate whether verbs and adjectives are being used in a nominalized form, but it will certainly be easier for the reader.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, and most words are pronounced literally as they are written.
The pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel, so the main letters to pay attention to are 'c' and 'g'.
Also, “caro” means “beloved,” while “carro” means “tank,” so it’s important to pay attention to the distinction between the single 'r' and double 'rr' pronunciation.
Persian is relatively easy to learn, and mostly follows regular grammar.
Therefore, reading the introductory section of this grammar book will make it easier to learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand its expressions.
It goes without saying, but if you know one of the Romance languages, you should find Portuguese relatively easy to learn.
However, someone with even a little knowledge of Spanish might hastily conclude that "Portuguese is a language so close that it doesn't even need to be studied separately."
Observatories from the pre-modern period are now largely obsolete and decommissioned, remaining as museums or educational facilities.
The pollution that caused the most damage in the past differed in the types of problems it presented compared to today, and because it occurred in urban areas and schoolyards, it felt much closer to people’s lives than current issues.
Many state-of-the-art research telescopes are located in remote, large facilities to enable observations under good atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as *hanami*, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
That concept comes from China, where plum blossoms are favored.
The first hanami (cherry blossom viewing) held in Japan was hosted by the Emperor himself, exclusively for him and the nobles residing near the Imperial Court.
Since plants look their best in their natural environment, resist the temptation to take even “just one” as a specimen.
If you attempt to collect specimens when visiting a well-maintained garden, you will be immediately and without excuse expelled.
Singapore is generally extremely safe, very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything after arriving.
However, as it is located in the “high-latitude tropics” just a few degrees north of the equator, it’s necessary to cope with both consistent heat and (rarely, but during clear weather) strong sunshine.
There are also several buses heading north towards Hebron, which is said to be the legendary burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Please confirm that the bus you are about to board is not only headed towards the Jewish settlements near Kiryat Arba, but also going to Hebron.
A walk along inland waterways could be an interesting theme for spending a holiday.
For example, you could visit the castles of the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley, take a Danube River cruise to charming towns, or enjoy a boat ride on the Erie Canal.
We have also determined routes for popular hiking and cycling courses.
Christmas is the birthday of Jesus and is celebrated as one of the most important holidays in Christianity.
Various traditions associated with holidays are embraced not only by believers living in Christian countries, but also by non-Christians around the world.
There's a traditional custom of spending the night in a place with a good view to watch the sunrise on Easter.
Regarding this tradition, while there is of course a theological explanation within Christianity, it may originate from spring and fertility rituals observed before the Common Era.
In more traditional churches, it is common to hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with a custom of beginning celebrations for the resurrection of Christ simultaneously with midnight.
The animals that first came to the Galapagos Islands all arrived by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to its isolation from the mainland, mammals were unable to travel there, and the giant tortoise became the primary herbivore of the Galapagos Islands.
Since people first set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs have been brought there.
When you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you can experience the "polar night," when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This phenomenon causes the sky to be dark for almost 24 hours, making it a good opportunity to view the aurora.
This area has a sparse population and very little light pollution, allowing you to enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal compared to what people in Europe and the United States are accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues generally address each other by surname and title.
Harmony in the workplace is very important, and to achieve this, we emphasize group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain approval from their superiors for anything they do, and are expected to follow their instructions without question.
