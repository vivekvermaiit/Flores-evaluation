This not only confirms a widely circulated theory – that at least some dinosaurs had feathers – but also provides details that most fossils cannot, such as color and the way they were structured in three dimensions.
Scientists say this animal’s feather outer layer is chestnut brown, while the inner layer is off-white or carrot-colored.
This discovery also provides in-depth insights into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked well-developed rachises – the central shafts of feathers – but did possess other feather characteristics, namely barbs and barbules, researchers infer that these other characteristics likely evolved into rachises later on.
The structure of these feathers indicates they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers noted that even if this is from a young dinosaur’s tail, the sample shows mature feathers rather than downy fluff.
Researchers believe that, despite being a tail from a young dinosaur, the feathers in the sample were fully developed, rather than the down of a juvenile animal.
The car bomb that detonated yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, resulted in the deaths of two police officers and injuries to over twenty civilians.

Currently, the research done has been mostly theoretical, but the purpose of this project is to simulate observations of the Pegasus galaxy.
The effect the team wants to observe is a result of the tidal influence caused by the interaction between the dark matter of this galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the moon's gravity causes tides on Earth, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
Scientists can determine that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
The theory posits that dark matter surrounding a galaxy largely forms a halo, and is composed of numerous particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are alone in a booth, placing a pre-printed ballot indicating their choice into an envelope.
After official personnel confirm the voter’s identity, the voter places the ballot envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting slip.
The French electoral law meticulously codifies the voting procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that the boxes are empty at the start of voting, and that only ballots cast by authorized and verified voters are deposited—no other ballots are added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the ballots following specific procedures under strict supervision.

Her other competition was the giant slalom, where she finished 10th in the women's sitting class with a combined time of 4 minutes 41.30 seconds, 2 minutes 11.60 seconds behind Austria’s Claudia Loesch who finished 1st, and 1 minute 09.02 seconds behind Hungary’s Gyöngyi Dani who finished 9th.
In the women's slalom, four skiers did not finish the race, and out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom, 45 did not receive a ranking.
Central police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Superintendent D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five suspects in connection with the rape of the Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are named Baba Kongar, Bhusa Kongar, Lumpro Kongar, Ghaza Kongar, and Vishnu Kongar.
Officer Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendant appeared in court wearing a mask.
Although three people were inside the house when the vehicle crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The section of road where the crash occurred is temporarily closed as emergency responders rescue the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is currently in detention awaiting arraignment and trial, but due to the widespread dissemination of her image, any witness testimony could be compromised.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, however, the operation of the Scottish justice system is different, with the courts believing that publishing the photos would create potential prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University pointed out: “If journalists publish photos and other information about suspects, they are indeed walking a dangerous line.”
The Lord Advocate, responsible for all prosecution matters, told reporters that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) would make no further comment, at least until any prosecution is brought.
According to leaked documents, the document will mention Palestine’s hope that this border dispute be based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
It is reported that other topics in the document include the future direction of Jerusalem, the shared holy city of the two countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that, if an agreement is signed, it will continue to maintain a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority has agreed to a five-year military presence.
Hunters participating in the supplemental lethal control trials for harmful animals will be closely monitored by national park administrators, as relevant authorities need to monitor and evaluate the performance of this trial.
New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) collaborated with Shooting NSW to recruit eligible volunteers under the shooting association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Farrell, acting director of the Parks and Heritage Unit of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first cull have received thorough safety and training instruction.
Madrid was sworn in yesterday before a temporary electoral commission (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is the fifth interim election committee in Madrid in four years.
As part of a comprehensive set of measures to advance the country toward a new election, the Presidential Committee last month recommended the resignation of the former provisional electoral committee.
The committee was established in response to large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests stem from the inability to hold elections, some of which were due to be held as early as 2011.
According to reports, there have been approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating malfunctions, resulting in a total of 6 fires and causing minor burns to 4 people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it has been informed of 27 incidents related to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating, with the company claiming these incidents were “not serious.”
The government department responded, saying it was "regrettable" that Apple had delayed the report.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency stated that it has not received reports of damage within the islands.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also indicated no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in the Philippine capital of Manila and held them hostage.
Rolando Mondragón shot tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six people have been confirmed dead.
They first released six hostages, including children and the elderly, similar to the Filipino photographer.
Two photographers later exchanged places with an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Finally, Mandosa was shot and killed.
Likins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical field.
He trained to become an obstetrician and began practicing at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Sir Liggins would use his time after work to research premature birth.
His research shows that administering a certain hormone accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer once said: “Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a double moon night, and was very special, just like herself. A strong woman.”
Well-known wrestler "Golddust" Dustin Runnels commented, “Luna was as strange as I was… perhaps even stranger than me… I loved her, and I will miss her… I hope she’s gone to a better place.”
Among the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic was 8% higher than in 2008.
Incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
In the poll, 34% of people agreed with the view that they hope Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia’s last monarch.
In the two extreme results of the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was originally scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as three swimming relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his symptoms have raised doubts about his physical condition.
He couldn't take medication to suppress the pain because those drugs were prohibited during the Olympics.
Mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
By early February, several people had verified the finding using different hardware and software, and it was officially announced on Tuesday.
Water on Earth may have been brought by comets, and the organic substances within the water could form proteins and supply the necessities for life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially Earth's, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Gu Mo assumed the governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed these rumors as "political babble and ignorance."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system proclaimed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration that allows aircraft to shorten flight paths, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and significantly reducing carbon emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No alternative transportation options are provided; the subway will not stop at Wembley, and there is no available parking or park-and-ride scheme on site.
Due to concerns about transportation difficulties, the competition may be forced to begin without the support of teams' fans in attendance.
A study published in the journal *Science* on Thursday reported that new species of birds are emerging in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Despite past beliefs that the evolution of new species takes a longer time, researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Switzerland have discovered that this new species evolved in just two generations, resulting from the hybridization of the local Darwin’s finch (Geospiza fortes) and an introduced cactus finch (Geospiza fortes).
Gold can be forged into various shapes. It can also be rolled into very thin forms.
Gold can be drawn into fine threads for winding and weaving; it can also be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhere to other metals. Because of its thinness, it is sometimes used in a type of book called “illuminated manuscripts,” to decorate the hand-painted illustrations within.
This is known as the acidity or alkalinity in chemistry. You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of chemicals.
The pH value is determined by the concentration of hydrogen ions in a chemical substance (the H in pH stands for hydrogen).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Combine these two powders, then knead them into a ball using clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, resulting in a strange texture and the formation of a shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
In the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remnants of sewer systems were discovered beneath houses.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of communal bathhouses where men and women bathed together.
When you make a phone call to a friend far away, it’s accomplished through artificial satellites.
The artificial satellite in space received the signal and instantly reflected it back to Earth.
Artificial satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth’s atmosphere sometimes distorts our light and vision.
A massive rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to put satellites or telescopes into space.
Wheels have changed the world in remarkable ways. The greatest contribution of wheels to humanity is providing us with simpler and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, automobiles, and other modes of transportation.
Below them are more numerous medium-sized felines, primarily feeding on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelope, and deer.
Finally, many small cats (occasionally domestic cats) also prey on a large number of small prey animals, including insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to success lies in the concept of niches—that is, each cat should have a unique job to do, so they won't compete with each other.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, living in groups called prides.
A lion pride typically consists of one to three adult male lions, along with up to thirty lionesses and cubs.
Lionesses are typically close relatives to each other, being sisters and daughters from the same family.
The behavior of lion prides is very similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs, and these animals are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large felines), and are also very ruthless towards their prey.
Tigers are all-around athletes, capable of climbing (though not particularly specialized in it), swimming, long-distance leaping, and possessing a pulling strength over five times that of a strong human.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars all belong to the same genus (Panthera). Only these four species of cat are capable of roaring.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the lion’s, a purely vocal bellow, but rather resembles a confused, shouted utterance.
Ocelots enjoy eating small animals, and they hunt monkeys, snakes, and rodents, as well as birds when they can. Their prey is almost always much smaller than their own size.
Scientists believe that jaguarundis rely on their sense of smell to track and locate prey, using scent to find where prey appears.
They have excellent night vision and can move silently at night. Ocelots hunt by blending into their surroundings and then ambushing their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from—for example, by crossing mountains or rivers, or by migrating to a new island, making return difficult—they usually find themselves in a different environment than they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore new arrivals need different qualities or to adapt in order to possess stronger competitiveness than before.
The original population remained completely unchanged, and therefore still requires the same adaptive functions as before.
As time passed, the new arrivals began to adapt to the new environment, and their appearance became increasingly distinct from others.
Ultimately, after thousands, or even millions of years, these two groups will look so different that they will be unrecognizable as the same species.
This process is called speciation, signifying the emergence of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence of evolution and a vital component of it.
Plants produce the oxygen humans inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis, and also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes, and most of the food we eat also comes from plants; without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, and therefore, it feared no creature except other mosasaurs.
Its long lower jaw is covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, coupled with another set on its upper jaw, meaning any creature standing before it has no chance of escape.
Although it’s uncertain, we believe it may have had a forked tongue. It would have eaten turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly even its own kind.
It will also attack anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex wouldn’t be its match.
Although Roman food is largely familiar to us, they did indeed eat some bizarre or rare delicacies, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that poor people and women sat on chairs to eat their meals, while wealthy men preferred to attend banquets together and recline to enjoy their lavish feasts.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods that would later be introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia over the following centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans had never eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, and those temples were considered the gods’ homes.
People prepare offerings to present to the gods, and priests strive to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple features an open temple courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Some temples even have pyramid-shaped special towers built within them, known as pagoda temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary of the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house isn’t quite as important.
Jewish family life is mostly spent outdoors.
Women cook in the courtyard; the shop is merely a counter facing the street. People back then built houses with stones.
The land of Canaan did not have extensive forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and as he sailed further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it that name.
But regardless of his discoveries, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited that area at that time.
Although every country is referred to as "Scandinavian," there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie *National Treasure*, you might believe there’s a treasure map drawn on the back of the *Declaration of Independence*.
However, that wasn't the case. Although there was some handwriting on the back of the document, it wasn't a treasure map.
The text on the back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776," and is written upside down at the bottom.
Although no one knows who wrote this text, it is certain that this massive parchment document (approximately 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was originally stored as a scroll.
Therefore, the inclusion of this passage is very likely just for labeling purposes.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
The area was governed by the French “Vichy” regime. These French people lived in harmony with the Germans in 1940, cooperating with the invaders rather than resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, an operation known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large number of people who live and work together cooperatively (that is, a society).
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis," meaning "relating to citizens." It is connected to "civis" and "civitas" in Latin, which mean "citizen" and "city or city-state" respectively, and this, in a way, also defines the scale of a society.
City-states were the precursors to nations, and civilization and culture refer to the knowledge passed down through numerous generations, the continuous footprints of culture, and its widespread dissemination.
Smaller cultures often vanish without leaving a historical trace, and therefore are not recognized as orthodox civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, these thirteen states first established a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation (with Congress as its sole institution).
The Congress lacked the power to tax, and because there was no national executive or judicial branch, it had to rely on the state authorities – often uncooperative with each other – to enforce laws.
It also has no power to revoke tax laws and tariffs between states.
These regulations require unanimous consent from all states to be amended, yet the states’ attitude towards the central government is quite perfunctory, and their representatives are frequently absent.
Both the Italian and German national football teams are the second most successful teams in the world, and they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians also participate in related international and Olympic events.
Japan boasts nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to Japan consisting of a group/cluster of islands, from a geographical perspective, it is commonly classified as an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island’s name as Formosa, meaning “beautiful island.”
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of Indigenous grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work in the company’s rice and sugarcane fields.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) government took control of western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan by force, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. Japan subsequently began to rule Taiwan, continuing until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: the Intihuatana stone, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the edges of the archaeological site have been reconstructed to help visitors better understand the original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was also the primary film size at the end of the analog film era.
It continues to be produced to this day, but more importantly, the aspect ratio of digital camera image sensors has been inherited from it.
In fact, that 35mm format is a bit confusing, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
This format’s aspect ratio (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS advanced photography system format) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in a composition.
It indicates that the most effective position for the subject of a photograph is at the intersection of the lines created by dividing the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, despite ongoing differences in language and customs, Christianity has kept the countries of Europe closely connected.
Its omnipresence affects everyone, from kings to commoners.
Christianity has a core tenet, namely that wealth must be used to help those who are suffering and poor, and church funds are specifically established for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the center of power for the Church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether the Church truly adheres to this creed.
Shortly after the outbreak of war, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy of cutting off essential military and civilian supplies has indeed been effective, although this method of blockade violates international regulations established and widely accepted by nations through numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
The UK laid naval mines in international waters to prevent any vessels from entering the area, even endangering neutral ships.
Because other countries didn't react much to this tactic, Germany believed their unrestricted submarine warfare would not provoke a strong backlash.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among citizens and toward the nation was one of pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, all nations hoped to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and took a job at Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Bachelor, his former employer.
Ancient China used unique methods to denote different periods; each stage of China or each ruling family belonged to a distinctly different dynasty.
However, times of dynastic change are also periods of local fragmentation and unrest, with the most famous example being the sixty-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles engaged in fierce wars to争夺 the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most brutal eras in ancient Chinese history, with countless lives lost in the struggle to seize the throne within the magnificent imperial palace in Xi'an.
The revolution produced numerous impacts on social and political levels, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than being the sole possession of a monarch.
Moreover, after the revolution, all positions were opened to any proactive male applicants, allowing those with the greatest willingness and achievements to take charge.
The same situation also occurred within the military, as they no longer distinguished rank by position, but rather by ability.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed laboring classes of many other countries to launch revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in transcending worldly affairs. He often went to a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has witnessed the passage of time, revealing a vibrant facet of Muhammadan spirituality.
This cave is located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In reality, even if someone knows of its existence, it’s not easy to find. Once inside the cave, you are completely cut off from the outside world.
Apart from the clear, beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen; only a small part of the world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, and it is one of many large pyramid structures built to commemorate deceased pharaohs.
Located in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, the Giza Plateau, or “Giza Pyramid Complex,” includes several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest pyramid in the world), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the massive Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu’s wives, concubines, and family members.
The “upward arc” mark looks like a V, while the “downward arc” mark looks like a staple or a square open at the bottom.
Up indicates you should push the bow from the tip, down indicates you should pull the bow from the root (where your hand holds the bow).
Up-bow markings generally indicate a softer sound, while down-bow markings generally indicate a stronger and more assertive sound.
Please feel free to make markings with a pencil, but please remember that the bowing markings printed on the page all have musical significance and should not be ignored.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), along with the King’s sister, Princess Elizabeth, were forced by a group of market women to move from the Palace of Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by carriage, but were surrounded by a mob along the way, with the people shouting threats and insults at the King and Queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a rioter even brandished the head of a royal guard before the terrified queen, the guard having been killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenses for the U.S. imperialist conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government, covering most of the government’s expenses, while bond interest floated through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the exorbitant profits long extracted from the exploitation of Filipinos have been a fundamental harvest of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the historical context that led to the organization’s founding.
This period when these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, corresponding to the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, and is traditionally considered to have ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses many practiced concepts, ranging from technology-driven or technology-led change to the more rigid notion that "the logic behind scientific laws and their manifestation in technology drives human destiny."
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the trajectory of technology’s development has a far greater influence than cultural or political factors, and that technology “shapes” existing social forms rather than being constrained by society.
For example, some people say that the automobile inevitably drives road development.
However, building a nationwide highway network for a small number of cars is not economically viable, leading people to develop new manufacturing methods to reduce the cost of car ownership.
As the number of car owners increases, the probability of road accidents also rises, which in turn drives the development of new medical technologies to repair injured limbs.
Cultural determinism was an important component of Romanticism, drawing heavily from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, the geographical environment shapes the individual, and over time gives rise to customs and cultures associated with that environment. These customs and cultures, due to their harmony with local society, are superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is renowned as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was renowned as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its prominence gradually declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned with souvenirs such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than goods sold in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this moment that the title of “city of fashion” shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a unique style. A major development at the time was the use of buttons by members of the Crusades to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming where crop yields are only sufficient to feed the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple farming system, typically employing organic cultivation, preserving and utilizing seeds from crops native to the local ecosystem, and adopting crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and many developing countries still do.
Subcultures allow people with similar interests, and who also feel overlooked by mainstream society, to come together and develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are often distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, geographic location, or gender of their members.
The characteristics that allow subcultures to establish themselves may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or various other factors.
Members of subcultures typically express their affiliation with the group through distinctive and symbolic forms, including dress, behavior, and the use of slang.
A common method used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their upbringing, did not receive the socialization process imparted by adults.
These children are referred to as “feral children.” Some feral children have experienced confinement (often by their parents); in certain cases, children were abandoned because their parents could not accept severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Stray children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Other children were reportedly raised by animals; some were said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If a wild child were raised entirely by non-human animals, they would exhibit behaviors almost identical to those of the animal raising them (assuming physiological conditions allow), such as displaying fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning makes learning easier and more enjoyable, while scaffolded learning takes it to the next level.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support system that can assist individuals as they navigate new learning experiences (such as using new computer programs or starting new projects).
Scaffolding can be either virtual or physical; in other words, both teachers and the Microsoft Office Clippy assistant are forms of scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software, functioning to prompt, hint, and explain procedures that students may find difficult to handle independently.
There are many reasons why children are sent to foster care, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking nurturing, care, and education, but sadly, that is often the reality.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster families should provide them with all the necessities they lacked in their previous homes.
The internet combines the elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
From the perspective of usage and fulfillment, the distinct characteristics of the internet have opened up new realms.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” can both be considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
In their 1998 paper, Eighmey and McCord, while investigating audience reactions to websites, found that “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also new motivational dimensions.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in interpreting microexpressions and facial movements that last only milliseconds.
Especially, some believe that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay “The President’s Speech,” points out that people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand the content of a speech can still accurately perceive the speaker’s sincerity.
He even believes that animals like domestic dogs might possess the ability to explain human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century showed there are two types of gene mutations: recessive and dominant.
Mutation introduces new genetic variations, while natural selection removes them from the dominant variation pool.
In every generation, separation and recombination cause constant changes in both dominant and recessive gene sets.
Primates with digestive systems similar to humans struggle to obtain sufficient amino acids from the plants on the grasslands.
Furthermore, insufficient amino acid intake can lead to severe consequences: poor growth and malnutrition, ultimately resulting in death.
The most readily available plant resources should be the protein obtainable from leaves and pods, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Relatively speaking, insect-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering all factors, if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do on the savanna today, we shouldn’t be surprised.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep within a short timeframe (10-60 minutes later).
By using a relatively quiet alarm clock, allowing you to become conscious but not fully awake, you can easily accomplish this.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm in your sleep, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the physiological cycle include drinking a large amount of liquid before bed (especially water or tea, a recognized diuretic), forcing one to wake up and urinate.
The level of inner peace a person experiences is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their mind and body.
The more relaxed the body and mind, the stronger the vitality one possesses. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of reaching enlightenment. The only obstacles on the path to enlightenment are our own anxiety and negative energy.
Tibetan Buddhism is founded on the teachings of the Buddha, but its flourishing is due to the Mahayana Buddhist path of love, combined with numerous techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is fundamentally quite simple, encompassing Kalachakra yoga, meditation, and devotional practices focused on embracing all beings.
During Kundalini Yoga practice, Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is roused through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra chanting, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan Buddhist meditation is deity yoga. Through visualizing deities, one purifies all energy channels, activates chakras, and cultivates enlightened awareness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, prompting cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, with the war’s end, conflicts in systems, practices, and culture created rifts between these nations.
Barely two years after the end of World War II, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It continued uninterrupted for four decades, and was fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had fallen, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize near the bridgehead in Romania.
However, all these plans were scrapped overnight. More than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army invaded eastern Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, and subsequently entered Belarus and Ukraine, forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using shipping to transport goods is currently the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and cargo across the sea.
Traditionally, the navy’s mission has been to ensure the safe transfer of people and goods for one’s own country, while disrupting the transfer of personnel and cargo by enemy nations.
One of the most noteworthy examples from this period is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy attempted to disrupt shipping (mainly using U-boats).
If the Allied forces were defeated, Germany might conquer Britain just as it conquered other parts of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Goats are typically free-range grazed in hilly or other pasture areas, often cared for by child or adolescent goatherds, similar to more well-known shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
England built horse-drawn railways as early as the 16th century.
Although the four-wheeled freight track consisted only of parallel wooden planks, it allowed horses to haul goods along it, offering a faster transport speed and greater cargo capacity compared to the somewhat rough roads of the time.
They started using sleepers to secure the tracks very early on. But gradually, people discovered that laying steel rails increased the efficiency of the track.
This became a common practice, but iron would cause more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was born.
The earliest form of transportation known to humankind was walking, and with the emergence of *Homo Erectus* (also known as upright man), humans began to walk upright two million years ago.
Their evolutionary ancestors, the southern ancient apes, were not accustomed to walking upright.
Evidence of bipedal locomotion has been found in fossils of *Australopithecus* dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although *Sahelanthropus tchadensis* may have already been walking upright as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, participate in environmental movements, and even become social activists, all to minimize future suffering.
This is often like “treating the headache with medicine for the head, and treating the foot pain with medicine for the foot.” However, if we want more than just temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and thoroughly resolve it.
This world has changed due to the advancement of human science and technology, and problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and wasteful human lifestyles – this is abundantly clear.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the print shop of John Dunlap, several blocks away.
Approximately 150 to 200 copies were printed overnight, now known as the "Dang Liepu single-sided printing version."
The document was first publicly read by Johnny Knison on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and read to his troops in New York by Washington on July 9th. A duplicate arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving single-sheet prints of the Declaration of Independence known to exist are the oldest versions of the document remaining, as the original manuscript has not survived.
Currently, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, which we know as birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't consider them to be a type of dinosaur.
However, birds and dinosaurs still share many similarities.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
In reality, all computers today are fundamentally based on processing information encoded in binary.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These digits are called binary digits, or bits as they are known in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to rely on for a direct diagnosis.
It's best to identify signs of poisoning within the body, which may include discovering containers of opened medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the first aid instructions on the label of that specific poison.
The term "臭蟲" (chòu chóng) is the formal entomological name for these types of insects.
This name originates from ancient understanding of bedbugs—they are highly adapted insects that parasitize on humans.
Both kissing bugs and bed bugs have the characteristic of breeding within nests, allowing them to adapt to life in nests or the homes of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it a leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
Spouses may determine that raising a baby is not in the best interests of themselves or the child.
These couples can choose to plan to adopt their child.
Adoption refers to the termination of parental rights by the biological parents, allowing another couple to raise their child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, a method that also guides the majority of scientific research.
However, the experimental method is not the only one; experiments are tests that can eliminate one or more hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations can also lead scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle’s scientific viewpoints, including those in psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Hellenistic learning, the Western world severed its connection to the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many scholars have observed that physiological and behavioral rhythms often heavily rely on internally generated biological cycles and the substances produced by the body’s internal clock.
Not only periodic rhythms that respond to external cyclical cues are observable in the majority of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The circadian rhythm is a self-sustained oscillator that continues to operate cyclically on its own, even without external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the key experiments demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, also known as viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA in bacteriophages, and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the proteins in the bacteriophages.
The effects of mutations can vary widely depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are inherited by offspring, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Travel itineraries themed around nature will attract those interested in the outdoors, allowing them to enjoy natural scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks to learn about ecosystems and related information.
For example, visiting Borneo to photograph and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, a group of people drive away from the small rural town to their workplaces, passing those coming from the very places where the first group is headed.
In this bustling flow of traffic, everyone is linked to this car-based transportation system in some way and supports its existence.
Today, science indicates that this large-scale carbon-based economic activity has shifted the biosphere away from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social activities and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about issues like water quality and bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system attract so much complaint, and why are there problems every day? Is it due to the incompetence of transportation engineers, or are there more fundamental reasons?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations, as well as the interactions between road users.
The problem is that, because driving habits are impossible to predict with 100% accuracy, studying traffic flow is very difficult.
Fortunately, the driving behavior tends to fall within a reasonable and consistent range, and as a result, traffic flow also exhibits reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To more completely represent traffic flow, we define the relationship between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the earliest animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly allows them to more easily evade predators and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to find more small places to burrow into to avoid predators.
Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies are unable to fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believe he is correct, but many hold the opposite view; they believe that the solar system (and even other stars) revolves around the Earth, including the sun.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in terms of water volume on Earth. Its water discharge is eight times greater than that of the world’s second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching six miles wide.
Of all the river water flowing into the ocean on Earth, a full 20% comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River's mainstream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale of construction and exceptional techniques of the Giza pyramids are unmatched.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were very surprised by the historical relics left by their ancestors, which were already over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people, making it the smallest independent country and the country with the fewest people in the world.
The laws and official documents of the Vatican all use Italian.
Italian is also the language commonly used by the majority of the working population in that country, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these elements exist in nature in their elemental form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things are composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (arranged in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized they would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is composed of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so small that trillions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, pencils quickly became good friends to many people when they were first invented.
Unfortunately, with the rise of new writing methods, the status and usage rate of pencils have gradually declined.
Everyone is now writing messages on computer screens, and pencil sharpeners are no longer needed.
We can only wait and see, curious about where the keyboard will go next when another new invention appears.
The operating principle of a fission bomb is based on the fact that a large amount of energy is required to fuse numerous protons and neutrons into a single atomic nucleus.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Further splitting the atomic nucleus will then release a portion of that energy.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, meaning they are prone to splitting even without, or with very little, external force.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick near the continental margin and approximately 100 kilometers thick further away.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
Perhaps there are more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there, allowing magma to rise to the surface more easily.
The core of content theory is to identify what resonates with or attracts people.
These theories posit that people have certain needs or desires that are internalized as they mature into adults.
These theories explore what makes some people desire certain things, and within their environment, what makes them want to do or not do certain actions.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, when a supervisor begins to lead former peers, two types of behavior can emerge. One is attempting to maintain their position as a member of the original peer group.
These types of managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, enforce disciplinary actions, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold subordinates accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, however, one might transform into a completely different person, believing they must change everything the team has always done and instead do things their own way.
After all, a leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates discord between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams must adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members are typically the points of contact with the physical teams they directly support.
They typically have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may collaborate on meetings across different time zones, a nuance their local management may not fully understand.
Possessing a truly “invisible management team” (taken from Larson and LaFasto’s 1989 work, page 109) is also a unique element in constituting a virtual team.
"The 'Invisible Team' is a management team where each member reports directly to it, and this team sets the standards for every member."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning institution? One of the goals of putting an organization’s learning concept into practice is innovation.
When all functional departments within an organization effectively utilize all available resources, creativity and originality can be unleashed.
Therefore, the process of organizations combining forces to overcome obstacles can drive innovation to meet customer needs.
Before an organization possesses innovative capabilities, leaders should cultivate a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angier (2006) described patterned behavior, a method for helping organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurological and biological data provide concrete evidence for the theoretical approaches of cognitive research, thereby narrowing and refining the scope of study.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior encourages scientists to conduct research.
For a long time, people have always known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The invention of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and operational processes previously unseen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulations, which helps us understand the processes of how our minds work.
Although artificial intelligence possesses strong science fiction connotations, it still constitutes a vitally important branch of computer science, specifically dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
One aspect of artificial intelligence research is creating machines capable of automatically performing tasks that require intelligent behavior to complete.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and problems, and recognition of handwriting, voice, and faces.
These developments evolved into distinct disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are also built into some home computers and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of school education. Often, teachers want to take students to places buses can't reach.
Technology offers virtual field trips as a solution. Students can sit in the classroom to visit museum artifacts, explore aquariums, or appreciate beautiful art.
Sharing the field trip virtually is also a good way to revisit the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year for their annual trip to the state capital, and while the website is updated annually, older versions are retained online as a sort of scrapbook.
Blogs also help to improve students’ writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this generally changes due to the presence of an audience.
Because students are typically the most discerning readers, bloggers will begin to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Writing blogs also “forces students to gain a deeper understanding of the world around them.” To satisfy audience interest, it encourages students to become more intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school environment.
Proper use of blogs can enhance students’ analytical and critical thinking skills; students can actively engage with online materials to clearly define their position within the context of others’ writing, and also articulate their own viewpoints on specific issues (Olavis, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, with a beautiful and pleasant environment, and uses both English and French. It boasts numerous art galleries and museums, showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while to the north are Muskoka and other areas, where the natural beauty remains largely undeveloped.
All of the above and many other factors contribute to Ontario being seen by outsiders as the quintessential image of Canada.
Further north, vast areas are sparsely populated, with some being virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising demographic comparison: the number of African Americans residing within the United States exceeds the total population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is one of the largest islands, rich in wildlife and plants, making the island itself a continent unto itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or have ties with France, and are known for their luxurious beachfront resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and Islam greatly developed in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
It borders the Sahel region to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
For female travelers, it is recommended to claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring might also be helpful (but don’t wear one that looks too expensive).
Female friends should also understand that cultural differences can lead to situations they might consider harassment, such as being followed or having one's arm grabbed, which are not uncommon.
When rejecting men, you should be firm and not be afraid to stand your ground (this is wrong, regardless of cultural differences!).
Casablanca’s modern city was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese flattened and rebuilt the city, naming it “Casa Branca” (White House), but abandoned the place again after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it “Dar al-Badiya.” However, “Casablanca” was the name given to it by Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
In the old city area of Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, including tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and all sorts of fancy trinkets, but these are mostly aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, with most of the city's streets, particularly in the city center, being buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, if you plan to travel outside of Goma, you must do your research and understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and offers some of the most affordable gorilla trekking experiences in Africa.
You can explore Goma by Boda-boda (motorcycle taxi), with short trips generally costing around 500 Congolese francs (locally).
Because it was relatively difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" gradually became a symbol of a distant and exotic land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its past reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was listed as a World Heritage Site in Danger due to the threat of desert dust.
This was one of the key locations featured in Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s PBS special, *Wonder of the African World*.
That city differs noticeably from others in the country, leaning towards an Arabic rather than an African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and delineated by the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,000 square kilometers and is divided into fourteen ecological zones, inhabited by diverse wild flora and fauna.
It is one of South Africa’s main attractions and is also considered the flagship park of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, this park has daily conservation fees and entrance fees.
Perhaps purchasing a Wild Card bundle ticket would be more cost-effective; this type of ticket allows you access to select parks in South Africa, or all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name “Hong Kong Special Administrative Region” and is also a popular tourist destination.
Some say the entire row of buildings that form Hong Kong’s skyline, set against the waters of Victoria Harbour, resembles a shimmering bar graph.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, you can leave Hong Kong Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across the harbor.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the newly reclaimed land along the northern coast.
The British colonizers seized this place for themselves, so if you want to find evidence of colonial history on this land, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast to the borders of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans forest has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area located within India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
This forest is not only mangrove swamps, but also contains a portion of the vast forests that once covered the Ganges Plain, of which very little remains today.
The Sundarbans forest covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, about one-third of which is water or swampland.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and currently the area is estimated to have 400 Bengal tigers, as well as approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses run all day from the interval bus station (on the other side of the river), but most depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those going to the East and Jarkhar/Bumthang.
Due to frequent full capacity on the express bus, it is recommended that you purchase your ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are accessible by comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster buses.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters and a length of 378 meters, with each of the two lanes being 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn’t open to traffic until March 2017.
This bridge is planned to be fully open to traffic in September 2017 – coinciding with the expected completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoint.
The Guarani people are the most important indigenous group residing in present-day eastern Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic lifestyle while also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to indigenous tribes such as the Guarani and Paiagua, who traditionally sustain themselves through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay (previously known as the “Giant Province of the Indians”) was born from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonial period lasting three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has striven to preserve many of its local characteristics and appearances.
Argentina is renowned for having world-class polo teams and players.
The biggest event of the year will be held at the Las Cañitas Polo Club in December.
Other, smaller tournaments or competitions are also held at other times of the year.
For information regarding the event and to purchase polo match tickets, please contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is valued at par with the pound sterling (GBP).
The only bank on the islands is located in Stanley, opposite the “Falkland Islands Company (FIC) West Store,” and is the sole place to exchange currency.
On the islands, British pounds are generally accepted, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted within Stanley.
Remote islands may accept US or British currency, but credit cards likely won’t be accepted; please inquire with merchants in advance to confirm which payment methods are available.
It is almost impossible to exchange its currency outside the Falkland Islands, so be sure to complete the exchange before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it experiences summer when the Northern Hemisphere is in winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region, and temperatures frequently exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer.
The winter chill there can be deceptive, as the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel much colder than what the thermometer shows.
There isn't a distinct rainy season or dry season; rainfall is roughly evenly distributed throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild creatures, and therefore should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities advise maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, moose, elk, bears, and nearly all large animals are potentially aggressive.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they fail to keep a safe distance. These animals are large, untamed, and potentially dangerous, so please give them enough space.
In addition, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so please avoid bringing or cooking strongly scented foods, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This town is located on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000 people.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, this port was the site of a notorious naval standoff, when seven warships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain all refused to leave the harbor.
All ships except one British vessel sank, resulting in the deaths of nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed at a peaceful assembly in the town.
Auckland spans two harbors, and therefore has many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in 3 areas.
North Shore Beach (Beigang District) is located along the Pacific coast, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Those beaches are almost all safe for swimming, and most of them offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitematā Harbour, between Auckland Central's Mission Bay and the upscale suburb of St Heliers.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with rows of shops lining the shore. It is safe to swim here.
The main local beer is "First," and it's not a beer with a complex flavor, but rather one that is smooth and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
Although there are many French wines available, New Zealand and Australian wines may hold up better to long-distance shipping.
The local tap water is very safe and drinkable, but if you're not comfortable with it, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, “white coffee” is a foreign concept. Espresso is “espresso,” cappuccino is coffee topped with a generous amount of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The juice is expensive, but very delicious.
Many people visit the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and few are injured while doing so.
Visitors are still advised to heed the advice of the authorities, observe all signage, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, box jellyfish appear near the beaches and river mouths north of 1770. Outside of these months, they are occasionally sighted.
Sharks do indeed exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not very active in the ocean, and their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give travelers peace of mind, knowing they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies usually partner with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation through them, such as campsites.
Tour packages offered by travel agencies typically include breakfast and round-trip airport transfers, and may even offer combinations of flights and hotels.
If you need time to consider the proposal or gather additional documents for your destination (such as a visa), they can also hold the reservation for you.
However, if you encounter any issues needing improvement or have any requests, you should first contact the travel agency, rather than contacting the hotel directly.
During certain festivals, most visitors attending music festivals choose to camp on-site, and they largely consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to enjoy the event up close, you must go in early and find a camping spot near the music performance.
Please remember that even after the main stage music performance ends, performances in other areas of the music festival may continue late into the night.
For families with young children, some festival venues will arrange dedicated camping areas.
If traveling across the Baltic Sea in winter, please confirm the location of your cabin, as the passage of ice floes can create extremely frightening noises in the most affected cabins.
The St. Petersburg cruise itinerary includes city sightseeing. Passengers on board do not need to hold a visa (check relevant regulations).
Casinos typically make many efforts to keep guests staying longer and spending more money; there are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They typically offer special meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and encourage them to stay.
Some establishments offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, being intoxicated impairs judgment, and good gamblers are well aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high-altitude areas or on mountain roads should consider the likelihood of encountering snowfall, icy conditions, or temperatures at or below freezing.
On icy and snowy road surfaces, traction is low, and you cannot drive as you would on normal asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to immobilize you.
Snow, blowing snow, condensation, or ice forming on windows can all reduce visibility.
On the other hand, in many countries, icy and snowy weather is very common, and traffic is rarely disrupted throughout the year.
Safari tours are arguably the most attractive tourism element in Africa, and are a highlight of many visitors’ journeys.
The term "safari" generally refers to a journey—typically overland—to observe the magnificent wildlife of Africa, especially the animals of the savanna.
Animals like elephants and giraffes often approach vehicles, so standard equipment allows you to see them more clearly.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs are sometimes afraid of people approaching, so binoculars are more suitable for observing them.
Wilderness trekking (also known as forest bathing, wild hiking, or long-distance walking) involves mountain climbing, with trip durations ranging from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with several events taking place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, with the previous occasion being in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the postponement was announced, you may be facing a somewhat tricky situation.
Cancellation policies varied among different entities, but most policies implemented due to the coronavirus did not extend beyond the end of March, and certainly not to July 2020, the originally scheduled date for the Olympics.
Most event tickets are expected to range from 2,500 to 130,000 Japanese yen, with general admission tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels can lend you an iron and ironing board even if they aren't provided in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer to dry them, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it may cause shrinkage, and could even scorch in extreme cases).
Among the many ways to purify water, some are more effective at addressing specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it requires several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, consider purchasing sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Visitors may encounter animal pests that are uncommon in their hometowns.
Pests can damage food, cause discomfort, and, in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infectious diseases.
Contagious diseases themselves, or animals that pose a danger of harming or killing people, are generally not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from sales tax and consumption tax in certain regions.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on items like tobacco and alcohol.
The stretch of road between Bornemarien and Fairmont, passing through many remote and desolate areas, is considered the most challenging section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway.
If you are not accustomed to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp curves make up the vast majority.
The speed limit posted here is noticeably lower than on the preceding and following sections of road, typically 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 kilometers per hour), and strictly adhering to these limits is even more important than on other roads.
However, it’s curious that the mobile service here is much stronger than in other sections along the way, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very delicious, while those from Bavaria are rich and diverse, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples frequently made into pastries year-round, while cherries and plums appear on the table during the summer.
Many German baked goods commonly contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cake varieties are particularly well-suited to be paired with a strong cup of coffee.
If you're looking for a small and filling snack, you could try a deep-fried jam-filled pastry, which goes by different names depending on the region: Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with the addition of meat or vegetables.
Curries are categorized as “dry” or “wet” depending on their liquid content.
Yogurt is commonly used in curries from Pakistan and the inland regions of North India, while coconut milk is often substituted in South India and other coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent.
Indonesian cuisine is a collective term for foods composed of over 17,000 islands, encompassing the country’s vast and diverse regional dishes.
However, when used without other qualifiers, this term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now enjoyed throughout Indonesia, primarily features dishes with simple seasonings, most commonly using peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (particularly Javanese palm sugar), and a variety of fragrant spices.
Stirrups are used to support the rider's feet on either side of the saddle.
They can provide more stability for the rider, but the rider’s feet may get stuck, thus raising safety concerns.
If a rider falls from a horse but their foot remains caught in the stirrup, they risk being dragged as the horse runs away. Many safety precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
First, most knights wore boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Again, some saddles (especially English saddles) have safety handles; when a rider falls off, pulling back on them can cause the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley – Chile’s premier climbing destination, often called the “Yosemite of South America,” boasts vast expanses of granite walls and cliffs of all kinds.
The mountaintop offers breathtaking views. Rock climbers from around the world continue to pioneer new routes on the immensely promising cliffs.
Skiing, including alpine skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport where skiers or snowboarders attach skis or a snowboard to their feet and glide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a popular travel event loved by many, and these people are sometimes called ski enthusiasts; they plan their entire vacation around skiing and stay in specific locations.
The concept of skiing has existed for a long time, with depictions of skiers found in cave paintings as early as 5000 BC.
The sport of alpine skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring is also known as backcountry skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski trekking.
This activity is similar to Alpine skiing, but generally does not involve high-alpine skiing and ski mountaineering, both of which are performed on steep terrain and require more robust skis and boots.
Think of a ski run as a similar hiking trail.
When conditions are good, the distance you can travel with weighted sledding on snow will be slightly longer than with hiking, but you rarely achieve the speed of ski-mountaineering on a clear snow track.
Although the European continent is relatively small, it comprises many independent countries. Generally, traveling between several countries means needing to apply for multiple visas and undergo numerous passport checks.
However, in this regard, the operation of the Schengen Area is like that of a single country.
As long as you remain in this area, generally speaking, you can cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state separately, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn’t a universally accepted definition of which man-made items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
Different geographical areas have different definitions; in places like North America, the time restrictions may be shorter than in Europe.
Although handicrafts may exist for a shorter time than other mass-produced items of the same type, they can still be recognized as antiques.
For the Sámi people, reindeer herding is an important livelihood, and for the many Sámi with other specializations, the surrounding culture of reindeer husbandry is also very important.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami people engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; rather, they lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and viewed reindeer as beasts of burden for hauling and carrying loads.
Currently, many Sami people are involved in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami region.
Despite the widespread use of the term "Gypsy," particularly among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive due to the negative stereotypes and misconceptions associated with the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
Besides researching yourself, you might also want to consult the government’s opinion, however, their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face circumstances different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations offer merely a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Compared to the detailed information available elsewhere, their perspectives are often coarser, vaguer, and overly simplistic.
Severe weather is a general term for all dangerous weather phenomena, which has the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and comes in various types, depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rain or heavy snow, and wildfires are manifestations and results of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Strongly advise travelers to pay attention to whether severe weather may affect their travel destinations, as severe weather can impact travel plans.
If anyone plans to travel to countries considered war zones, they should receive professional training.
Searching for "hostile environment awareness training" online should be able to find the addresses of local companies.
The course will typically explain all the issues discussed here in a more detailed manner, often supplemented with practical experience.
The courses typically last from 2 to 5 days and involve role-playing, extensive first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad must carry valid return travel documents.
Governments around the world may not be willing to issue passports without a designated gender (X), or to update documents for individuals who desire a specific name and gender.
The degree to which governments around the world are willing to recognize these documents varies significantly.
After September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints became more stringent.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are waves that break on the beach and then turn back, typically occurring near reefs or similar areas.
According to underwater topography, returning waves will concentrate in a few deeper areas and may generate rapid currents flowing towards the deep water there.
Most fatalities are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the current to return, an attempt with a very low chance of success.
Once you break away from the current, swimming back to shore isn't any harder than usual.
Try to swim towards a place where you won’t be trapped again, or, depending on your swimming ability and whether anyone has noticed you, you can wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock appears faster (with less of a honeymoon period), lasts longer, and is more severe than regular culture shock.
For tourists who easily adapt to new cultures, it can sometimes be particularly difficult to readjust and reintegrate into their own native culture.
After living abroad for a period of time and returning home, you have adapted to the new culture, and have forgotten some habits ingrained in you by the domestic culture.
When you first arrive in a foreign country, people know that newcomers need time to adjust, and will generally treat you with patience and understanding.
But for returning hometown travelers, people may feel no need to be patient with or understanding of them anymore.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the night, and quietly admire them before the performance begins.
You can usually always hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The interplay of sights and sounds is like a storybook.
The performance used the Sphinx as a backdrop, and had it narrate a long story.
The imagery was projected onto one pyramid, while lights illuminated the others.
Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, as their territory, and the islands host the most bases – sixteen were operational in 2020.
This archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the human settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, the latter being a spectacular natural harbor formed by the flooded caldera of an active volcano.
Ellsworth is located on the southern part of the peninsula, bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountain ranges on the peninsula converge here to form a highland, then reappear as the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which were split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
Vinson Massif, the highest mountain in Antarctica, has an elevation of 4,892 meters and is located in northern Antarctica, also known as the Sentinel Range.
In remote areas where cell phone signals are unavailable, you may only be able to use a satellite phone.
Generally speaking, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones, as you must be outdoors and aligned with a satellite to make a call.
Vessels – including pleasure craft and expedition ships requiring remote data and audio – frequently use this service.
Your local telecommunications provider should be able to provide more information on connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, traveling and studying are increasingly popular choices.
This is particularly popular with recent graduates, allowing them a year off before university graduation without sacrificing their studies.
Often, participating in gap year programs abroad can actually increase your chances of being accepted into higher education when you return home.
Generally speaking, tuition fees must be paid to participate in these teaching programs.
Finland is a very suitable place for boating. Known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," Finland also boasts thousands of lake islands or coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats, even kayaks, can offer a different kind of experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with roughly one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand align with this, but it appears quite unusual in other regions (for example, the ratio in the Netherlands is 1 in 40).
Most Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
In other words, you could spend several full days exploring this historic city, returning to the ship for the night.
If you are joining a cruise tour and going ashore, you do not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise itinerary brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As shown on the map above, Berlin is not located by the sea, therefore the cost of visiting this city is not included in the cruise fare.
Regardless of age or background, air travel can be a frightening experience, especially for those who have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
This isn’t something to be ashamed of: it’s no different from many people fearing or disliking certain things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help them overcome fears based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies rapidly deliver goods, thereby earning substantial compensation. Time is often critical when transporting business documents, merchandise, or urgent repair parts.
Larger companies have their own planes on some routes, but it can be more troublesome for other routes or smaller companies.
If they ship items by air freight, it may take several days to complete unloading and customs clearance on certain routes.
The only way to get it delivered faster is to send the goods as checked baggage. Airlines prohibit the check-in of baggage without a passenger, and this is where your opportunity lies.
The most straightforward way to get a first or business class ticket is to pull out a thick wad of cash and enjoy the perks (though an even better way is to have your company pay for it).
However, it’s not cheap: a rough calculation shows you’ll likely need to spend four times the economy class fare for a business class ticket, and eleven times the fare for first class!
Generally speaking, trying to find deals on business or first-class seats for direct flights from location A to location B is usually futile.
Airlines are keenly aware that there is a core customer base in the market willing to pay high prices for fast and comfortable travel to their destinations.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered greatly from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the emergence of a state in eastern Moldova calling itself the Transnistrian Moldavian Republic. The country has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties have been re-established between the two parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, and is the second-largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna, once a thing of the past, is now a developed, bustling modern commercial center located beside a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches are interspersed among broad, tree-lined avenues, glass curtain-walled buildings, and modern shopping centers, despite the city having a more Mediterranean European atmosphere compared to traditional Turkey.
In Hardosvik village, you can see views of the nearby East Island, and there is a particularly unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are some interesting dove marble statues on some of the tombstones.
It's worth taking a half-hour stroll through this charming village.

Scotturb bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, with a stop at Cape Roca.
You can also head north to visit the extraordinary sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, which is a world-renowned site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, and this site holds significant meaning for a considerable number of people in the world.
Many of those men and women who were present at that time survived, and even more lost their loved ones here, whether they were Jewish or not – killed or worked to death.
Please treat this site with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Please do not mark or deface buildings, so as not to spoil the appearance of the scenic spot.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, while almost everyone understands Spanish.
However, most signs are displayed only in Catalan, as it is the first official language as stipulated by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other places.
The fixed announcements on the subway are only in Catalan, but the automated system unexpectedly interrupts with information in multiple languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, Japanese, and more.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
While it’s often said that one must present their best self when living in Paris, this is often an inaccurate stereotype; however, behaving in a “bien élevé” (well-mannered/cultured) way will still make navigating social situations much easier.
If you demonstrate basic politeness, the Parisians’ apparent rudeness will quickly disappear.
Sixteen Lake National Park boasts lush forests primarily composed of beech, spruce, and fir trees, blending alpine and Mediterranean flora.
Due to its range of microclimates, diverse soils, and varying altitudes, it boasts a remarkably broad and diverse plant community.
This area also boasts an extremely diverse range of animals and birds.
There is a diverse range of rare animals including European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and capercaillie, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monastery, women must wear skirts that fall below the knee and cannot show their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide veils for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own (especially a brightly colored one), the monks or nuns at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear long pants that cover the knees.
You can also borrow available items at the entrance, but these clothes are not necessarily washed after each use, so you may feel slightly uncomfortable while wearing them. Men's clothing is all one size!
Mallorca’s cuisine, like other similar regions of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is commonly used.
A simple and popular dinner is Pa amb Oli, especially popular during the summer: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie" (meaning "you" – formal), are capitalized, even when they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between verbs and objects.
This might also make reading easier, but writing becomes a bit complex due to the need to confirm whether a verb or adjective should be used in the nominalized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, after all, the spelling of most words is identical to their pronunciation.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be sure to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: “care” means dear, while “carro” means ancient chariot.
Persian grammar is relatively simple and mostly follows fixed rules.
Therefore, reading this grammar introduction will help you learn more Persian grammar and enhance your understanding of phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, Portuguese will be very easy for you to learn.
However, someone with a slight understanding of Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is very similar to it and doesn't require special learning.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today and continue to be used as museums or educational facilities.
Because light pollution was not as severe in the heyday of pre-modern observatories as it is today, they were typically located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as “hanami,” has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This idea originates from China, and the Chinese appreciate plum blossoms.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom festivals were held by the Emperor specifically for himself and other nobles surrounding the Imperial Palace.
Plants are most beautiful in their natural environment, so please resist the temptation to think "just picking one won't hurt."
When you visit a meticulously designed garden, collecting “samples” will result in immediate expulsion, with no room for discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, with extremely convenient transportation, and after entering the country you can buy almost anything.
However, due to its location just a few degrees north of the equator in a “hyper-tropical region,” you will need to cope with both the consistently high temperatures and intense sunlight (which is less common when the sky is clear).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of biblical ancestors such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Confirm that the bus you intend to take will go to Hebron, and not just to the Jewish settlements near Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways are a very ideal theme resort location.
For example, visit the castles in the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley, take a boat trip to explore the fascinating cities along the Danube River, or canoe along the Ill Canal.
Waterways also create some popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Non-believers in many Christian countries, as well as people around the world who do not practice Christianity, have also adopted these festive traditions.
There's a tradition for Easter to stay awake outdoors all night and watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological interpretations of this tradition, but it is very likely these were spring and harvest rituals that existed before Christianity.
More traditional churches typically hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night of Easter weekend, and when midnight arrives, the participating congregation celebrates together the resurrection of Jesus.
All the animals that initially came to this island arrived by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to its great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to cross the sea, resulting in giant tortoises becoming the primary herbivores of the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans first landed on the Galápagos Islands, many mammals—including sheep, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs—have been introduced to the islands.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, meaning the sun will not rise above the horizon.
Because the sky is almost dark all day, it provides an excellent opportunity to view the Northern Lights.
Due to the sparse population in these areas, there is generally no light pollution, allowing you to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
A suit is standard business attire, and colleagues will address each other by surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is very important; we should emphasize teamwork rather than celebrate individual achievements.
Decisions made by employees largely require approval from superiors, and they must follow instructions from above without raising objections.
