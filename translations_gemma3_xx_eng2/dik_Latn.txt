This is a complex sentence, and a precise, nuanced translation requires deep cultural understanding of the Dinka. However, here's a translation striving for accuracy, breaking it down for clarity. It speaks of returning cattle, a ceremony, and recalling events relating to Carter and a person named Baai: “We are returning with Tim’s cattle and goats, with the herds and the strong bulls, with the wealth of the land and the blessings of our ancestors – all these good things are a gift from God. Remember the time of Carter, and the long years of war. This is a return with Tim’s cattle and goats, with the herds and the strong bulls, and remembering the stories told around the fire.” **Important Notes:** * **Cultural Context:** The references to cattle, herds, and ancestors are deeply significant in Dinka culture, representing wealth, status, and connection to the past. * **"Dhoiŋuan" and "Thiɛ̈ɛ̈r":** These terms refer to different classifications of cattle herds and bulls, denoting their importance and quality. * **"Dhaman cënnë alɔ̈ɔ̈c":** "Blessings of our ancestors" - this is a culturally important phrase. * **"Carter":** This is likely a reference to a historical figure known to this specific Dinka community – perhaps a trader, administrator, or someone involved in past conflicts. * **"Baai":** This is a personal name. * **Repetition:** The repetition of phrases ("Në run ë Tim tök ku buɔt...") is a stylistic feature common in Dinka oratory, emphasizing the key message. * **"Lɔŋ ë tiëtë nyin Baai":** "The stories of Baai’s time" or "remembering Baai's era."
This is a complex and politically charged statement. Here's a translation attempting to capture the nuances, keeping in mind Southwestern Dinka often relies on context and implied meaning: “Regarding the issue of land and cattle ownership, and the disputes between clans, particularly concerning the issues of cattle camps and grazing areas, we remember the suffering of the people and the challenges they faced – mirroring the struggles depicted in the story of David. And regarding the time when Tim [likely a personal name or a reference to a specific period] negotiated and made agreements with foreign countries regarding oil, and the difficulties experienced with those agreements, resembling the US-China relationship and the time when Tim negotiated and made agreements regarding oil and those difficulties. It is like the situation with Iran, where Iran’s interests clashed with those of other nations, and the difficulties and complexities surrounding the time when Tim negotiated and made agreements regarding oil, similar to the situation with the Soviet Union, where Soviet interests conflicted with those of Afghanistan and regarding the time when Tim negotiated and made agreements regarding oil and those difficulties.” **Important Notes:** * **"Tim"**: This is likely a proper name, or a code for a specific historical period or political actor. Without further context, it’s impossible to know precisely. * **"Dhoŋuan"**: Repeatedly translated as "foreign countries". The context suggests this relates to international oil agreements. * **Analogies & Comparisons:** The text relies heavily on analogies (David's story, US-China, Iran, Soviet-Afghanistan) to illustrate the complexities and potential conflicts within the situation being discussed. * **Nuance**: Dinka language often carries cultural and contextual weight, making a direct, literal translation difficult. This translation aims for accuracy and comprehension while acknowledging the inherent challenges. * **"Piath mën"**: Translated as "struggles depicted".

This is a difficult sentence with potential ambiguities due to the nuances of Dinka and limited context. However, here's the best possible translation, aiming for accuracy and natural English flow: "He heard that the government is planning to bring cattle to Ed Davey’s place, a large number of cattle. A large number of cattle Norman Lamb also sent to Bεny; they said that Davey requested them." **Important Considerations & Explanations of choices made:** * **"Huhne aci jäl thöc"**: This translates to "He heard/learned that..." "Huhne" signifies hearing information. * **"nhom ku abi lök yin raan"**: This portion indicates the government (nhom) is planning (abi) to bring (yin) cattle (raan). “Lök” modifies the action of bringing as a plan. * **"tɔ akutbany ic Ed Davey"**: "To the place of Ed Davey," or more naturally, "to Ed Davey’s place." "Akutbany" signifies a designated place. * **"raan ɣon löŋ"**: “A large number of cattle.” "ɣon" means many, "löŋ" emphasizes size and quantity. * **"Norman Lamb aye tiŋ ke bi nyin Bεny"**: "Norman Lamb also sent [cattle] to Bεny." "tiŋ" indicates sending something. * **"wew nyai,erin e nyin bi Davey wän"**: "They said that Davey requested them." This is the most interpretive part. "wew nyai" means “they said”, “erin” is used for reporting speech. "Davey wän" implies Davey *requested* or *asked for* the cattle. **Disclaimer:** Without deeper contextual information about the specific situation and regional dialects, some interpretations remain slightly uncertain. Dinka is a highly context-dependent language.

She also spoke about her visit to Austria with Claudia Loesch and how impressed she was. She further spoke about her visit to Hungary with Gyöngyi Dani, and how good that trip was.” **Important Considerations:** * **Proper Names:** I've preserved "Kedït Shlalom," "Claudia Loesch," and "Gyöngyi Dani" as proper names. * **Cultural Context:** The significance of cattle in Dinka culture is immense. The translation attempts to convey this. * **"Thok"**: This word can mean "trip", "visit" or "journey". I've used "visit" based on the context of speaking about experiences with individuals in other countries. * **"Rou"**: This word means "also" or "furthermore". * **Accuracy:** Without a deeper understanding of the specific situation and intended meaning, some nuance may be lost.
