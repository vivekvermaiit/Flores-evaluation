It might not be 100% accurate, but it's the most likely meaning.

A true, accurate translation requires an expert fluent in both Jawi Minangkabau *and* English, and access to contextual information.

However, here’s the best translation I can provide, aiming for accuracy while acknowledging possible nuances lost in translation: “Later, they said, if fifteen days have passed without rain, then perform the *irov* (ritual) to ask for rain from the ancestors, or the rain will be delayed.” **Explanation of choices & difficulties:** * **مولوتائيون (molutaion):** Likely "later" or "they said" - context suggests a recounting of tradition. * **ديمولو (dimolo):** "said" or "to say." * **ساجق (saqak):** "fifteen." * **اباءق (abaq):** "days." * **ديم (dim):** "have passed" or "are." * **ڤالااءوءق (valaoq):** "rain". * **ايروڤ (irov):** This is a specific Minangkabau ritual for requesting rain; a direct equivalent doesn’t exist in English. I've left it as "irov" and added a note that it’s a ritual. * **منچاتاءق (menjataq):** "to ask/request." * **نامو (namo):** "from." * **ڤولاو (volao):** "ancestors." * **ديسينن (disinan):** "then," or "if." * **ساباڬاي (sabagai):** "will be" * **اله فورموس (ale formos):** "delayed" or "late." *Formos* is an older Minangkabau word. * **اتاوه (atau):** "or." * **نن رنچق (nan ranjak):** "be delayed" It's important to note that without further context, this translation is based on my understanding of Minangkabau language and culture. The specific meaning of some words could shift depending on the local dialect and the overall situation where the sentence was used.
