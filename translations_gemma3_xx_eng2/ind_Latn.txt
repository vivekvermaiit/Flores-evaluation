Even though one experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce mortality from Ebola, as of now there is no definitive cure proven effective for treating existing infections.
ZMapp, one of the first antibody cocktails used in the field, initially raised hopes, but several formal studies indicated that its benefits in preventing death were less than expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments against it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute necessity of prioritizing the well-being of the Olympic family in promoting a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that, for the benefit of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, it is better to make significant changes within our organization going forward, rather than revoke certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers—a widely circulated theory—but also potentially provides details that fossils usually can't, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say this animal's plumage is chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid underside.
This discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked well-developed shafts, called rachises, but possessed other characteristics – spines and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure indicates that it wasn't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers argue that, although this is a dinosaur hatchling's tail, the sample shows feathers of an adult bird, not a chick’s down.
Researchers believe that, although this is a dinosaur hatchling’s tail, the sample shows feathers of an adult bird, not downy chick feathers.
A car bomb that exploded at a police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning has killed two police officers and injured more than 20 others.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: It is known that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by the brightness of their light, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which relates to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is regarding magnetic reversals.

The work done is largely theoretical, but this program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team will be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as tides occur due to the moon pulling on Earth, the Milky Way imparts force upon the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around galaxies is located around the galaxies in the form of a halo, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been an antiquated experience: voters enclose themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate, and insert it into an envelope.
After the officers verified the voters’ identities, the voters inserted the ballots into the ballot box and signed the voter log.
French election law regulates the process quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and monitors can witness that no envelopes were present before the start of voting and no envelopes are added, except for those that are properly accounted for and belong to legitimate voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police officer Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their face covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house that was hit by a car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed and emergency services have extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that moment on, Adekoya at Edinburgh Sheriff Court was accused of murdering his own child.
He is being held awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised as his photo has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in England, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and the courts view the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists appear to be walking a dangerous path if they publish photos of suspects, etc.
The Crown Office, which is overall responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until charges are filed.
That document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine desires based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Another topic reported was the future of Jerusalem, holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence for ten years in the valley once the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
Shooters in additional pest control trials must be closely monitored by guards because the trials are monitored and their effectiveness is evaluated.
In partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first culling operation have received thorough training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in before a newly formed nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly’s fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP head as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The investigation was Martelly’s response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes turning violent, were sparked by the cancellation of elections that were originally supposed to be held since 2011.
Sixty cases of iPod malfunctions have been reported, characterized by devices overheating, resulting in six fires and four minor burn injuries.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it has become aware of as many as 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by saying the delay of Apple's report was "deeply regretted."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office says no damage has been reported in the commonwealth.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead as of now.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old woman who wanted to use the restroom. Mendoza was then shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in the medical field.
She was trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor during his spare time.
Her research shows that when given hormones, fetal lungs will mature more quickly.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, “black boxes,” on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a blue moon night. As unique as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as frightening as I am... even perhaps more... I loved her and will miss her... may she now be in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposing Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
In a poll regarding this view, 34 percent of respondents want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is now in doubt due to his complaint.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to manage his pain, as it was banned from the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Some people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets are the source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, particularly how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
He speculated about running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reducing carbon emissions.
This device utilizes satellite-based technology, rather than older land-based radar technology, to help air traffic controllers pinpoint the precise location of aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transportation will not be operated and diesel trains will not stop at Wembley. No parking facilities, drop-offs, or car parks are available at the venue.
Concerns about a lack of transportation increase the possibility that the match will be forced to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published in a scientific journal on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species evolved in just two generations. Previously, this process was believed to take much longer. This was due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be processed into various shapes, including being rolled into small forms.
Gold can be drawn into thin wires, allowing it to be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It can also be made extremely thin, sometimes used as decoration in hand-painted books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is an acid or a base (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (because a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then press into balls with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of plumbing systems have been found in many houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes integrated with public bathhouses, where men and women used them together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive calls and then bounce them back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere alters some of the light and our view.
A giant rocket taller than 100 feet is needed to put satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has changed the world in remarkable ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to provide easier and faster transportation.
This leads us to trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
Medium-sized cats, those found beneath [a certain level in the food chain/a specific classification], prey on medium-sized animals, such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including escaped pets) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is a niche concept, a specific job undertaken by each cat to keep them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male siblings, along with 30 females and their offspring.
Females typically form close bonds with one another, as extended families of sisters and daughters.
Male lions behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-around athlete, tigers can climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times stronger than humans.
Tigers are still in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. All four of these cats are the type that can roar.
The sound of a tiger’s roar is unlike a lion’s roar, which is full-bodied, but more resembles sentences where the words are spoken with growls and screams.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals ocelots hunt are much smaller in size.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and search for animals to eat (prey on) by scent, sniffing out the tracks of their prey on the ground.
They can see clearly in the darkness with their night vision, and also move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings, then ambushing them.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from its original main population (such as if they move to the mountains or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often encounter an environment different from the one they previously inhabited.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to become stronger competitors than they needed to be before.
Their original population hasn't changed at all; they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to its new environment, they appeared to decline similarly to other populations.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call it the process of speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they inhale carbon dioxide that humans exhale (which means, they breathe).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator in its time, and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is packed with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, also accompanied by an extra row along the roof of its mouth. This means nothing can escape once it enters that mouth.
We don’t know for sure yet, but it’s likely its tongue is forked. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly it has been a cannibal all along.
That also attacked anything that entered the water, including giant dinosaurs like T. rex were unable to compete with it.
Although most of their food isn't foreign to us, the Romans did contribute to strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference is that while poor people and women eat their meals sitting on chairs, wealthy people prefer to enjoy banquets while relaxing and savoring their food.
Ancient Roman food could not include foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonian people built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the god’s dwelling place.
The people will bring offerings to the gods, and the priests will strive to fulfill the gods’ needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and a sanctuary inside, which may only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special tower-like structures in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not so important.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The woman is cooking in the yard, shops used to be only open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the house.
There were no large forests in the Land of Canaan, which is why wood is so expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Nordic sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of the discovery, the Eskimo people had already been living there at that time.
Although each country is considered 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever watched the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite the writing on the back, this document is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document in reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, that notation was likely inserted just as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unconquered.
That territory was governed by Vichy France. They were French people who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the occupiers rather than fighting them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1944. This invasion was codenamed "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture practiced collectively by a group of people who live and work together, as a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word *civilis*, meaning civil, related to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, and this also becomes a measure of the size of a society.
City-states were pioneers of nations. A culture of civilization means the continuation of knowledge across generations, the remaining cultural traces, and natural dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as worthy civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen original states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes. Because there was no national executive or judiciary, Congress relied on the authority of the states, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all of its actions.
He also does not have the authority to override tax regulations and inter-state tariffs.
Those articles require unanimous agreement from all states before they can be amended, while the states disregard the central government, causing their representatives to often be absent.
Italy's national football team, as well as the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include: soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
The most popular winter sport in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japanese people have almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 6th largest island country in the world. **Note:** The original Indonesian sentence states 7th largest *island*, but based on land area, Japan is generally considered the 6th largest *island country*. I've translated it to reflect this common understanding for accuracy. If a strictly literal translation is required, please specify.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
The story of Taiwan began as early as the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or “beautiful island.”
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, and initiated a transformation in local grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers to work in rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the west and north coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windowed Room.
Most of the buildings along the complex's perimeter have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better sense of what it originally looked like.
In 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
To this day it is still produced, but more importantly, its rational aspect has been inherited by the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The actual 35mm format is somewhat confusing, having a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore stated as 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS format groups) have this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The rule of thirds, most often violated and underestimated, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order within an image.
It is stated that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During a historical period in Europe, the Catholic Church (which became wealthy and powerful) was closely monitored.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power influenced everything, from the king to the common people.
One principle of Christian teaching is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty. The church’s monetary funds are available for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether the teachings have been fulfilled.
Immediately after hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
That strategy proved effective, cutting off critical military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violates generally accepted international law codified by numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering all parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response in the unending submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and the nation was pacifism and isolation.
Having witnessed the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, many nations resolved to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, one book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different periods of time; each stage in China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there were periods of instability with fragmented provinces. The most popular story from this time is the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which takes place over a 60-year period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce warfare occurred among the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in Ancient Chinese history, with thousands perishing in their struggle to claim the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political impacts such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolute rule to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Furthermore, following that revolution, job openings were made available to all male applicants, creating opportunities for success for the most ambitious among them.
The same applies to the military, as instead of soldier ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class citizens from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply drawn to matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave that later became known as "Hira'" on Mount "Nur" (light) to meditate.
He withdrew into himself, enduring across time, offering a vivid portrayal of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the summit of one of the mountains north of the city of Mecca, the cave was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, this place is not easy to find even when someone knows it exists. Once inside the cave, the condition is total isolation.
There was nothing to see but the beautiful, clear sky above and the mountains all around. Very little could be seen or heard from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt’s Valley of the Dead, features several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the magnificent Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
The “rising arc” mark looks like the letter V, and the “falling arc” mark looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
Up means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upstrokes generally produce a softer sound, while downstrokes are stronger and more defined.
Don't hesitate to add your own markings, but there's a musical reason for the printed bowings, so they should usually be followed.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (eleven-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King’s sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
By carriage, they made their way back to Paris, surrounded by a crowd shouting and issuing threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their train wide.
At one point, one of the mob brandished the head of a slain royal guard before the terrified Queen at Versailles.
The costs of the US imperialist war of conquest in the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to finance most of the expenditures and interest on floating bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The abundant profits gained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, a fundamental benefit to US imperialism.
To understand the ordinances, one must understand the context that led to their creation.
The period during which these events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, from the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries of European history (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages spanned from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, conventionally ending around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term whose practice encompasses a variety of ideas, ranging from technological drive or technological necessity to the strict understanding that human destiny is propelled by the fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology ultimately has inherent “effects” on society, rather than being simply socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that cars should lead to the development of highways.
However, the national highway network is not economically viable for just a small number of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a high number of road accidents, which spurred the development of new techniques in the medical world to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism possessed a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerge, and these, in harmony with the place of communities, are superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the world capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was once considered the capital of feudal European fashion.
Its fame as a center of luxury began in the 400s and lasted until around 1100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, particularly as the Crusaders returned with silk and spices as prizes that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west could lag 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time was a result of the Crusades, as people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, typically organic, and utilizes locally saved seeds from the eco-region, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture and differentiate it from others can include language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures typically signify their affiliation through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their development.
Children like these are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this child neglect is due to parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Children living on the streets may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some say they have lived alone in the wild.
If raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that raised it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
When project-based learning is intended to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but rather a support system that provides assistance to individuals undergoing new learning experiences, such as using new computer programs or starting new projects.
Scaffolding can be virtual and physical; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software and aims to question, prompt, and elucidate procedures that may present challenges too significant for students to solve independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
Children shouldn't grow up in environments that are not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that is often the reality.
We consider the Foster Home System a safe zone for these children.
Our childcare system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide everything that was lacking in the home they were previously taken from.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratifications seeking.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording led to the important discovery of interpreting microexpressions, facial movements, that occur in milliseconds.
Specifically, it is stated that we can detect whether someone is lying by correctly observing their microexpressions.
In his paper titled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrates how someone who doesn't understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggested that the ability to interpret human behavior in that way might be possessed by animals such as pet dogs.
20th-century research shows that there are two genetic variations: hidden and revealed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expression variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant sources.
Additionally, failure to do so has serious consequences, namely stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant-based source is the protein found in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest unless it is cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors overcame the "protein problem" in a way almost similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna do now.
Sleep disturbance is the process of you waking up intentionally during a normal sleep period, then falling back asleep shortly after (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully rousing you.
If you restart the clock while asleep, then the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (specifically water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, forcing people to wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Everyone has the potential to find peace and absolute fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing holding us back is our own tension and negative traits.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but later expanded upon them with the emphasis of Mahayana compassion and with many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Fundamentally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love for all.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The central meditation practice of Tibetan people is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and an awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the US. With the end of the war and the conflict of systems, processes, and cultures, the fall of nations resulted.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
That war lasted for the next 40 years and would be fought in reality, by proxy forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had collapsed, and their only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, this plan became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Polish territories, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods over long distances remains the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional mission of the navy is to ensure your nation can maintain its ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously denying that ability to your adversary.
One of the most important and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in WWII. America tried to move troops and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which largely utilized U-boats, once attempted to prevent this congestion.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer England just as it did with other European countries.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise goats for easy access to their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Pet goats typically oversee herds wandering to hillsides or other grazing areas. Goats are often used by children or adults as guides, similar to how shepherds use them. This herding method is still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the railway tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, with this system horses could pull carts faster and haul heavier loads compared to slightly rougher roads at the same time.
Rail pads were introduced early on to hold the track in place. However, it was gradually realized that the track would be more efficient if it had an iron layer on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused the wooden wheels on carts to wear out more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rail completely made of iron was born.
The first form of transportation known to humankind was walking. With the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) two million years ago, humans began to walk upright.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as commonly believed.
Evidence of bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce the impact caused in the future.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problem, and we must disable it.
It is quite clear that the world is developing due to science and technology, while overpopulation and wasteful human lifestyles are becoming significant problems.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was carried several blocks to the print shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
That document was first read publicly by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The known 25 Dunlap broadside is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaled and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, as computer jargon dictates.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite common, making a prompt diagnosis difficult.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be seen from the presence of openly stored medication or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the first aid instructions label specific to a particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term originates from a past familiarity with bedbugs, which are remarkably adaptable insects as parasites on humans.
Both predatory ladybugs and bed bugs are nidicolous animals, adapted to live in the nests or homes of their hosts.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 registered cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
Couples can decide that for the sake of their own well-being, or for the well-being of their child, to raise the child.
This couple can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
This is not done in isolation; experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, posing questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and specifically on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's view on all scientific problems, including psychology, has been accepted.
As interest in Greek knowledge waned, the West found itself uprooted from the foundations of Greek philosophy and science.
Many have noted that rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living organisms, including fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants.
The biological clock is a self-sustained oscillator that will continue a cycle’s period running freely even when external cues are absent.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was a key piece of evidence suggesting that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into bacteria.
They have conducted two experiments, namely labeling the DNA within the phage with radioactive phosphorus and labeling the phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of activities at the location include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks, as well as learning about information regarding the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Kalimantan.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to work and pass others who are heading to the place they just left.
In this dynamic ride-sharing system, everyone is connected to and supports a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Current science indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere out of one of the stable states that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are such complaints arising regarding the transportation system, why do their services consistently fail? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on right now?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with one another.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have reasonable consistency and can be more or less represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship aids in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to explore space. Their ability to fly helps them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings flat against their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of options for small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people believe him to be right, but many others believe the opposite; the Solar System, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't *feel* like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width of approximately 9.6 kilometers.
Approximately 20 percent of the water flowing from rivers across the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is the main river, stretching 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It contains water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramid constructions were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a language used daily by most people who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things are made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Essentially, alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small—so small, in fact, that a period at the end of this sentence could contain several trillion of them.
Upon its emergence, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, the status and use of pencils declined.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to use a pencil sharpener.
People can only wonder what will become of keyboards when something newer comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is required to form an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under Maria and thicker under the highlands.
There’s a possibility of more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner there. Lava rises to the surface more easily.
The theory of motivation focuses on discovering what drives people or what interests them.
These various theories suggest that humans possess certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature.
This theory analyzes the characteristics of people that make them desire something, and the factors in the environment that cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known motivation theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual, feeling they must change everything the team has done and do it alone.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to division between leaders and team members.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as points of contact for their respective in-person groups.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet across various time zones that their local management may not understand.
The actual arrival of the "phantom team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) also becomes a unique component of virtual teams.
"The 'shadow team' is the management team to whom each member reports. This unseen team sets the standards for each member."
Why would organizations want to go through a time-consuming process to establish a learning organization? One of the goals of practicing the concept of a learning organization is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively across an organization’s functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome problems can generate new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, this data narrows the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors impact changes in behavior and some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information as well as material for constructing a simulation model that helps us understand processes within our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence has strong connotations from science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnosis and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Things like these have become a separate field of study, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as has been implemented in several home computer applications and video game software.
Educational tourism is an important part of school life. Often, a teacher happily takes their students to places inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing field trip experiences virtually is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; each year the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online as an archive.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Meanwhile, students often initially experience creating blogs with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because students are usually the most critical audience, bloggers began to strive to improve the quality of their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogs also "force students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy an audience inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional classroom.
Proper blog usage "can empower students to be more analytical and critical: by actively responding to online material, students can define their position in the context of other writings and also outline their opinions on a number of issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming Canadian capital, bilingual, and features a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada’s past and present.
Far to the south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and its surroundings.
All of this and various other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders fundamentally consider to be Canadian.
The large area to the north is sparsely populated, and some parts are even almost uninhabitable wilderness.
Here's a surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans living in the US than the entire population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, to date, the largest and most distinct continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arab people also brought Islam to the region, which then flourished in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, this region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travelers are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
If you also wear a ring, that will be very helpful (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can result in what they perceive as harassment, and this is often followed by a grip on the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for your beliefs (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it should be tolerated!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya. The city was later named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookah pipes, and various trinkets, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far eastern region near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried much of the city's roads, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma is relatively safe, every trip outside of Goma must be investigated to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
This city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as offering some of the cheapest trips to trek mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Due to its relatively inaccessible location, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Currently, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
This site was a key location featured on the PBS special, *Africa’s Great Civilizations* by Henry Louis Gates.
This city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, as it has a more Arabic style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
This park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, this park charges a daily conservation and entry fee.
It might also be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to select game reserves in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name "Hong Kong" and is a place many tourists consider the main focus of their visit.
The rows of buildings that make Hong Kong's skyline resemble a glittering bar graph are further accentuated by their reflections in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across the harbor.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is crammed onto reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is a place seized by British colonizers as their own, and if you are looking for evidence of colonial territory from the past, this is the perfect place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world’s largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian region is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not merely a mangrove swamp—but also includes some trees still standing in the great forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², about one-third of which is covered by water/wetland areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Intercity buses are usually full, so it’s best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes each 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters long. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn’t open for passage until March 2017.
The bridge was planned to be fully operational by September 2017, coinciding with the planned completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoint.
The Guarani are the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish nation began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has successfully preserved much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be viewed here at other times throughout the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy polo match tickets, visit the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged at a value equal to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West shop.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the island, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also usually accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be. Ask the owner beforehand to confirm which payment methods they accept.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency off-island is almost impossible, so exchange it before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there coincides with winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; temperatures above 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be bitterly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the numbers on the thermometer indicate.
There are no distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons: because the amount of rainfall is almost always consistent throughout the year.
Even though most of the animals in this park are accustomed to encountering humans, wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from other wildlife.
No matter how docile they appear, bison, deer, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it’s best to maintain distance.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
That port was a famous naval deadlock location in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and England refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle managed by the Mau movement, peaceful gatherings in the city led to the murder of a key leader: Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's position encompassing two harbors. The most popular are located in three areas.
North Shore Beach (located within the North Harbour district) lies on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of its beaches are sandy with safe swimming spots, and most have shade provided by rows of pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes bustling with families and lined with good shops along the shore. It’s safe to swim here.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it’s not a complex beer, but it’s enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to choose from, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for travel.
Local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you're concerned.
To Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. Black coffee is simply 'espresso', cappuccino comes with a high milk content (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
There is a lot of reef tourism that takes place year-round, and accidents on the reef as a result of it are very rare.
Even so, listen to advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April dating back to 1770. These jellyfish can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not actively found in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through travel agents as well.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your trip (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests must be arranged through the travel agency first, and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the show, you should come earlier to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there are areas of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If navigating the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as the noise is extraordinary when passing through ice, especially for those most affected.
The Saint Petersburg cruise ship includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the requirements).
Casinos typically make many efforts to optimize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, beverage, and entertainment offers to keep guests happy and encourage them to stay on the premises.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs clear thinking, and all skilled gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or through mountainous regions needs to account for the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On slippery and snowy roads, there's low traction and you can't drive like you would on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, you could be trapped by rapidly collapsing snow.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are normal in many countries and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the tourism activity with the greatest appeal in Africa and is a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term "safari" refers to overland journeys to view Africa's magnificent wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, therefore standard equipment is sufficient for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes prefer to remain hidden and are best viewed with binoculars.
Safaris (also known as "bushwalking", "safari trekking", or simply "walking") involve trekking, lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Several sporting events will be held at a number of other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will become the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, following its first time in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies were not extended beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most event tickets will be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if they are not available in the room.
If an iron is unavailable or you prefer not to wear ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is considered sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider purchasing sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are unfamiliar with back home.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or, in more severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit diseases.
Contagious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with their strength, are usually not included in the category of pests.
Shopping at duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from tax and excise duty at a number of locations.
Tourists traveling to high-tax countries can sometimes save money on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently traversing remote, rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are many steep hills, narrow roads, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are lower than on the preceding and following sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it’s important to adhere to them strictly rather than exceed them.
Although, surprisingly, cell phone service is stronger here than anywhere else along this route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cookies are quite good, and in Bavaria the cookies are particularly rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit cookies are common, with apples baked into cookies year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular pastries are often well-suited to be paired with a strong cup of coffee.
If you're craving a small but flavorful pastry, try a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region you’re in.
Curry is a dish consisting of spices and seasonings, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes. In South India and several other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
There are 17,000 islands to choose from, and Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term tends to refer to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, offering a variety of dishes with simple seasonings. The main seasonings favored in Javanese flavors are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Sanggurdi is a footrest for the driver's feet that hangs on either side of the saddle.
It provides greater stability for the rider, but could potentially pose a safety issue due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting caught in it.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs. To minimize the risk, a number of safety precautions are taken.
First, most drivers wear driving shoes with smooth, narrow heels and soles.

Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving gliding on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing has become a primary travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes nicknamed "ski bums"—people who plan their entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing has existed since around the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also known as ski touring or ski mountaineering.
This is related, but usually has nothing to do with ski touring or alpine-style climbing, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires much sturdier boots and skis.
Think of the ski route as a familiar hiking route.
When conditions are good, you can travel much further than on foot – but rarely can you go as fast as cross-country skiing without carrying a heavy backpack on a groomed trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to a number of these countries requires us to apply for a visa and go through passport checks more than once.
The Schengen Area, however, functions in much the same way as a single country in this regard.
While remaining within this zone, you generally can cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, saving you time, money, and documents.
There is no universal definition determining which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Several tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.

Handicraft products can be defined as antiques even if they are younger than mass-produced similar items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture related to its trade is also important for many people and many professions.
Although traditionally, not all Sámi herded reindeer on a large scale – many instead lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, utilizing reindeer primarily as working animals.
Currently, many Sámi people work in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.

Books and magazines about surviving in the wilderness are common, but publications discussing the battlefield are few in number.
People planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to reflect a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies greatly.
Security checks at checkpoints also became far more intrusive after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
Transgender individuals before surgery cannot pass through scanners without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents flowing away from the shore caused by breaking waves, often near rocks or similar formations.
Due to its underwater topography, back currents are concentrated in some of the deeper sections, and fast currents to the deep waters can form there.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which is an impossible effort.
Once out of the current, swimming back isn't as difficult as usual.
Try to go to another place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for help to arrive.

Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have a difficult time readjusting to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
When you travel abroad for the first time, people may be patient and understanding, knowing that tourists in a new country need time to adjust.
People might not expect that understanding and patience are also needed for returning travelers.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most captivating attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramid in the dark, and you can see it quietly before the show starts.

When in a remote location and without cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for mobile phones because you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
That service is frequently used by shipping companies, including cruise ships, and also by expeditions requiring long-distance voice and data communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on how to connect to this service.

Finland is a great destination for boating. This "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also boasts thousands of islands, both in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't need a cruise ship.
Even though coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for cruise ships, smaller boats or even kayaks will offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland; seven out of eight people own a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is conversely quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises prioritize longer stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several full days while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If traveling by ship only, you do not require a separate visa (as of 2009).
Several cruise lines are including Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and visits to the city are not included in the cruise fare.

The surest way to fly in first or business class is to spend a lot of money to redeem the benefits (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, it’s not cheap: as a rough estimate, you might pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times as much for first class.
Generally, there’s no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of flyers willing to pay more to reach any destination quickly, comfortably, and at a premium price.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.

The Parisian brusqueness will quickly evaporate if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park boasts dense forests, primarily filled with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and showcases a blend of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.

When visiting the monastery, women are required to wear a skirt that covers the knees and also covers their shoulders.
Most temples provide cloths for women who don't bring their own, but if you bring your own, especially one that is brightly colored, you will receive a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the garment isn't washed after another user wears it, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing this skirt. One size fits all men.
