This thing doesn’t confirm, but it does suggest that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widely accepted theory anyway. But it also provides details that fossils generally can’t, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal’s feathers were chestnut brown on top and its underside was pale or the color of carotenoids.
The discovery also provides a deep understanding of feather evolution in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don’t have a fully developed skeletal chain, called a “spine,” but possess other feather characteristics – like protrusions and micro-protrusions – researchers concluded that the spine was likely a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The wing structure suggests they weren’t used for flying, but rather for regulating body temperature or for display. Researchers suggest that although this night belongs to a small dinosaur, the sample shows fully developed feathers, not the down of a hatchling.
Researchers indicated that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the sample shows fully-grown bird feathers, not fledgling down.

As for the completed work, most of it is theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations that were recorded of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is attributed to tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way galaxy attracts the Ram galaxy.
Scientists have deduced that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter affects it.
That theory clarifies that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around it in a halo-like formation, and is composed of small particles in large numbers.

Dr. Tony Mol discovered a case of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new, changing form of the bacteria "causes great worry and fear because of the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Mol believes that some patients, including two hospital staff members, may have contracted the virus inside the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can potentially transmit the disease to between 10 to 15 close contacts.

The candidates are able to send representatives to monitor every part of the process. And in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under intense supervision, following specific procedures.

The draft law stipulates placing a label reading "18" on violent video games sold in the state of California, and penalizes selling them to minors with a fine of up to $1000 per offense.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, issued a statement this morning announcing the trial of Hohne and Pryce.
He resigned from his position, and it was decided to replace him in the Council of Ministers with MP Eid Dively. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take over the position of Minister of Business that Dively is leaving.
They and Bright are scheduled to appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
Among the casualties were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Kodibak, 21; Kodibak was the driver.
Edgar Figueroa sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider required reconstructive surgery to his face.
“Schneider” suffers from constant pain, blindness in one eye, and has lost part of his skull; his face was reconstructed with titanium—all of this happened while the “Oka” weapon malfunctioned as it was aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider testified via video link from a US Air Force base in his home country.
Following the Wednesday event, Karbanido competed in two individual races at the championship.
Her first race was a slalom, where she got a "did not finish" result in her first run. A total of 36 out of 116 competitors received the same result in that race.
In her second race – the giant slalom – she achieved tenth place in the women’s sitting category with a combined run time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Hungarian Gyongyi Dani.
Four disabled team skaters failed to complete their laps, and 45 out of a total of 117 skaters failed to achieve a ranking in the giant slalom race.
Madhiya police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone +D812.
And the Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said, “We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop.”
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambru Kanjar, Ghaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police chief, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite the presence of three people inside the house at the time the car collided with it, not one of them was injured.
But the driver was injured with serious head wounds.
They have temporarily closed the road where the collision occurred, and at the same time, emergency services extricated the driver from a red Audi TT.
They had initially rushed him to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
And then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that time on, Adekoya became accused in Sheriff Court Edinburgh of murdering her son.
She is still being detained, and they are waiting to press charges and hold a trial, but any eyewitness testimony might be questionable as her picture has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other places in Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have considered that publishing images can be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "it seems to me that journalists are certainly heading down a dangerous path because they published photos or something similar of the suspects’ rights."
The Attorney General's office indicated to journalists that there would be no further comments until at least an indictment is issued.
According to the leak, the document will reportedly refer to a dispute over borders, with Palestine wanting borders based on those that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
The other topics that are said to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a significant issue for both peoples, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the Jordan Valley for a period of ten years, immediately upon the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to the continuation of this presence for only five years.
The guards were supposed to closely supervise the released individuals during the supplementary pest control experiment, as the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In partnership between the “National Parks and Wildlife Authority” and the “Australian Sporting Shooters’ Association”, qualified volunteers were selected within the framework of the association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage at NPWS, the four fishermen selected for the first hunting operation have received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martelli took the oath yesterday before a new temporary electoral council of nine members.
It is the fifth interim electoral council for Martilly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the temporary electoral council as part of a set of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee served as a firm response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, erupted due to the failure to hold elections that were supposed to be held since 2011.
Approximately 60 reports have been received of iPod devices overheating, which has resulted in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of burnout, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded to the call to postpone Apple’s report, stating it was “truly regrettable.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in North Mariana stated that no damage was reported in the country.
As stated by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there are no indications of a possible tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired from his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead as of this moment.
Six hostages were released early, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later gave up their spot to an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. And Mendoza was shot.
Like his father, Lujain pursued medicine and made it his profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist, and then began working at Auckland National Women’s Hospital in 1959.
"Legins" began investigating premature births in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His research has shown that administering one of the hormones accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
"Xinhua" reported that government investigators retrieved flight recorders, also known as the "black box," on Wednesday.
Also, fellow wrestlers praised Luna.
Tomy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first extremist queen. My first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons. A strong woman, there’s no one like her.”
Dustin “Golddust” Ranzales commented, saying: “Luna was as quirky as I am… and maybe even more so… I love her and I’ll miss her… I hope she’s in a better place.”
Among 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the proportion who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed agree with this viewpoint, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding the opposing sides in the survey, 29% of those surveyed believed that Australia should return to being a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought that Australia should never be a republic.
The fitness of the Olympic gold medalist has come into question due to his complaints, as he was supposed to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn’t take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because using these medications is prohibited in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using various devices and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets were a source for delivering water to Earth, and also the organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists wish they understood how planets are formed, and especially how Earth was formed, from when comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Como, 53, began his rule earlier this year and a bill was signed into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, which will save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
She is using a technology linked to satellites, unlike the old technology that uses ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of an aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more specific information.
There are no extra means of transport and the underground trains aren’t stopping at Wembley, in addition to a lack of parking spaces and ground-level parking and pick-up facilities.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of having to play the match behind closed doors, without the presence of the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reported on the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the evolution of new species took just two generations – despite the belief that this process takes much longer – due to interbreeding between Darwin's finches, medium ground finches, cactus finches, and sharp-billed ground finches.
Gold can be shaped into many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can also be drawn into a thin wire that can be wrapped and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin, and adhered to another metal, and it could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
They tell him the name of the pH number of the chemical substance, and you can make an indicator for this number using red hibiscus juice.
The color of kobesh juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
They measure the pH level by counting the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons—they have no electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Combine the two dry powders together, then squeeze them with clean, wet hands until they form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel a strange sensation and form a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a flushing mechanism in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the ancient cities of Minwan in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would go together in a mixed-gender setting.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket taller than 100 feet to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the shape of the world in an astonishing way; but making transport easier and faster remains its most important contribution for us.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other modes of transportation.
There are further cats of medium size below them, which feed on medium-sized prey ranging between rabbits, gazelles, and deer.
Finally, there are many small predators (including stray domestic cats) that eat a larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success lies in the concept of status, a specific function for each cat preventing it from competing with the others.
Black rhinos are the most social of all rhinos and live in large groups called herds.
A lion pride consists of one to three adult males, in addition to up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closer to each other, because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions operates like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly, these animals are similar to lions (but not the larger predators) in behavior and are very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger knows how to climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The leopard belongs to the same group (the cat genus) as lions, jaguars, and cheetahs. These four are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the full-bodied roar of a lion, but it’s closer to a shout with angry words.
Dwarf leopard cats love to eat small animals; they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they can. Almost all the animals a dwarf leopard cat hunts are smaller than it in size.
Scientists believe that genet cats track and find animals they eat (prey) by scent; they smell where they were on the ground.
You can see clearly in the darkness with night vision, and move silently as well. The dwarf leopard hunts its prey by camouflaging with its surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small number of individuals) becomes isolated from the main population they belong to (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or migrate to a new island where they can’t easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
Given the new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group needs different qualities or adaptation methods to become a stronger competitor compared to the strength it initially required.
No change whatsoever has occurred among the indigenous population; they still require the same methods of adaptation as we have always known them to use.
Over time, as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarity to other populations gradually diminishes.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will become so different that we won’t be able to call them the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans produce (i.e., exhale).
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We repair our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants as well. Without plants, animals wouldn’t be able to live.
The *Mosasaurus* was the dominant predator in its time, so it didn’t fear anything except other *Mosasaurus*es.
Her long canines were studded with more than 70 blade-like teeth, in addition to a second set in the roof of her mouth, which means there’s no escape for anything that stands in her way.
We don’t know for sure, but perhaps it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and *Mosasaurus*—it was likely a carnivore.
She also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't match her.
While most of their food is known to us, the Romans have their share of strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the zaghba.
There was a second difference, which was that while the poor and women ate their food sitting on the benches, the wealthy men preferred to hold banquets together where they reclined on their sides while having their meals.
It wouldn't have been possible for ancient Roman meals to include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn’t have a grain of rice, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and not even one of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, and it was considered the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to fulfill the gods’ needs during festivals and celebrations.
Every temple has an open courtyard leading to a secluded sanctuary that only priests are permitted to enter.
Sometimes unique towers were built in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe place for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses weren't considered very important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women used to cook in the square; the shops were merely open tables overlooking the street. Stone was used in building the houses.
There weren’t large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Humans settled Greenland sparsely. It is recounted in Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on a charge of murder, and when he travelled west, he discovered Greenland and gave it that name.
Regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there before.
There were many differences between the people, the kings, customs, and history in the countries of "Denmark," "Sweden," "Norway," and "Iceland," despite the fact that each country was "Scandinavian."
If you’ve seen the movie *National Treasure*, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that’s not true. Although there’s something written on the back of the document, it’s not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written the phrase 'The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776'. The text appears at the bottom of the document, inverted."
Although the author of this part of the text is not specifically known, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was originally stored folded.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The landings on that fateful day and the battles that followed led to the liberation of northern France, but the south hadn’t been liberated yet.
He was ruling Vichy France. These are the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a shared individual culture among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, as a society.
The origin of the word "civilization" comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means "civic," and is related to the Latin *civis*, meaning "citizen," and *civitas*, meaning "city or city-state," which also defines societal grouping.
Self-governing cities are like the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture implicitly means the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Minor cultures often fade away without leaving any tangible historical evidence and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with Congress as its only branch – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities – which were largely uncooperative – to enforce all its laws.
Furthermore, you do not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs imposed between states.
The materials required unanimous approval from all states before being amended, and the states mocked the central government to the point that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, alongside the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands owned by Japan, people often refer to Japan – from a geographical perspective – as an "archipelago."
Taiwan began its return journey in the fifteenth century when European sailors walking around recorded the island’s name as Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began altering the original grain production methods, employing Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, and following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu city consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
Its production has been ongoing to this day, but more importantly, the aspect ratio of images in digital cameras has been inherited.
The 35mm model is, frankly, a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this image is (when dividing by 12 to get the ratio to the simplest whole number) therefore it is 3:2.
It equals or closely approximates the aspect ratio of many common formats (like a set of advanced image system formats, for example).
The rule of thirds, often misused and ridiculed, constitutes a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in a clear form.
It is said that the most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
The Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity connected the European nations together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The comprehensive power that they possessed affected everyone, starting from the king and down to the common people.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the Church’s financial funds exist specifically for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question how well it adhered to the requirements of the faith.
And quickly, Britain moved to blockade Germany by sea after the outbreak of skirmishes.
The strategy proved effective—cutting off vital military and civilian supplies—despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law, as codified and coordinated in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has laid mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering large areas of the oceans, which threatens even ships not involved in the war.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its own unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were peacefulness and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid a repeat of this situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with Edison’s company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
They had a unique way of presenting different time periods in ancient China; each stage of China or each dynasty in power was of a different type.
Furthermore, between each ruling dynasty there was a period of instability and fragmented provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these times, a fierce war broke out among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died in battles for the chance to sit on the highest seats in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political repercussions, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just the ruler.
Also, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the army, because instead of army ranks being based on class, they now depend on caliber (of weapons/ammunition).
The French Revolution inspired many from the oppressed working class and other people in other countries to ignite their own revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira'" above Mount "Noor" for contemplation.
The Ghār cave presents itself, remaining throughout the ages, as a very vivid depiction of the Prophet Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it’s not easy to find at all, even if you know where it is. Once you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
You can’t see anything but the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. It’s impossible to see or hear very little of this world inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza Governorate is the only one of the Seven Wonders that remains to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century of the current era, the Great Pyramid is considered one of the massive pyramids built to bury the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the “Giza Funeral City” with the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The “up-string” symbol should look like the letter V, and the “down-string” symbol should look like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
An upper mark indicates you must start from the tip and push the bow, while a lower mark indicates you must start from the end of the bow (where your hand holds it) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more tense.
Don't hesitate to mark your own indications with a pencil, but just remember that the printed, curved markings are there for a musical reason, so you usually have to respect them.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), along with the King’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people shouting and chanting against the King and Queen.
A group of people managed to force the king and queen to open their car windows wide.
At some point, one of the gang members waved the head of one of the slain Royal Guard soldiers in front of the horrified Queen at Versailles.
The Filipino people bore the costs of the United States of America’s imperialist war with its invasion of the Philippines.
These people were compelled to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through banking houses and Wall Street.
Naturally, the large profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the primary gains of American imperialism.
We need to understand the motivating context for the organization’s creation, so we can understand the Knights Templar.
The era in which those events occurred was known as the High Middle Ages, which is a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages, and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, all of which collectively ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological necessity to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two common ideas shared in most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has “effects” on societies that are inherent to it, rather than being shaped by society.
For example, someone might say that a car engine necessitates development of the roads alongside it.
However, building a road network across the country doesn’t offer economic benefit if there are few cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also leads to an increase in the accident rate on roads, which in turn leads to the innovation of new technologies in healthcare to treat those affected.
Romanticism possessed a significant element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography arose; these were, being in harmony with the place of the community, better than laws imposed by force.
Just as Paris is renowned as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame is that it was a center of luxury, beginning in the year 400 AD and lasting until the year 1100 AD.
Her situation declined during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusades returned bearing gifts such as silk and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
And at this time, Paris was given the title of "fashion capital" instead of Constantinople.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture in the East had a strong influence on clothing.
Despite that, due to the slowness of communication channels, trends in the West may lag by about 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was people starting to use rice to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the kind of farming done to produce enough food for the farmer and their family's needs only.
Subsistence farming – which is often done without fertilizer or pesticides – is a simple system that uses stored seeds suitable for the region’s ecosystem, in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, with the goal of increasing yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still prevalent in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar mindsets and those who feel marginalized by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of members.
Perhaps the characteristics that define the distinction of a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures signify their belonging through the diverse and symbolic use of style, which includes clothing, adornment, and slang.
Among the most common approaches used to illustrate the importance of socialization is relying on the unfortunate cases of children who suffered, through neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse, and were not socially connected by adults during their upbringing.
They call these children “the wild ones” or “feral.” Some stray children were confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment was due to parents’ rejection of the child’s severe mental or physical disability.
Perhaps the feral children were subjected to abuse when they were young or experienced severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
And others say they were raised by animals; it is said that some lived in the wilderness alone.
Since it wasn't raised by humans, the feral child's behavior (within physical limits) closely resembles that of the animal it was raised by, such as fear of humans or not considering them at all.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning isn’t a method of learning, but rather a genuine aid that provides support for individuals going through a new learning experience, like using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and in-person, and to put it another way, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, and also the paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
The program internally supports interactive learning and aims to pose questions, provide motivation, and explain procedures that students might find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that doesn’t provide upbringing, care, and education, but they do.
We understand that the alternative care system is considered a safe haven for these children.
Our adoption care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care should provide everything those children lost in the homes they came from.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to usage and methods of gratification.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified by Iyengar and McGuire (1998) as novel motivational aspects when they studied public response to internet sites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions, which are movements of the face that last for a few fractions of a second.
It is specifically claimed that one can discern if a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks mentioned in his paper that the president’s speech suggests that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are able to assess truthfulness accurately.
In fact, he proposes the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals, like pet dogs.
Research in the twentieth century clarified the existence of two groups of genetic variations: one hidden and one apparent.
The mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
The separation and recombination operations work to make the difference random, wandering and revisiting between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to obtain the amino acids they need from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so will lead to dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The readily available plant resources were primarily the proteins we could get from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if they aren’t cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide protein in high quantities and contain all essential amino acids.
Considering all things, shouldn't we be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna?
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and then returning to sleep after a short time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
And you can easily do this using a relatively quiet alarm that brings you back to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to stop it.
The second set of options, based on biological systems, involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
When stress decreases, the positivity that gives life its strength increases. Everyone has the latent ability to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of reaching enlightenment. The only thing holding us back on the path to this goal is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces everyone.
"Kundalini" energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations, with "Kundalini Yoga."
The Tibetan meditation center is divine yoga. Through visualizing the different deities, they cleanse energy channels, activate chakras, and create enlightened awareness.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led the Soviet Union and the United States to cooperate, but with the end of the war, a clash of systems, measures, and cultures led to a conflict between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have now become enemies, and a cold war has begun.
It was supposed that this war would last for the next forty years, and that the fighting on the ground would be through proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had completely collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridge.
However, these plans quickly became obsolete when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Tradition holds that the function of naval forces is to ensure your country’s ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, intercepting the enemy’s ability to transport theirs.
A recent example worth noting is the Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to counter this invasion, and their weapon of choice for doing so was the use of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany likely would have been able to invade Britain just as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve it because access to milk, hair, meat, and hides was easy.
Domesticated goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and were often tended by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, much like the widely known shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Carriage roads were established in England as early as the 16th century.
Despite the fact that the old railway carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and haul heavier loads compared to the roads, which were considered very rough at that time.
They invented railway tracks a bit early on to stabilize the routes, but it later became clear with time that placing a steel strip on top of the track made it more effective.
And that has become a customary practice, but the iron around the wheels of wooden carts is causing increased corrosion.
Finally, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron ones. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation, humans began to walk upright two million years ago coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, weren’t walking perfectly upright in a stable manner.
Footprints with toes were found in Australopithecus excavations dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering a little bit.
This is exactly like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don’t just want a temporary fix, we need to know the root of the problems, and we need to end them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and problems have become bigger due to population growth and the luxurious lifestyle of humankind.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4th, they sent a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a short distance from the buildings.
And at night, they would copy between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap’s critical leaflets.”
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July eighth.
They sent one of them to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to the officers of the troops in New York on July 9th. And a copy of them arrived in London on August 10th.
The twenty-five Dunlap broadsides represent the oldest remaining copies of the American Declaration of Independence document, but the original handwritten version doesn’t exist.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs chirped while still alive—and we call them birds.
Many people don't realize they're dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there, there are a lot of things about birds that look like they’ve become similar to dinosaurs.
It has feet with protective outer layers and claws, lays eggs, and walks on its hind legs like a chameleon.
All computers used today fundamentally rely on processing information encoded as binary digits.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits – or bits, if we use the technical language of computers.
Internal poisoning may not show its symptoms immediately, and a quick diagnosis cannot be built upon the appearance of symptoms like deafness, which are common enough.
The best indicator of poisoning might be finding an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label to learn about the first aid instructions specific to this poison.
Entomologists use the term "bed bugs" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have greatly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both “bed bugs” and “kissing bugs” are characterized by a long incubation period, and they adapt to living within or near the nest/dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise an infant.
These couples might choose to adopt a plan for their children.
As part of the adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through a scientific method. This method, in reality, guides most scientific research.
However, despite that, it is not unique in this regard; experimentation and experience are considered a test that can be used to examine the validity of one or more potential hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Gospel in Latin.
Accept Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
While knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West saw itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed by physiological and behavioral science critically depend, often, on the existence of cycles and their production through biological clocks.
They established periodic rhythms, which aren’t just responses to external periodic signals, for most living organisms, including those specific to bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
They use Hershey and Chase’s phages or viruses to introduce their nucleic acid into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to label either phage DNA using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have a diverse range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are from the germline.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for enjoyment of the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done at the site include fishing, angling, photography, birdwatching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning about this type of ape (orangutans) in Borneo.
People leave the small towns in their cars every morning to go to work, and on the way they meet other people who work in the place they just left.
In this vibrant mode of transport, everyone relies on and is somewhat connected to a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems, yet everyone complains about the transportation systems.
You rarely hear comparable levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems generate complaints like these, and why do they fail every day? Are the transportation engineers not competent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic patterns is difficult because it’s impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flow enjoys reasonable consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
To better clarify the flow of traffic, they established relationships between the three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings back along their bodies.
And this gives them a larger set of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can’t fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some saw that he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because you don’t feel the earth moving, or am I wrong?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of up to 6 miles at times.
20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the continued construction of stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the pyramids at Giza are unsurpassed in terms of size and artistic excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were astonished by the ruins of their ancestors, which had been inhabited for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and has the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a language of everyday life used by most state employees, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all these elements can be discovered in nature in their original form and extracted with relatively easy methods using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed it transforms into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are a lot of elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And of course, there are minerals like silver and gold as well.
You can also obtain ingots that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is created from matter. All matter is created from tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit within the space occupied by the period at the end of this sentence.
And so, the pencil was a good friend to many people since it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and fewer uses.
People now write letters on computer screens, without needing to use a quill.
One can't help but wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it gathers energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. The core splits again and a portion of that energy is released.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with or without prompting.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust thickness reaches about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It’s thinner under Maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It would have been easier for lava to erupt to the surface.
Theories about content revolve around finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that emerge spontaneously when they reach puberty.
These theories explore what motivates some people to want to do things and the factors in their surrounding environment that cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories for content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading former peers of the same age: one is attempting to remain “like the others” (or other women).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, determining responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the contrary, the individual transforms into someone unrecognizable, feeling they must change everything the team was doing and possessed.
Ultimately, the leader is primarily responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Generally, virtual team members act as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
Generally, they have greater autonomy than members of traditional teams, as their teams may convene according to different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The existence of a real "hidden team" from (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) was described as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member submits their reports to the "Invisible Team" management team, which sets the standards for each member.
Why would any organization want to establish an educational organization in a process that is time-consuming? Innovation is considered one of the goals of applying the concepts of organizational learning.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional departments of the organization, creativity and excellence can be achieved.
And because of that, collaboration within the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of new innovative procedures that meet the client’s needs.
Before the organization can be capable of innovation, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuity as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Data associated with neuroscience provides concrete evidence for the theoretical approach in investigating knowledge. This works to narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structure and functions of the brain in ways we’ve never known before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence carries a strong connotation of science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and in addition to that, recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
They have become like these things, separate fields focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has also been used to build several software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are considered a large part of any semester. Often, the teacher might like to take her students to places where getting there by bus is considered impossible.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips, allowing students to view artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Also, sharing a virtual field trip is a nice way to remember a specific trip and exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned annually, but older versions are kept online as a kind of record.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with imperfect grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts writing to improve their work in order to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogs "force students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to feed public interest inspires students to be outstanding and beneficial (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can “enable students to become more analytical and critical; and through effective engagement with materials online, students can define their positions in the context of others’ writings as well as identify their own opinions regarding specific issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, home to a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
You’ll find waterfalls like Niagara Falls at the southern edge, and to the north there are lands of natural beauty that no one has exploited, not even in Moscow or beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered the essence of Canada to foreigners.
The large areas in the north are somewhat sparsely populated, and some have almost no inhabitants.
Just to put the population numbers into perspective, which will surprise many: the number of African Americans residing in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The islands off East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, facing the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island ever, and it’s a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent states, or are associated with France, and are known as luxurious coastal resorts.
The Arabs carried Islam to the land, and it spread widely in the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the fifteenth century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the African coast to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Regardless of their actual social status, traveling women should declare that they are married.
It’s better to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment, and that it’s customary to monitor them, hold their hands, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences shouldn't make it acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the site of modern Casablanca as a strategic port called “Anfa,” and this came after it was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, naming it "Casa Branca," but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Badiyah, while Spanish traders called it al-Dar al-Bayda’ – where they established trading posts.
Casablanca is among the least exciting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Finding places to buy traditional Moroccan goods all over the Old City is easy – things like pots, ceramics, leather goods, shisha pipes, and all sorts of cheap items – but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyragongo volcano, which covered most of the city’s streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside of "Goma" require investigation to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, while "Goma" itself is reasonably safe.
The city is also considered a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest gorilla trekking routes in Africa.
You can take a *boda boda* (a motorcycle taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the usual price (locally) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Besides being a little difficult to reach, “Timbuktu” has come to be used as a metaphor for faraway, exotic lands.
Currently, the city of Timbuktu is considered a poor city, despite its reputation which has made it a tourist attraction, in addition to the fact that it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates’s PBS series on the wonders of Africa.
The city differs very strongly from the rest of the country’s cities, as it is characterized by a more Arab than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, extending along the border with Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, and is bordered by the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is considered one of the attractive areas in South Africa, and it is also a major park among South Africa's national parks (South African National Parks).
There is a daily fee for the maintenance and entry to the park, like all national parks in South Africa.
It's better for you to buy a Wild Card, as it allows you access to a selection of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island truly lives up to the name of the Hong Kong region, and it’s the place many tourists consider their gateway.
The aligned buildings that outline the Hong Kong skyline resemble a dazzling graph appearing above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, get out of the island and wander over to Kowloon side on the opposite shore.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonists built for themselves, so if you’re looking for evidence of the region’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending for 80 kilometers (50 miles) across remote areas of Bangladesh and India along the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests aren’t just mangrove swamps; they contain some of the last remaining evidence of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges River plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, approximately one-third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and estimates suggest it now houses 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the internal station between the districts (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those going to the East and Ja'kar/Bomthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Because the buses between neighborhoods are usually full, it’s best to buy your tickets first, a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese “Coaster” buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Baroo (Nu 150) and Bunakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oyapock, Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, their length reaches 378 meters, and they have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The clear vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn’t opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is supposed to begin operating at full capacity in September 2017, coinciding with the expected completion of the Brazilian customs inspection points.
The "Guaraní" were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now known as Eastern Paraguay; the "Guaraní" group lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to second groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay emerged, previously known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year are held in December, on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
In addition to that, smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and find out where to buy polo match tickets, check the Argentinian Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West store.
They generally accept the British pound anywhere in the islands, and within Stanley credit cards, as well as the US dollar quite often.
In remote areas, they might not accept credit cards, although they may accept British and American currency; check with the owners beforehand to find out the accepted payment methods.
It’s almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you have to exchange the money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there occurs at the same time winter is happening in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
Perhaps the winter is deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
The amount of rainfall remains fairly constant throughout the year, as there aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the zoo are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and practically all large animals may attack.
Many guests get injured every year because they don’t stay far enough away, and these animals are large and wild and are dangerous for that reason – so they need to be given a special space.
In addition to that, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep your campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. And this city is located on Apolu Island and its population is just under 40,000 people, a little bit.
Abyan was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of the Protectorate of South Arabia since 1959.
The harbor was a site of infamous naval confrontations in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser, and around 200 American and German people drowned around me.
During the struggle organized by the Maoist movement for independence, a peaceful gathering in town resulted in the death of Supreme Commander Tubwa Tamasisi Lulovi the Third.
Due to Auckland being located between two harbors, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, making swimming safe, and most of them are shaded by botokwa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitematā Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches get crowded sometimes, with a good selection of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The popular, basic beer is known as "Number One," and it’s not a mixed drink, but rather a pleasant and refreshing beverage. The second local beer is called "Manta."
There are many types of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines might become more popular.
The tap water is perfectly fine to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you’re worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small, black coffee is an "espresso," while a cappuccino has a layer of cream on top (not foam), and they serve tea without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent, even though their price is incredibly high.
They take many trips to the coral reefs throughout the year, and coral reef injuries rarely occur for any of these reasons.
With that said, seek advice from the authorities, adhere to all signage, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770, and can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks are indeed present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and when they see them, they swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles usually live in the ocean, with their primary habitat located in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance reassures the traveler that they will have a place to sleep or upon reaching their intended destination.
Despite the fact that you can often book alternative forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent, they usually have deals with specific hotels.
Travel agents have gotten used to offering packages that include breakfast, and arrangements for transportation to and from the airport, or even comprehensive packages including flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or get additional documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Despite that, any modifications or requests must be directed through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp on-site and consider that an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you need to come early, and that's so you can get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have ended, there are sections of the festival that might continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals include designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are traversing the northern Baltic Sea region in winter, you must check the cabin's location, as passage through the ice causes very strong vibrations for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include a walking tour of the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos usually put in a lot of effort to increase the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are often absent, and it can be difficult to find exits.
They have a custom of special meals, drinks, and entertainment offers to maintain guests’ good mood and keep them in the building.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks for free, but intoxication impairs sound judgment and teaches all good gamblers the importance of staying sober.
Everyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snowfall, ice, or temperatures below zero.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as you would on smooth asphalt.
And during snowstorms, a quantity of snow may fall that is enough to stop you for a very short time.
Ice falling, icy winds, condensation, or ice on car windows can all limit visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally continues without interruption throughout the year.
Perhaps safari trips are the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most famous for many visitors.
They usually use the term "safari trips" to refer to traveling across the country to see the amazing wildlife in Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closely, and standard equipment allows for good viewing.
Sometimes, lions, leopards, and tigers feel shy, and you can see them looking beautiful through binoculars.
Safari on foot (also called "jungle trekking" or "hiking" or simply "trekking") consists of long walks, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games took place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021, and some of the events were held at secondary locations in different parts of Japan.
After Tokyo hosted the Olympic Games in 1964, it will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from late March onwards, most cancellation policies based on coronavirus were no longer in effect by July 2020, as that was when the Olympic Games were originally supposed to be held.
It is expected that most event tickets will range in price between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while the typical standard cost will be around 7,000 yen.
Using an iron on wet clothes helps them dry. Many hotels provide an iron and ironing board for borrowing, even if they aren’t in the room.
If there isn't an iron available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a clothes dryer, if there is one.
Don't let the fabric get too hot (which could cause it to shrink or, at worst, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, letting water sit for a minute is enough to make it safe, while in other areas you need to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in tightly sealed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers are likely to encounter pests and animals they are unfamiliar with from their original regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause annoyance, or trigger allergies in the worst cases, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Even infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are not usually described as plagues.
Shopping in the duty-free market is an opportunity to buy goods without taxes and fees in specific locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can, at times, save a significant amount of money, especially regarding what they spend on products like alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it regularly passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/hour) – and strict adherence to them is more important than anything.
And it’s strange that it’s clear that mobile phone service is much stronger here than in other areas along the way, for example, the forests of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are excellent, and in Bavaria they are very rich and diverse, resembling the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, as apples are cooked in pastries throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer months.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and people often enjoy traditional cakes specifically with a small, strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small, rich pastries, try what’s called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen – depending on the region.
Kari is a dish made of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry spices can be “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, the use of yogurt in curry dishes is widespread, while in South India and some other coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent, the use of coconut milk is common.
Indonesian food represents a broad term encompassing a large collection of regional cuisines spread throughout Indonesia, due to the existence of 17,000 islands in Indonesia that differentiate between them.
But if used without further specifications, the term tends to mean that the food originates from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Currently widespread throughout the archipelago islands, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of simply seasoned dishes. The dominant flavors that Javanese people love are peanuts, chili peppers, and sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are considered supports for the rider’s feet, hanging down on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider, but security concerns can arise due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in it.
If a horseman falls off a horse but his leg remains caught in the stirrup, the horse might drag him away if it runs off. There are a number of precautions that can be learned to reduce this risk.
First, most horsemen wear riding boots with heels and very narrow, soft soles.
Secondly, some saddles, particularly English saddles, contain safety bars that allow the collar fur to fall from the saddle when pulled backwards during dismounting.
Wadi Kushamo – the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a diverse range of walls and large granite rocks.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes between the seemingly endless potential walls, where the summits include breathtaking views from above.
Snow sports on slopes, which include skiing and ice skating, are popular sports that involve sliding down a patch of snow-covered ground on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skating is considered a major activity during travel, and with a large number of enthusiasts—sometimes known as “skate nomads”—they plan entire vacations centered around skating in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The history of skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called skiing in unpopulated areas, ski touring, or long-distance hiking on ice.
It is associated with alpine ski touring or mountaineering, but it is not usually limited to ski touring or mountaineering, as they are practiced on very steep terrain and require stiffer skis and longer boots.
Think of an ice skating trail as similar to a hiking trail.
With good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than walking, but you rarely reach the speeds of long-distance skiing without a heavy backpack and prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains a lot of independent countries. And under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means you have to go through visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
Despite that, the Schengen Area functions to some extent as a single state in this regard.
As long as you remain in this area, you can generally cross the border without needing to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you won't need to apply for entry visas for each individual country within the Schengen area, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define antiques as goods over one hundred years old, but there isn’t a comprehensive definition of what we consider antiques among manufactured items.
The definition includes geographical variations, as the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than it is in Europe.
Handicrafts may be considered antiques even if they are newer than similar mass-produced goods from the distant past.
Reindeer herding is considered an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many people in other professions.
Even traditionally, and despite that, not all Semitic peoples worked extensively in reindeer herding, but they lived off fishing and hunting and the like, and used reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Many Sami people work in modern crafts today, and tourism is considered an important income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Despite the widespread use of the word "ghajar" – especially among non-Roma people – it is considered an offensive term because it is linked to negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If the state becomes a Lush, visiting it may be subject to travel advice, which could affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You might also want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but the advice from those governments is specifically intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories are merely a summary of the political situation in a country.
Generally, the opinions offered are quick, broad, and simplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous climatic phenomenon that may cause serious damage or social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it depending on the geography, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as thunderstorms, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes.
Severe regional and seasonal climatic phenomena include: snowstorms, icy storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to familiarize themselves with any risks of severe weather events in the places they visit, due to the impact this may have on their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone needs to get professional training.
You might come across a local company when searching online for “hostile environment course.”
Typically, the course covers all the problems that are discussed here in much greater detail, and usually through practical experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are a lot of books and magazines that explain survival in the wilderness, while publications explaining war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
Governments differ in their willingness to issue passports without mentioning gender (X) or to issue new documents to reflect a desired name or gender identity.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies widely.
And inspections at security checkpoints became much more intrusive on privacy in the years following September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals before surgery should not be expected to go through scanners without having their privacy and dignity preserved.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves that break on the shore, often near coral reefs or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow concentrates in a few deep sections, and a strong current may form towards the deep waters there.
Most of the deaths were due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you swim against the current, swimming back won’t be any harder than usual.
Try to target a place where the current doesn't control you again, or, depending on your skills and if someone notices your presence, waiting for rescue might be a second option.
The shock of returning to the homeland hits faster than culture shock (shortening the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Sometimes, travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture experience particular difficulty readapting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you've adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs that were part of your country’s culture.
When I first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
People don’t often realize that patience and understanding are still essential things for travelers returning to their homeland.
The sound and light show is one of the most enjoyable things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids sneakily and silently before the show begins.
You can always usually hear the voices of tourists and vendors here. The story of sound and light is like the story of a book.
The Sphinx was placed as a backdrop and narrator to a long story.
They show the scenes on the pyramids and light up the different pyramids.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have many countries claiming ownership, and have more than a few bases – with the number of active personnel reaching 16 in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest of them is King George Island, which has a settlement called Villa Las Estrellas.
And among other places, Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a caldera, submerged by a volcano they once considered active, provides a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the Peninsula, and it is bordered by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the Arabian Peninsula merge with the plateau, and then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains, which extend for 360 km, and are divided by the Minnesota Glacier river.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, whose summit reaches an elevation of 4892 meters – Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, where there is no cellular network coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
Satellite phones aren’t always a replacement for mobile phones; you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used via satellite communication, including pleasure boats, as well as exploratory missions that require remote data and audio.
It is necessary to have a local telephone service provider capable of providing more information about how to contact this service.
Traveling and learning are a very common option for those who are planning their gap year.
The thing with it is popular, especially among those who have finished high school; it allows them to spend a year before joining university, without risking their education.
Often, enrolling in a year-long training course abroad can improve your chances of being accepted into higher education in your home country upon your return.
Usually, there are fees for registering for those educational programs.
Finland is considered a wonderful destination for boating. “The Land of a Thousand Lakes” also boasts thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelago and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is countered by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the numbering goes from one to forty).
Most high-end Baltic cruises feature a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a few full days visiting the historical city while returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you are travelling on coastal exploration trips on ships, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some trips feature the German city of Berlin in the brochures; as you can see from the map above, Berlin isn’t near the sea and the price of the trip doesn’t include a visit to the city.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven’t traveled before or have been through a traumatic incident.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s not much different from personal fears and other disliked things that many people have.
Understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight might help some people overcome the fear that comes from the unknown or from a lack of control.
They pay good amounts to shipping companies to deliver things quickly. Time is usually very important when it comes to work documents, goods, and spare parts for urgent repairs.
The larger companies own their own planes, with some airlines, but there was a problem for the other airlines and smaller companies.
If they send things by air freight, it might take several days on some routes for unloading and customs clearance.
Sending packages as luggage that gets checked was the only way to receive them quickly, but domestic airline regulations don’t allow sending luggage without a passenger, so this is where your role comes in.
The straightforward way to be able to travel first or business class is to allocate a large sum of money to get this privilege (or it would be better for your company to handle it).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a hard and fast rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for businesses, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, there’s no point in looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines have learned well that there is a key group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in "Moldova" is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is considered the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million people, and it has the second largest port after Istanbul; it’s also a distinguished transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna was once, and is now a bustling, modern, and developed commercial center located around a vast bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers with traditional red-tiled roofs, along with the 18th-century market, old mosques, and churches, give the city a feel more akin to the Mediterranean Europe than to traditional Turkey, despite this.
Haldarsvik village offers views of the nearby Eastroy Island and features a unique church with an octagonal design.
In the churchyard, there are exquisite marble statues of pigeons atop some graves.
The job is worth half an hour of wandering around the interesting village.
The beautiful, romantic city of Scentra lies to the north in an easily accessible location, and it is the city whose fame spread among foreigners after Lord Byron’s captivating account of its wonders.
The "Scooterb 403" bus travels regularly to "Sintra," stopping at "Cabo da Roca."
And above all this, to the north, you can visit the magnificent shrine of Sayyida Fatima (a sacred cemetery), which is a site of famous Marian apparitions worldwide.
Please remember that you are essentially in a mass grave site, in addition to it being a location with a meaning that is almost immeasurable to a huge portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many other people who had loved ones killed or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with all the dignity, respect, and honor it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't disfigure the site by putting signs or ugly writings on the walls of buildings.
The city of Barcelona has two official languages: Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
And yet, most signs are displayed in Catalan because, according to the law, it is considered the first official language.
Despite that, the use of the Spanish language is common in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are broadcast only in Catalan, while unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The people of Paris are famous for selfishness, rudeness, and arrogance.
The best way to get along in the city of Paris is to behave with good manners like a "bien élevé" person – meaning well-bred, although it usually doesn’t go beyond being a wrong stereotype.
The superficial Parisian parts evaporate quickly if you offer some basic flattery.
Dense forests fill the Plitvice Lakes National Park, primarily composed of beech, fir, and spruce trees, and it is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
It possesses a large and diverse range of plant communities, due to the scope of local climates, different soil types, and varying altitudes.
The area also shelters a very diverse collection of animal and bird breeds.
There, one can find animals from rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and the Caucasian grouse, alongside many other more common species.
During visits to the monasteries, they ask women to wear skirts that cover the knees and to cover their shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide headscarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it’s brightly colored, you’ll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
And in the same way, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can borrow this violin from the store at the entrance, but they don’t wash these clothes after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Preparing food in Mallorca, like in other areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meats (especially pork), with olive oil used in everything.
"Olive oil bread" is considered an example of a simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer months: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available spices such as: cheese, tuna, and so on.
All names, in addition to the word "Sie" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even mid-sentence.
It is an important method for distinguishing between certain verbs and nouns.
One could also say that it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to know whether the verb or adjective is used in a positive form.
Pronouncing Italian is fairly easy, as some people pronounce most words exactly as they are written.
The main letters we need to pay attention to are 'c' and 'g', because their pronunciation differs based on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: Karo means precious, while Karro means cart.
The Persian language has relatively easy and often familiar rules.
Therefore, reading this grammatical introduction will help you learn more about Persian language rules and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that knowing a Romance language will make learning Portuguese easier for you.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to Spanish – meaning it’s not necessary to study it separately.
Newly built observatories are usually not suitable for daily use, and remain as museums or educational sites.
While light pollution wasn’t one of their major problems at its peak as it is these days, they usually resided in cities or university campuses, making them easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms – known as *hanami* – has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were most popular.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom viewing parties exclusively for himself and other members of the nobility around the imperial court.
Plants thrive best when left in their natural environment, so resist the urge to pick them, even if it’s just “one little one.”
When visiting a formally landscaped garden, collecting “samples” will still get you kicked out, no discussion.
Generally, Singapore is considered a very safe place and is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost anything after arriving.
But due to its location "close to the tropics"—just a few degrees north of the equator—you need to deal with both: excessive, constant heat and scorching sun (and that last one is rare when the sky is clear).
There are also a few buses heading north to the city of Hebron, which is the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs "Abraham," "Isaac," and "Jacob," and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're thinking of boarding goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Indoor water canals could be a good idea to base a vacation around.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube River, or boating along the Erie Canal.
And inland waterways also define the common routes for walking and cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Christ.
Even non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have adopted many traditions surrounding the holidays.
There’s a tradition of staying awake all night on Easter until the very end, in an open place to watch the sunrise.
This tradition can certainly be interpreted from a Christian theological perspective, but there’s also a possibility it was a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The more traditional churches often hold their Easter Vigil service on Saturday during Holy Week, and gatherings frequently begin celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ when midnight arrives.
All the animals that originally reached the islands arrived either by swimming, flying, or floating.
And because of the distance from the mainland, mammals couldn’t make the journey, and that’s what made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, mice, cats, and dogs.
If you were to decide to visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you would experience the polar night, which means the sun doesn’t rise above the horizon.
That provides a good opportunity to see the aurora, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are somewhat inhabited and light pollution is likely not a problem, you can still enjoy stargazing.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Work clothes are traditional garments, and colleagues address each other by family names or job titles.
Workplace harmony is considered a very important matter, as it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question, and they also often need their superiors' approval for any decisions they make.
