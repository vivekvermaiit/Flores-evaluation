This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but provides details that are not usually obtainable from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional presentation.
According to scientists, this animal had chestnut-brown feathers on its upper parts and, on its lower parts, feathers with a pale or carotenoid color.
This discovery also gives us an idea about the evolution of pupils in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, called a "rachis," but share other characteristics with modern feathers, such as barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these features.
The structure of the feathers makes you think they weren't used for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or for display. Researchers believe the specimen shows an adult feather, not a bird pupa, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur.
Researchers believed that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows a mature feather and not a small bird fledgling.

They discovered that the Sun's operation is based on the same fundamental principles as other stars. The findings showed that activity in all the stars of the system was oriented towards their illumination and rotation, and nothing else.
Illumination and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the value of the Rossby number (Ro), the less active the star is in reversing the polarity of its magnetic field.

The work done was more theoretical, even though the program was designed to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius constellation.
Scientists have reached the conclusion that dark matter influences another dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in an aureole form and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He stated in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming due to the very high percentage of mortality."
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, - believes Dr. Molli, - and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
Within a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

Infrared images show that temperature fluctuations between night and day suggest the possible existence of caves.
They are colder than their surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
“Their thermal behavior isn’t as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper ballot into an envelope, marking their chosen candidate.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes should be transparent so that voters and observers have the opportunity to verify that there are no envelopes inside them before the start of voting and that no envelope is added except for those of counted and properly authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives as witnesses to any part of the process. Votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict supervision, applying the relevant procedures.

Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The victims were Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old, and Nicholas Alden, 25 years old. Cuddeback had been the driver of the car.
Edgar Veguilla was wounded in the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider suffered injuries that required surgery to reconstruct his face.
Uka's weapon jammed when he aimed it at the fifth person's head. Schneider has constant pain, is blinded in one eye, is missing a piece of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
The tailor testified via a video link from a US Air Force base in his homeland.
Besides the Wednesday activity, Carpanedo also competed in two individual races at the championship.
Her first event was the slalom, where she received a "Did Not Finish" on her first attempt. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In her next race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group, with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Austrian Klaudia Lësh, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Giongi Dani of Hungary.
Four female seated skiers did not manage to finish their race, and 45 out of 117 skiers in total at the Alpine World Ski Championships did not qualify for the competition.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General, D K Arya, said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss citizen and have found her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are called Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused arrived in court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed, while emergency services extracted the driver from the red "Audi TT".
He was initially admitted to the "James Paget" hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoja has been accused of murdering her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in pre-trial detention awaiting arraignment and the start of the trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish law operates differently and courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial to the case.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee emphasizes that "it seems journalists are treading on dangerous ground if they publish photographs, etc., of suspected individuals."
The Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for all criminal prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment is announced.
According to the information, the document will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine desires according to the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
It is thought that other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, until the signing of this agreement, seeks to maintain a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian authorities agree to allow their presence for only five years.
The shooters had to be closely monitored by the guards during the additional test of pest control, as the test was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director for Conservation and Heritage at NPWS Park, four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have been given detailed safety briefings and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Temporary Election Council for Marteli in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Temporary Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheating iPods that were malfunctioning have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) announced that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced last week that "Apple" had informed it of 34 further overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry reacted by describing Apple's postponement of the report as "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 a.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no damage was reported on site.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman after she needed to go to the bathroom. They thought she had been shot with a gun.
Liginsi followed his father's example and began his career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Oakland National Maternity Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liginsi began researching preterm birth in his free time.
His research showed that, if a hormone is administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in fetuses of infants.
Xinhua reported that state investigators found two flight recorders, known as "black boxes," on Wednesday.
The moon received honors even from possible colleagues.
Tomi Drimer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Rare enough, like her herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldast" Ranelsi commented that: "Luna was as strange as I am... perhaps even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
In a poll of 1400 people before the 2010 federal elections, opposition to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed the state of Australia would become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
According to the poll, 34 percent of respondents share the view that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the final responses to the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition has been uncertain.
He hasn't been able to get the right medication to overcome his pain, as they are banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered on January 25th the largest known prime number to date.
The discovery was verified by many people using different equipment and software in early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
There is a possibility that comets were a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic materials that could create proteins and help life.
Scientists hope to understand the creation of planets, especially how Earth was formed from the collision of comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political fabrications and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite technology, compared to the older technology based on ground radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate the aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport means will be provided, and overland trains will not stop at "Wembley," and car parking facilities, as well as park-and-ride, are unavailable for the playing field.
The fear of lacking transportation increased the possibility that the game would be played mandatorily behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that the new species evolved in only two generations, despite the belief that this process took longer, due to crossbreeding between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Floriri can be worked in all sorts of shapes. It can be varnished in delicate forms.
It can be drawn and become a thin wire, which can then be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be thinned excessively and combined with other metals. It could be thinned so much that it was sometimes used to embellish hand-painted images in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of litmus juice changes depending on the acidic or basic (alkaline) level of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H+ in pH) in the chemical being analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one electron and one proton).
Mix the two dry powders, and then, with wet and clean hands, knead them together forming a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every home, connected to a fairly complex sewage system.
In the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewage systems have been found.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths mixed for men and women.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then returns it almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by means of a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel changed the world in unbelievable ways. The most important thing the wheel has brought us is that it has provided a much faster and much easier means of transportation.
She brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are cats larger than average that feed on prey of average size, ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
In conclusion, there are many cats (including domestic cats that roam freely) that eat far more small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the cozy corner, a special feature that every cat has which doesn't allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats. They live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males, together with up to thirty females and young.
Women, being part of a large family of sisters and daughters, generally have closer relationships with each other.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals with a behavior strikingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats) and equally deadly to their prey.
As a well-prepared athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is in a group (the panther genus) with lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the full-throated roar of a lion, but is more like a sentence with words of hunger and shouting.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals. When they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller in size than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals (their prey) by scent, detecting where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the darkness with their night vision and move very stealthily as well. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the surrounding environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they go to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they previously knew.
This new environment has diverse resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will require different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than a previously necessary competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look increasingly dissimilar to the other population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply implies the creation of new species. Speciation is a very important part and an inevitable consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (meaning, that people exhale through breathing).
Plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and create our clothes with plants. The majority of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the super-predator of its time, therefore it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were filled with over 70 sharp, razor-like teeth, along with a complete extra set in the palate, meaning nothing that crossed his path escaped him.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't defeat him.
Although we would recognize most of their foods, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual items for feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of dormouse called a glis.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to eat together at feasts, where they ate their meals reclining on couches.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
They, for example, had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and indeed there is no ancient Roman who has ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple called the house of the god.
The people brought offerings to the gods, and the priests strove to care for the gods’ needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, as an integral part of temples, special tower-like structures in the shape of a pyramid were built, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
The house wasn't particularly important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Life in the Jewish family mostly took place outdoors.
Women cooked food in the yard; shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few settlements. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, on his voyages west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Nevertheless, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time despite its discovery.
Even though every state was "Scandinavian," among the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, there were quite a few differences.
If you've seen the movie "The National Treasure", you might think that a treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence was written "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the end of this document, written in reverse.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the beginning of its existence, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for preservation.
Therefore, it is possible that the mark was placed only as a label.
The landings of D-Day and the subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south remained under occupation.
He was governed by the French of the Vichy regime. They were French who, in 1940, had chosen to make peace with the Germans and had collaborated with the occupiers, instead of fighting against them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragon."
Within two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the Free French movement had liberated Southern France and were continuing towards Germany.
Civilization is called a distinct and common culture of a rather large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis" which means "civil," which is related to the Latin word "civis" meaning "citizen" and "civitas" meaning "city" or "city-state," which in a way also determines the size of society.
City-states are the predecessors of states. A civilizing culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a continuous cultural trace, and a righteous spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and fail to be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies first created a weak central government – with the Congress as its sole structure – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes and, lacking a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities for the enforcement of all its laws, which were often uncooperative.
Also, he lacked the authority to violate laws regarding taxes and duties between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often were absent.
The Italian national football team, just like the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and, in 2006, they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, starting with Italians competing in both international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the grouping/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often mentioned, in a geographical aspect, as an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan date back earlier, to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island’s name as “Ilha Formosa” or “beautiful island”.
The Dutch East India Company founded a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of local grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three main buildings, specifically: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they originally looked.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It continues to be produced even today, and above all, in the same format inherited from the image sensor of a digital camera.
The 35mm format is, in fact, somewhat confusing, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (simplified by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio with whole numbers) results in 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are identical or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and frequently mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism by maintaining a degree of order in an image.
He determines that the most effective location for the main subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, was viewed with a suspicious eye.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith had bound the European states to one another, despite differences in language and customs.
His power, felt everywhere, touched everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the core dogmas of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are specifically there for that purpose.
The main organs of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being applied.
Immediately after the start of military hostilities, Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent the entry of all ships into large parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany hoped for a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
The prevailing attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations during the 1920s were pacifism and isolationism.
After the horrors and atrocities during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the "Edison" company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the USA with only 4 cents in his account, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of narrating different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that held power was a known dynasty.
Likewise, between each of the dynasties there was a period of instability with separated provinces. The most well-known of these was the Epoch of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods, a fierce war broke out among many nobles, who were fighting for the throne.
"The Three Kingdoms" was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, in which thousands of people died in the struggle to seize the highest position in the grand palace in Xian.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, job opportunities were also opened to all male applicants, enabling success for the most ambitious and successful ones.
This applies to the army as well, because instead of army ranks being based on category, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class peoples in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was most interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He would often go to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (of light).
The very fact that it survived the ages gives a very vivid reflection of the spiritual tendencies of Muhammad.
This cave, which is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing else but the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding you. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt features several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Khufu), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The “upper arc” sign looks like a V, and the “lower arc” sign like a wire clip or a square without a bottom edge.
"’I sipërm’ means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and ‘i poshtëm’ means you should start at the grip (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."
The upper register generally produces a sweeter sound, while the lower register is stronger and more defined.
You can take your own notes, but don’t forget that the curved printed markings are there for musical purposes, so they should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrified, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the king’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of merchants on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and hurling threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage fully open.
In a moment, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles before the horrified Queen.
The costs of the American imperialism's war to invade the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino population themselves.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds was floated on the stock exchange in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Certainly, the super-profits realized from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would have been the main profits of American imperialism.
Someone must understand the circumstances that prompted the creation of the order to understand the Templars.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (the years 1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a variety of ideas in practice, ranging from technological impetus or the necessity of technology, to the narrow understanding that the fate of humanity is guided by a basic logic connected to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two main common ideas: that technological development proceeds along a path of its own, beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has “impacts” on societies that are natural and unconditioned by social factors.
Someone might say, for example, that the vehicle inevitably leads to the improvement of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of vehicles, therefore new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of vehicles also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a pronounced element of cultural determinism, brought about by writers such as: Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded people and, over time, customs and cultures linked to that geography arose, and, because they were in harmony with the land and society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris stands out as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His position fell during the twelfth century, especially due to the fact that the crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the transfer of the title as the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was also completed.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may remain 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own. One of the greatest developments of the time that came as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use clasps to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses local seeds combined through crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximizing yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and the situation remains the same in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals who think alike, who feel disregarded by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the ethnicity, age, location, class, and/or gender of their members.
The distinguishing characteristics of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender-based, geographical, or an intertwining of factors.
Members of a subculture often display their membership by specifically and symbolically using a style that encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized with adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "feral" or primitive. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually by their parents); this abandonment of the child was in some cases due to the parents' rejection of the child’s severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have been victims of severe child abuse or trauma before abandonment or departure.
It is said that others were raised by animals, and for some it is said they lived alone in nature.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child manifests behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to those of the particular caretaker animal, for example: their fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, "Scaffolding" supported learning goes a step further.
The teaching method of scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a supportive tool that provides assistance to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as: using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, meaning a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the little man in the form of the paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are taken over by the software and aim to investigate, stimulate, and explain procedures that the learner may have found difficult to handle alone.
Children are sent to children's homes for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should grow up, under any circumstances, in an environment that is not encouraging, loving, and educational, but they are growing up this way.
We consider the Foster Care System as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is expected to provide loving caregivers, safe homes, secure healthcare, and ongoing education.
The caregiver is expected to provide for all the unmet needs of the home they were previously in.
The internet intertwines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal ones.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to other dimensions regarding access for uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects regarding motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they observed how audiences reacted on websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in explaining micro-expressions and facial movements that last for just a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect if a person is lying through the accurate interpretation of their facial expressions.
In his paper "The President’s Speech," Oliver Sacks showed how individuals unable to comprehend speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even believed that such abilities to explain human behavior might be possessed by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Studies of the twentieth century have proven that there are two groups of genetic variations: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
Isolation and recombination repeatedly mix variation between two groups with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid needs through plant sources in the savanna.
Furthermore, failure to achieve this has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant sources most easily accessible would be the proteins obtained from leaves and shoots, but primates like us find it difficult to digest them if they are not cooked.
Conversely, foods derived from animals (insects, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved "their protein problem" to some extent in the same way chimpanzees in savannas do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a chime clock with a relatively low volume to bring you back to yourself without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm while asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed to force someone to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person possesses is directly proportional to the level of tension in their body and spirit.
As tension decreases, vital energy increases. Every individual has the opportunity to find peace and absolute contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing preventing this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was further enriched with the Mahayana theological concept of "the path of love" and more techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is divine yoga. Through the visual representation of certain deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, bringing about cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process, and culture led to the contention between states.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and thus the Cold War began.
She would continue for the next 40 years and would truly fight, by authorized armies in war zones from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had already collapsed and the only hope was withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian border.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of regions of Eastern Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is currently the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and people across the ocean.
The traditional task of naval fleets has been to ensure your country retains the ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent and significant examples of this was the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Simultaneously, the German fleet was attempting to halt traffic primarily using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain, as had happened with other countries in Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to more easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other pastures, often under the care of goat herders who were usually children or adolescents, much like shepherds are more commonly known. These methods of livestock keeping are still used today.
The roads for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carts were made only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the somewhat more difficult roads of that time.
The crossties were installed quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more effective if they had an iron sheet on top.
This became common practice, but iron consumed more of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking; people began to walk on foot two million years ago when Homo Erectus appeared (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, australopithecus, did not usually walk on two legs.
Adaptations for bipedal walking have been found in australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked upright as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living by respecting the environment more, we can participate in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to lessen future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is akin to treating the symptoms. However, we need to find the cause of the problems and deactivate it if we don’t want just a temporary solution.
It is very clear that the world has undergone major changes due to the advancements of humanity in science and technology, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
Following its approval on July 4th by Congress, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks further to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Broadside."
The first public reading of the document was done on July 8th by John Nixon in the courtyard of "Independence Hall".
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it on July 9th before his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist today, they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can also fly.
But there are many things regarding birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws and scales, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex dinosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and, in computer language, these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite common, making an immediate diagnosis difficult.
The presence of an open box of medicines or toxic household chemicals may be the clearest sign of poisoning.
Check the label for specific instructions for rapid assistance with that particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term “kandërr” in its official meaning.
This term originates from the historical similarity with bed bugs, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Like killer insects, bed bugs are also nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or shelter of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most important neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples may decide to prepare an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
But it is not the only one; scientific study is also guided by experimentation, and an experiment is evidence used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and particularly on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in every scientific matter, including those psychological.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself severed from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many rhythms observed in relation to physiology and behavior often depend primarily on the presence of endogenous cycles as well as their production by biological clocks.
For the vast majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, recurring rhythms have been documented that are not merely a reaction to external recurring signals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that will continue a period of cycles with free-running movement, even when external signals are absent.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses, or phages, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can bring about a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations of cells from the germline can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in going to natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including plants and wild animals.
Examples of fieldwork activities include fishing, hunting, photography, birdwatching, visits to the park, and studying information related to the ecosystem.
An example is the development of visits, photography, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave towns by car to go to their workplaces, and pass by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth movement of vehicles, each one is in some way connected and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Now science shows that the massive carbon-based economy has caused the biosphere to shift from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone has complaints about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems cause these dissatisfactions, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more significant happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate within a consistent time interval; therefore, traffic flows can be mathematically approximated.
To better present the flow of traffic, connections have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This arrangement aids in the planning, design, and use of road objects.
Among animals, insects were the first to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them avoid their predators more easily and find food and reproduce more efficiently.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the length of their body.
This gives them a larger number of small places to hide from robbers.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite – that the solar system, including the Sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
This seems logical, because the Earth doesn't appear to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth, and the widest. It carries 8 times more water than the second-ranking river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles in some places.
Full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6387 km (3980 miles). It collects the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were at that time far older than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by the majority of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have had knowledge since antiquity of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as all of these can be found in nature in their original form and extracted relatively easily from mines with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. Those elements were earth, air, water, and fire.
This resembled more the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also created the theory that they transform into new matter to create everything we see.
Alloys are fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that many elements exist in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. There also undoubtedly exist metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, with his invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the status and uses of the pencil have declined.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to use a pencil sharpener.
Someone can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes out.
The atomic bomb functions on the principle that combining several protons and neutrons into a nucleus requires energy.
Much like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Separating the nucleus from the beginning releases a portion of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split spontaneously or with even the slightest provocation.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the far side of the moon.
She is thinner under the dark maria and thicker under the mountainous areas.
There may be more seas on the near side, because the crust is thinner. Lava found it easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people choose or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that stay with them as they mature.
These theories analyze what makes some people want the things they want and what things in their environment will prompt them to do or not do certain things.
Two widespread theories regarding motivation are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can stand out when managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unusual decisions, implement disciplinary measures, conduct performance evaluations, assign tasks and responsibilities to everyone.
On the other side of the spectrum, one easily transforms into a person who is unrecognizable, who thinks they should change everything the team has done and take it over for themselves.
Ultimately, the leader bears final responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior causes division between leaders and the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence are expected from virtual teams as from traditional teams, but there are some small differences.
Members of the virtual team often act as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more independence than members of a traditional team, as their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local administration.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The invisible team" is the management team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing an educational organization? A goal for implementing the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across the functional sectors of an organization, creativity and capability can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working collaboratively to overcome an obstacle can lead to a regenerative process to serve the client’s need.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical treatment of cognitive research. Consequently, they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The reciprocal link between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their studies.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and research brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has gained strong prominence in science fiction literature, artificial intelligence constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI involves creating devices for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice and facial expressions.
These things have been transformed into distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial Intelligence systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they have been incorporated into several software applications for personal computers and video games.
Excursions take up a large part of any teaching methodology. It often happens that a teacher expresses the desire to send her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can visit museum artifacts, watch an aquarium, or admire fine arts while remaining seated with their class.
Virtual field trips are also a great way to think about a journey and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of "Bennet" school in North Carolina create a webpage dedicated to their trip to the capital city; this website is modified each year, but older versions are still preserved online as a block of memories.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins efforts to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "obliges students to become more mindful of the world around them." The need to nourish the interests of the audience inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond their traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can help students become more critical and analytical. Through active responses to online materials, students can determine their positions regarding writings by others, as well as define their perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the attractive bilingual capital of Canada which has a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, and the north harbors the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and much more present Ontario with the elements that foreigners consider most typically Canadian.
The large areas located further north are very sparsely populated, and some of them are almost deserted and uninhabited regions.
For a population comparison that would greatly surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and a continent in itself regarding wildlife.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach holiday destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had a great impact on the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
The influence and colonization from Europe began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
They'll help you even if you bring a ring (just not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they consider harassment, and stalking, grabbing by the arm, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm when rejecting men and don't be afraid to hold your ground (even if it stems from cultural shifts, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was utilized by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru-l-Badia, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to bargain in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as: tagines, ceramic items, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of decorations, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the eastern edge, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava of the Niragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's roads and particularly the city center.
Although Goma is somewhat safe, you should research every trip outside of Goma to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Niragongo volcano, along with some of the more affordable mountain gorilla tracking experiences in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
In combination with its undeniable inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for faraway, exotic places.
Timbuktu is today a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger in 1990, due to the threat of desert sands.
She was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s special broadcast for PBS's "Wonders of the African World."
The city has a strong contrast with the other cities in this country, because it has more of an Arab style than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to various wild animals.
He is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is known as the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks in South Africa, the park has daily fees for entry and conservation.
You may also have the option to purchase a "Wild Card," which offers access to each of the selected parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place considered the main objective by many tourists.
The skyline of buildings forming Hong Kong's horizon has been compared to a pulsating striped graph, highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront directly opposite.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the land appropriated by British colonizers, therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, this is the appropriate place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into the Bengal and Indian coastal zone.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest in the Indian part is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not simply groves with rhizophores; they include some of the last remaining pieces of the great jungles that once covered the northern Indian valley.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², approximately one-third of which is covered by water surfaces/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a haven for wildlife, and it is estimated that the area now holds 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 deer have also been sighted.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those traveling east and to Xhakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
It is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance, as it often happens that intercity buses are full.
Most regions receive service from small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Taking taxis together is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as in Paro (Nu 150) and in Punakha (Nu 200).
The Ojapok River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Ojapok River to connect the city of Ojapok in Brazil and Saint-George-de-l'Ojapok in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction finished in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for survival.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaykurú and Pajaguá, who made a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was created as a result of the clash between Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish were the ones who initiated the period of colonization, a period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Here, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen during other times of the year.
For the latest information on tournaments and where to buy polo match tickets, go to the Argentina Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged to that of one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located at Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
British pounds will be generally accepted everywhere in the islands and, within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the more remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and US currency may be. Check with owners in advance to determine what payment methods are accepted.
Outside the islands, it is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency, so break your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zones. During the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can have a deceiving chill: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer actually reads.
There isn't a particularly "rainy" and "dry" season: the rainfall level is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park administration, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
Despite how wise they may seem, bison, boars, warty boars, bears, and almost all large animals can attack you.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don’t keep a safe distance. These are wild, large, and potentially dangerous animals, and therefore you should give them the space they need.
Besides this, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid keeping or cooking smelly foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia, founded in the 1850s, has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggles for independence organized by the Mau movement, an organization in the city led to the killing of key leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's stretch between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches and safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches along "Tamaki" Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, on the upscale outskirts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes overcrowded with people, with a variety of shops lined up near the shore. You can swim safely.
The main beer in the country is "Number One." It’s not a complex beer, but it is refreshing and enjoyable. Another local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be found more easily.
Tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "plain white" coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an "espresso," cappuccino is served covered in cream (and not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but wonderful.
Throughout the year, many journeys are made on tires, and tire damage from any of these causes is rare.
But still, respect the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea stingers (cubozoan jellyfish) appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770 Bay. Occasionally, they may appear outside of this period as well.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their primary habitat is the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Making a prior reservation allows the traveler to rest assured that they will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Often, travel agents have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find that it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to secure other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests must first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp in the same place, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll need to go early to find a campsite near the music.
Don't forget that, even if the music may have finished on the main stages, there might be sections of the festival that will continue playing music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you travel over the North Baltic Sea during winter, check where your cabin is located, as movement in the ice causes a very frightening noise for those who are more sensitive.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Typically, windows and clocks are missing, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them in their establishments.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who intends to operate a vehicle over large geographical areas or mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot steer the vehicle as you would on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, a significant amount of snow can fall in a very short time, enough to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blizzard conditions, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle’s windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather conditions are common in many places, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the main element in attracting tourism to Africa and the most special moment for many visitors.
The term "safari," in common usage, refers to overland journeys to observe the wild and fascinating wildlife of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and with standard equipment, you will be able to have a better view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, therefore you can see them better with binoculars.

Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most cancellation policies related to coronavirus no longer apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
It is expected that the majority of event tickets will be priced between 2,500 and 130,000 lek, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 lek.
An iron for damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to lend you, even if there isn’t one in the room.
If you don't have an iron or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Take care not to allow the fabric to overheat (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that they are unfamiliar with in the regions where they live.
Parasites can damage food, cause skin irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that could harm or kill people by force, are generally not considered damaging.
The purchase of goods without customs duties is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excises in certain countries.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road segment between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently traversing remote terrain of pristine forests.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep this in mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns prevail.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) – and full adherence to them is even more important than in other circumstances.
Surprisingly, the cell phone service is much stronger here than in other parts of the route, for example, in the "Pennsylvania Wilds".
German pastas are very good and in Bavaria they are very diverse and different, much like those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, starting with those with apples which are cooked throughout the year and continuing with those with plums which are cooked in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other dried fruits. Typical types of cake go especially well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Kerry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a broad term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, the term is intended to refer to foods originating from the central and eastern areas of the main island of Java when used without other qualifiers.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, features a variety of simple dishes with spices, where the dominant flavorings favored by Javanese people are: peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and several aromatic spices.
Stirrups are foot supports for the rider that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but can be a safety issue due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If the rider falls from the horse, but their foot is caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged along if the horse bolts. To minimize this risk, several precautionary safety measures can be taken.
First, the majority of motorcyclists wear boots with heels and smooth, very tight-fitting soles.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety strips that allow the girth to fall away from the saddle if pulled back by the rider who falls.
Koçamo Valley – Chile’s main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views of the ridges. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly attempting new routes among its slopes with endless possibilities.
Snow sports on hilly terrain, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving gliding on snow-covered ground with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a widespread and highly admired travel activity, with enthusiasts often known as "ski nomads" whose sole holiday objective is to ski in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very ancient – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, alpine skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first ski training club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski expedition.
He has connections, but doesn't usually include alpine skiing or mountaineering tours, the latter of which are developed on steep terrain and require much stronger skis and boots.
Think of the ski itinerary as a similar hiking itinerary.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than by walking, but you will rarely achieve skiing speeds on groomed slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, travelling to many of these states would require visa applications and numerous passport checks.
However, the Schengen area functions to some extent as a country in this respect.
As long as you don't leave this area, you can usually cross the borders without needing to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you don’t need to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There is no general definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition varies geographically, where the age threshold may be lower in countries like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products can be called antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Livestock farming of sheep (northern breed) is an important means of livelihood for nomads, and trade culture is also important for many people with other professions.
Although traditionally, the Sami people have not all been heavily involved in reindeer herding – rather they lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, primarily using reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern crafts. Tourism brings significant income to Sápmi, the land of the Sami.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "cigan" is generally considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If a travel recommendation is issued for the country you are going to, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.

"Severe weather" is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious disruption to social life, or loss of human life.
Harsh weather can be encountered anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it that can be conditioned by geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
The forms and consequences of severe weather are strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and fires, as well as storms, tornadoes, floods and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather conditions include squalls, snowstorms, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any danger from the harsh weather affecting their area, as this may impact their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a place that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
With an internet search for "Course for hostile environments" you might find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, generally with practical experience.
A course will regularly last from 2-5 days and will include role-playing, plenty of training for quick assistance, and sometimes for weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the desert are common, but publications addressing war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without declaring gender (X) or updated documents to align with desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents also varies greatly.
After September 11, 2001, security checks have become much more bothersome.
Transgender individuals before surgery should not be expected to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being violated.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves moving away from the shore, often in a channel or similar formation.
The underwater topography causes the concentration of the return current in some deeper parts, and there a fast current can form towards the depths of the sea.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while attempting to swim backwards against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and if they've seen you, perhaps it's best to wait for rescue.
Cultural dissonance happens faster than cultural shock (has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapted easily to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your homeland after your life abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of the customs from your own culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were perhaps patient and understanding, as they knew that travelers need to adjust to a new place.
People may not expect that returning travelers also need patience and understanding.
The light and sound show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
Before the show begins, you can look at the pyramids in silence and in darkness.
You usually always hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is precisely like a book of stories.
The Sphinx has been placed as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The views appear at the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Regarding the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, there are claims from several nations and there are many bases there, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston and Deception Islands, where the water-filled caldera of an still-active volcano offers an impressive natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region in the south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula join here in a braid and then reappear to form a 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are separated by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote areas, without cell phone signal, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones generally cannot replace cell phones, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by maritime transport, including pleasure boats, as well as by expeditions that need remote data and voice calls.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to provide additional information about connecting to this service.
A consistently popular option for those planning a sabbatical year is travel and learning.
This is especially preferred by those who leave school, which allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually increase your opportunities for admission to higher education when you return to your home country.
Generally, a tuition fee will be required for registration in these educational programs.
Finland is a very good destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on these lakes and archipelagos.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boat trips are considered a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but, beyond them, it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this figure is one in forty).
The majority of specialty cruises in the Baltic have an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days, while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you go to the coast only on ship excursions, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises in their brochures feature the German city of Berlin. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all near the sea, therefore a visit to this city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying on an airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things that many, many people have.
For some, a certain understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help them overcome the fear based on the unknown or the lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid to deliver things quickly. Time is often very important for work documents, goods, or exchange parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but it was a problem for other lines and smaller companies.
If they were to send the goods by air freight, for some routes it could take days to complete the unloading and customs clearance process.
The only way to get them through faster would be to ship them as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow the shipment of baggage without passengers, and this is where your role comes in.
The easiest way to fly first or business class is to gather a large sum of money for this privilege (or, even better, to have the company do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rough general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economic fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally, it's not even worth asking for a discount on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there is a certain group of passengers who willingly pay high prices for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they set prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldavia is a multiethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
This conflict led to the creation in 1994 of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religious belief in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, the majority of the signs are only marked in Catalan, as it has been established by law as the first official language.
However, the Spanish language is also widely used in public transport and other services.
Regular announcements on the metro are made only in the Catalan language, but for unplanned disruptions, announcements are made by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, harsh, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is to behave as well as possible, to act like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-bred). This will make it easier for you to be understood.
The rough exterior of Parisians will quickly soften if you show some basic good manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir trees, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large diversity of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, dissimilar soils, and varying altitudes.
The region is also the habitat of a very large number of animal and bird species.
There, one can find a rare animal world such as: the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the Eurasian eagle-owl, the hazel grouse, the wildcat, and the wild boar, along with many more common species.
When going to the monastery, women must wear skirts below the knee and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries offer headscarves for women who don’t come prepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you’ll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow these from the spare trousers at the entrance, but those garments aren’t washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these loose-fitting pants. One size fits all for men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses exclusively olive oil.
A typical simple evening meal in the area, especially during the summer, is "Pa amb Oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and whatever other ingredients are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names following the word "Sie," which means "you," always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from nouns.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although the writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to discern whether a verb or adjective has been used in a substantivized form.
In Italian, pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The key letters to be mindful of are 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciation changes based on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means cart.
Persian grammar is, to some extent, simple and generally regular.
Therefore, if you read this practical grammar, you will be able to learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand its expressions.
It goes without saying that, if you know a Romance language, you will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is very similar, and therefore doesn’t need to be studied as a separate language.
Observatories from the medieval period have largely fallen out of use today and are used as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem in their time as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, where they are more accessible than those built in modern times.
The majority of modern research telescopes are very large structures in isolated areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as "hanami," has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The notion came from China where the favorite flower was the plum blossom.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy in the imperial court.
Plants look much better when they are in their natural environment, so don’t be tempted to remove even a single specimen as a “trophy”.
If you visit a garden maintained according to the rules, even collecting “samples” will undoubtedly get you kicked out.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe and very easy country to get around, and you can buy almost anything when you arrive there.
However, since it is located in the "northern tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with both the humidity (always) and the strong sun (less often, when the sky is clear).
There are also some buses running north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take goes inside Hebron, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good theme for providing a basis for holidays around them.
For example, by visiting the castles in the valley of the Lura, the valley of the Rina, or by taking a cruise to interesting locations on the Danube, or by sailing along the Iri canal.
They also determine the routes for well-known hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians throughout the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual for spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into celebrations as soon as midnight strikes to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or rafting.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Following the arrival of people in the Galapagos, many mammals also arrived there, including horses, cows, goats, cats, dogs, and mice.
If you visit the Antarctic or Arctic regions during winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost all the time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, visual pollution is light and usually not a problem, so you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Often, workers must obtain approval from their superiors for every decision they make and are expected to follow their superiors’ instructions without questioning them.
