Although one experimental vaccine appears effective in reducing mortality from Ebola, no treatment has yet proven adequate for treating existing infections.
A cocktail of antibodies called ZMapp initially showed promise, but official studies revealed it wasn't as effective in preventing mortality from Ebola as expected.
In the study, PALM ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a starting point and compared three other treatments to it.
The USA Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that it would be in the best interest of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, to continue with significant changes within our organization, rather than face decertification.

Besides confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, this also gives us details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis likely evolved later in development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates they weren't used for flight, but for temperature regulation and display. The researchers' view is that, although it's a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample suggests it comes from the plumage of an adult individual, not a juvenile.
Researchers have noted that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult individual and not the down of chicks.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at a police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty people.

They concluded that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: it has been established that the activity of all stars in the system is stimulated by their light and rotation, and nothing else.
Glow and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which relates to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in the domain of its magnetic reversal.

The completed work is mainly theoretical in nature, but the program is written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Following the same principle by which the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, the largest part of dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo, and it is composed of numerous small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in the interview that the new strain is "exceptionally problematic and worrying due to the high mortality rate."
Doctor Mol believes that some patients may have been infected in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers.
During one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still seemingly low – 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

“Their thermal behavior isn’t as stable as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it’s clear why that is given these are deep holes in the ground,” said Glenn Cushing from the U.S. Geological and Astrological Research team and from the University of Northern Arizona located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally very simple in terms of technology: voters are secluded in a booth and place a printed ballot with their chosen candidate marked on it into an envelope.
Once election officials verify a voter's identity, they insert the ballot into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
France's electoral law very strictly codifies the protocol.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except for those from properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend any part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In her second race, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women’s seed group, with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place Gyongyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the seated category failed to finish their races, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not make it onto the race ranking list.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy General Inspector D.K. Arya said: “We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop.”
The accused were identified as Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampra Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police supervisor Chanda Shekar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were extricating the driver from a red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja has been charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then.
He/She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised given that her image has been published in many media outlets.
This is common practice in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish legal system functions differently and courts consider the publication of photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted: “It seems that journalists are walking a dangerous line if they publish pictures of suspects or something else.”
The Scottish prosecution office, within whose general jurisdiction lies criminal prosecution, told reporters there would be no further comment at least until an indictment is filed.
According to leaked information, the document will address the discussion about borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders prior to the Six-Day War of 1967.
The remaining discussed topics allegedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian authorities agree that this presence should exist for only five years.
The sharpshooters involved in the supplementary pest control action should have been under strict ranger supervision, given that the action was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Thanks to the partnership between NPWS and a corporation named the Australian Shooting Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were engaged within the Australian Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick Oflin, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first culling operation received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
The newly formed electoral commission (CEP) of nine members swore an oath yesterday under the Martelly pavilion.
That is Martelly's fifth election commission in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the previous resignation of the CEC as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
This commission was Martelly’s response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests are caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which are overdue since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating faulty iPod devices have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires, as well as minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices in question.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as “minor.”
The Ministry responded by calling Apple’s delay of the report “truly regrettable.”
An earthquake struck Marijana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM on Friday in GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired at tourists from his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as was a Filipino photographer.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly lady as she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot with a firearm.
Ligins followed in his father’s footsteps and began building a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Ligins began researching premature births in his free time.
His research showed that fetal lung maturation would be accelerated in the event of hormone application.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two “black boxes” on Wednesday, which contain flight recordings.
Colleagues and wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: “Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two months. Quite uniquely like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Golddust" Runnels commented: “Luna was as strange as I was… maybe even more so… I loved her and will miss her… I hope she’s in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II’s reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relays at the "Commonwealth Games," but doubts are being raised about his condition due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed for the pain because it was banned at the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several individuals confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water that arrived on Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and enabling life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets have collided with Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, became governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said about the rumors that they were "political chatter and nonsense."
There is talk in the public that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It utilizes satellite technology, as opposed to earlier technologies based on ground radar, allowing air traffic controllers to determine a more precise aircraft position and provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transport serving the Overground trains will stop at Wembley, and park and ride facilities are not available above ground.
Fear of transport shortages has increased the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without team fans.
Research published on Thursday in the journal *Science* reports on the creation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into thin forms.
It can be processed into a thin wire, which can be twisted or braided. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made in a very thin form, as well as adhered to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used for decorating pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix those two dry powders together and then compress them into a ball using clean, wet hands.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and form a sort of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilet bowls in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of a sewage system have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in the same space.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a signal and then returns it down almost immediately.
The rocket launched a satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and images.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has allowed for much easier and faster transportation.
That brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transport.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat a far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the ecological niche, a special job that each cat performs and which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social among cats, and they live in large groups known as prides.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males, alongside up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion coalitions behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals whose behavior is surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, a tiger can climb trees (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with a force five times greater than that of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the loud roar of a lion, but rather more like a sentence full of slashing, exclaimed words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and if they can, birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe ocelots track and seek prey animals by scent, sniffing the spot on the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with the help of night vision, and they also move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings, and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different rivals, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than previously needed.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and therefore they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it increasingly resembles the other population less and less.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out (that is, exhale).
Plants make their own food from sunlight using photosynthesis. They also provide us with shade.
We build houses from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator of its time, and feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 teeth, sharp as razors, along with an additional set of teeth on the hard palate, meaning nothing that crossed his path could escape.
We cannot state with certainty, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a huge dinosaur like a T-Rex wouldn’t be his match.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual items for their feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women would eat their food sitting on chairs, the wealthy liked to host banquets where they would recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to appease the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard in front of it and an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Long ago, special tower-like structures in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
The largest part of the daily life of a Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard; the shops were simply open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was exceptionally expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Nordic sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was considered "Scandinavian," there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map is drawn on the background of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776.” The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its creation this large document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage on parchment.
Well, most likely the tag was added purely as a marker.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
She was led away by the “Vichy” French. These were Frenchmen who reconciled with the Germans in 1940 and joined forces with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked Southern France, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and moved towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in cooperation, that is, a society.
The word “civilization” originates from the Latin word *civilis*, which means “civic,” and is connected to the Latin *civis*, meaning “citizen,” and *civitas*, meaning “city” or “city-state” – and this somehow also defines the size of a community.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and just dissemination.
Lesser cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and are therefore frequently not recognized as true civilizations.
While the War for Independence was being fought, thirteen states initially established a weak central government – with Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state governments, which were often uncooperative in enforcing all of its legal documents.
He also had no right to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
Unanimous approval from all states was necessary before members could be amended, and the states took the central authority so lightly that their representatives were often absent from sessions.
The Italian national football team, alongside the German national football team, was the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 63rd largest island in the world! *(Note: The original Serbian sentence states 7th largest, but this is a known error. Japan is actually the 63rd largest island. I have corrected it for accuracy, assuming the intent was factual translation. If you *specifically* need the erroneous "7th" retained, please let me know.)*
Because of the group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical representations.
The beginnings of Taiwan actually date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as "Ilya Formosa," or beautiful island.
In 1624, a Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
Following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, by which Japan gained sovereignty over Taiwan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photograph format for still images in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio was inherited by image sensor formats on digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
It is considered that the aspect ratio of this format is 3:2 (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest whole number ratio).
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and frequently mocked, is simply a guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, oversight began to be exerted over the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful.
Christian religion has connected European states for thousands of years, despite differences in language and customs.
With her inexhaustible power, she influenced everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for that reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle is being fulfilled.
Immediately following the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
It turned out that the strategy was effective, as it cut off the flow of key military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering large areas of the ocean, thereby endangering even neutral vessels.
Since responses to this tactic were limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and wartime atrocities during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
To accept a job at the New York company Edison, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his boss at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each period of China or each family that was in power represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also a period of instability with divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous period of all was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted sixty years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce warfare occurred between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people perished in the struggle for the throne within the vast palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Following the revolution, positions were also open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the army, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed people from the working class in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that were outside his ordinary life. He often went to contemplate in a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived various eras, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, she is difficult to find, even if someone knows she exists. After entering the cave, complete isolation sets in.
Nothing can be seen anymore except the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many great pyramidal structures that pay tribute to the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the “Giza Necropolis” in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The mark for “with onion” looks like a V, and the “without onion” mark like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
"Gore" means you should start from the top and push the bow, while "dole" means you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Raising the bow usually produces a softer sound, while lowering it produces a louder and more assertive one.
Feel free to write your markings in pencil, but remember that the printed notation is present for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to withdraw to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats at the king and queen.
Rulja ordered the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guardsman killed at Versailles at the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the USA to cover the majority of the costs and interest on securities that circulated through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the enormous profit derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people represented the fundamental gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that spurred the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, a period in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which officially ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development follows a path of its own, independent of cultural and political influences, and that, in turn, technology has its own “effects” on societies which are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically sustainable for just a few cars, so new manufacturing methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geography would emerge, which, in accordance with the place in society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so too was Constantinople considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned, bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was precisely at this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was completed.
Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, dressing was under strong influence of Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could be lagging by some 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest inventions of that era, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce enough food only for the needs of the farmer and their family.
Consumer agriculture is a simple, often organic system that utilizes saved seeds, locally sourced within a given ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected due to social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often signify their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to refer to some sad cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "brutal" or feral. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, such abandonment of children happens because parents refuse to accept the child's serious intellectual and physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma in childhood before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When fully raised by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behavior (within the limits of their physical capabilities) almost entirely similar to that of the animals who cared for them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, learning through a "scaffolding" system goes a step further.
Metacognitive scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support system that provides assistance to individuals as they navigate new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is actually a type of scaffolder, but so is a small paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are an integral part of the software and should review, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to implement on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it still happens.
We consider the foster care system a protective zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, ongoing education, and reliable healthcare.
Family foster care should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes they were previously taken from.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions regarding use and access to gratification.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are cited as important purposes for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Emey and McCord (1998) identified “personal involvement” and “maintained connections” as novel motivational aspects when researching public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that, if you accurately interpret microexpressions, you can detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work *The President’s Speech*, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even believes that such abilities in understanding human behavior might be possessed by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unhidden.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination contribute to the constant mixing of variations between two pools in each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive tract similar to humans struggles to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
Even if that isn't done, serious consequences could arise: an increase in depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
Plant resources that were easiest to access were the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting them if they aren’t cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
When everything is taken into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved with a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you to a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you reset the clock while sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which encourages a person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person’s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force there is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. By visualizing different deities, energetic channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to a falling out between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was planned to last 40 years, and the fight would be a real one, through conflicts of smaller countries representing the interests of larger military powers, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope lay in withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans quickly became obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and established Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of eastern territories of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Overseas shipping is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across the ocean.
The traditional role of the navy has been to ensure your country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while also preventing the enemy from transporting theirs.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and weaponry across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, was attempting to halt this traffic.
Had the Allies not succeeded, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by goat herders who were usually children or young people, similar to more well-known shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
Railway tracks for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling wagons to achieve greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Railway ties were introduced quite early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more effective if they had an iron bar on top.
This has become established practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the cart.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, rails made of solid iron were used for the first time.
The first known form of transport was walking. People began to walk upright 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as commonly believed.
Evidence of improved bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs even earlier, as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is like treating the symptoms. However, if we don’t want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Danlap's Pages."
John Nixon was the first to publicly read this document, on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th and read to his troops on July 9th in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Danlap lists still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original, which was handwritten, has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits in computer jargon.
It may not be immediately obvious that it is internal poisoning. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that a diagnosis cannot be made right away.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of open packaging of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label to see specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects very well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both bed bug killers and common bed bugs are species that remain with their parents for a long time, adapted to life in a nest or host's home.
Across the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged individuals.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to experience symptoms of MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples may decide to plan to adopt a baby.
Upon adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main task of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. This method actually governs most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only way, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observation also drive scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and particularly on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's conceptions of all scientific questions, including psychology, were highly regarded.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many prominent rhythms in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms that are not merely responses to the periodic change of external influences have been observed in the majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a period of free-running oscillation, even if there are no external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas, with the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the plant and animal life of the wilderness.
Field activities include, for example: hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural areas by car to get to their workplaces, passing those whose workplace is precisely where they just left.
In this dynamic transport process, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this high-carbon consumption economy has shifted the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are transport systems causing so many complaints and why do they make mistakes every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonable and consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, connections have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of facilities along the road.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily avoid enemies and more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them a wider selection of different small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years earlier, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many believed the opposite – that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This sounds reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its localized width of six miles.
I read that twenty percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids at Giza in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which by that time were already over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily mined using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, had a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or several of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This resembled more four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances, in order to form what we see.
Alloys are actually mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that consist of small amounts of nonmetals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods appeared, the pen was relegated to a lower status and used less frequently.
People now write messages on a computer screen, having never even been near a typesetter.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle of taking energy to assemble a core with many protons and neutrons.
It’s roughly like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Re-splitting the nucleus then releases a certain amount of energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
Thinner is under the lunar sea, and thicker under the hills.
Perhaps there are more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories are aimed at finding out what motivates people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized while maturing into adults.
These theories explore what it is about certain people that makes them want to do the things they do, and what aspects of their environment will compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two forms of behavior can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain “one of the guys” (or girls).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluation, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything they’ve done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the one responsible for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams should meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that local management wouldn’t understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
"The 'Invisible Team' is the management team to which every member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through a lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concept of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently within an organization’s functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the process of organization in which we work together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new, innovative process that will satisfy customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of productivity.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching cognitive abilities. This narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports the claims of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and material for creating simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI evokes a strong connotation with science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence encompasses creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and dispatching, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and for military purposes, given that they are integrated into several home computers and software applications for video games.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Often, the teacher would like to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual field trips. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Virtually sharing experiences from field trips is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are preserved online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critically-minded audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Additionally, blogging "forces students to become more resourceful regarding the world around them." The need to stimulate public interest inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to materials on the internet, students can define their own positions in the context of others’ texts, as well as express their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital city of Canada, and boasts a wide range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven of pristine natural beauty—Muskoka and beyond.
All of this further emphasizes Ontario as something that foreigners essentially consider to be Canadian.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that may surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is convincingly the largest island, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was widely adopted in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, starting when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to things they might consider harassment, and it’s not uncommon for them to be followed, have their hands grabbed, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was also used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and even the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Badi, and Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it’s all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east, near Rwanda.
Goma was destroyed in 2002 by a lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city’s streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside of Goma should be thoroughly investigated to understand the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu province.
This city is also a base from which ascents to the Nyiragongo volcano begin, along with some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a deprived city, although its reputation places it among tourist attractions, and it even has an airport.
Due to the threat of desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
That was one of the main locations for Henry Louis Gates Jr. during the filming of “Wonder of the African World” on PBS.
This city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic than African vibe.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located northeast of South Africa and along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park stretches across 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which contains diverse wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the premier attraction of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
We should also consider purchasing a Wild Card, which allows entry into certain South African parks or all of the national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and it’s a place many tourists consider the main focus.
The row of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering ribbon chart, which becomes apparent with the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To best see Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of the urban part of Hong Kong Island is densely built upon reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This place was taken by British colonizers as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list under UNESCO protection. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans stretches across an area of 3850 km², of which one-third is covered by aquatic/marshy surfaces.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
Buses depart from the intermunicipal bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakara/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
As intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese minivans, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to reach nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a bridge with a cable car. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the completion of customs checkpoints on the Brazilian side is expected.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Paiagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, previously known as the “Giant Province of the Indies”, was founded in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on clay courts in Las Cañitas.
You can also see smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
For all news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association (Asociación Argentina de Polo).
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FRF), the value of which is set equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley with credit cards, and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British and United States currency may be; check with owners in advance to determine which payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency off the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; temperatures above 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively mild: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combined create a feeling that it's much colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, and therefore they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Despite their tame appearance, bison, North American and European moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking strongly scented food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has officially held the title of capital of Samoa since 1959.
Luka was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships, except for one British cruiser, were sunk. Nearly two hundred American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Considering Oakland is expanding to two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas:
The beaches of the North Coast (in the area of North Luke) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most of them also have shade created by tamarisk trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are in Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, and with a rich array of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer, "Broj Jedan" (Number One), isn't a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that are good to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
Tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you’re concerned.
To Australians, the coffee “double espresso with milk” is a strange concept. A short black is “espresso”, cappuccinos are served heavily topped with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but exquisite.
Throughout the year, numerous trips to the reef are organized, and injuries resulting from any of the aforementioned reasons on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of the city of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of this timeframe.
There are sharks, however they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away from you.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance makes a traveler confident that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation through them, such as campsites.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, provided transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of flights and hotel arrangements.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to consider the offer, or they can obtain other documents you may need for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any supplement or request should first be sent to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most consider it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to come early to secure a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages has stopped, there might be parts of the festival where music is still playing late into the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic during winter, check the location of the cabin, as traveling through the ice causes quite terrifying sounds for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include the time spent in the city. Passengers on the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money visitors spend. Windows and clocks are generally absent, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay longer.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served on the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning a drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is poor and you can't drive as if you're on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stranded.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, as well as fog or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic generally flows without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is likely the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the experience for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term "safari" refers to overland journeys where you can see amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to slowly approach cars, so standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you’ll have a better view of them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "nature walk", "walking safari", or "walking tour") consists of hiking, which lasts for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from late March, most cancellation policies due to coronavirus were not in effect until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
The expected price for most event tickets will range from 2,500 to 130,000 Japanese yen, with the price of a typical ticket being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps damp clothes dry. Numerous hotels allow you to rent irons and ironing boards, even if you don't have them in your room.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are multiple ways to purify water, with some yielding better results against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters differ in efficiency, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying water from reputable companies in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter pests and animals they are unfamiliar with from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in a worse case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Highly contagious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes may sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it frequently passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
It's interesting, however, that the mobile phone network is much stronger here than along many other parts of the road, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds reserve.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are particularly rich and diverse, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular pastries often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try what is called a Berliner, Funkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be “dry” or “wet,” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Given that it encompasses 17,000 islands from which to choose, Indonesian food is a broad term encompassing a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, if used without further specification, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine encompasses a wide range of simply seasoned dishes, predominantly featuring aromas preferred by Javanese people such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the rider, but can pose a safety issue due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot remains caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse continues to run. To minimize this risk, a number of preventative measures can be taken.
First and foremost, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, saddles, especially English saddles, have safety features that allow the leather girth to fall away from the saddle if pulled by the rider during a fall.
Kochamo Valley – Chile’s main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
From the highest peaks, views unfold that take your breath away. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among the endless possibilities of Stara Planina mountain.
Snow mountain sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," plan entire vacations spent skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is exceptionally old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to as early as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed at least since the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in 1861 by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski mountaineering: This activity is also often called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is associated with, but typically doesn’t involve ski touring or alpine-style mountaineering; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover a slightly greater distance than by walking – but you will very rarely achieve the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean you would have to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
In that regard, the Schengen Area, however, functions similarly to a single state.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross borders without repeatedly going through passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply separately for visas for each of the Schengen member states, which saves time, money, and avoids paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define products older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, even if they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
Raising reindeer is important for the life of the Lapps, and culture within trade is also important for many who practice other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami were heavily dedicated to reindeer herding; instead, they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and reindeer were mainly used for pulling and carrying loads.
Today, many Laplanders are engaged in modern crafts. Tourism is a significant source of income in Lapland, a region located in the Lappish area.
Although common, especially outside the Roma community, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive as it evokes negative stereotypes and inaccurate conclusions about Roma people.
If the country you plan to visit becomes subject to travel advisories, it may impact your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You might also want to hear the advice of other countries' governments, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different scenarios than Europeans or Arabs.
Reports are merely brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The presented viewpoints are often superficial, general, and simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are different types that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and consequences of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks associated with bad weather in the area they are in, as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who wishes to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone must undergo professional training beforehand.
If you type "hostile environment course" into an internet search, you will likely get the address of a local company.
The course will typically cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, mainly with practical experience.
The course will typically last from 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Passengers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad must be checked to see if they are carrying valid return travel documents.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not state a person's gender (X) or documents updated to reflect a person's preferred name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies equally.
Security checks at checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are return flows from waves separating from the beach, often present on a reef or similar locations.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, and a fast current to deep water can form there.
Most fatalities occur due to exhaustion while attempting to swim upstream, which can be unachievable.
As soon as you're out of the current, swimming back isn't harder than it normally is.
Try to aim for somewhere you won’t be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been noticed, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock appears sooner than cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding with you, knowing that travelers in a new country must adjust.
People may not expect that returning travelers also need patience and understanding.
The show with sounds and lights in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things here for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx is presented as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
On the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, many nations lay claim and have the highest number of bases there, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau, and then reappear to form a 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Vinson reaching 4892 m.
In remote locations, without mobile phone signal coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone, because to make a call, you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used when traveling by boat, including yachts, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice capabilities.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and study.
This is particularly popular with those finishing school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can improve prospects for continuing higher education in one's home country.
Generally, there is tuition for enrolling in one of these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and on the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise very unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number ranges from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a few whole days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go to the coast as part of boat excursions, a special visa is not required (since 2009).
In brochures, Berlin, Germany is highlighted as part of some cruises. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they haven't flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes regarding other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works, and what happens during flight, can help them overcome fear based on the unknown or on the inability to control events.
Courier companies are well-paid for fast delivery of goods. Often, time is very critical when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own airplanes, but for others or for smaller firms, it was a problem.
If they sent the items by air freight, on some routes it was possible that it took days to clear unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send the luggage as checked baggage. Airline regulations won’t allow them to ship luggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come into the picture.
An obvious way to fly in first or business class is to part with a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, to persuade the company you work for to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more for a business class ticket than a standard economy fare, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in even asking for discounts on business class and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers willing to pay extra to have the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldavia is a multi-ethnic republic that suffered due to ethnic conflict.
This conflict in 1994 resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with around 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as a very good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and bustling trade center located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass walls, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional roofs of red tiles, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European than a traditional Turkish atmosphere.
The village of Haldarsvik offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some graves.
It's worth taking half an hour to walk around the intriguing village.
To the north and in close proximity lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron recorded the brilliant tale of its enchantments.
The express bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also, to the north, visit the Great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple), a place known worldwide for the apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please bear in mind that you are visiting a site of mass graves, as well as a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their stay here, and far more whose loved ones were killed or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the site by making markings or carving graffiti on objects.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and in fact, everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, given that it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and in other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced automatically in a large number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, unfriendly, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to be polite – like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-mannered). This will make navigating your way around much easier.
The rudeness of Parisians quickly disappears if you show a little basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts an exceptionally wide range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, differing soils, and diverse elevation levels.
This area is also home to an exceptionally large number of diverse animal and bird species.
Rare animal species can be found here, including brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats, and black grouse, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must have skirts below the knee and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide skirts for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own skirt, especially one with bright colors, you’ll elicit a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Following the same rule, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this from the stockroom at the entrance, but the clothing isn't washed after every wear, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. There’s a universal size for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and makes overall use of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is “pan amb oli”: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie," which represents "You" (formal), are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although the writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to determine whether a verb or an adverb is used in the form of a pronoun.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are "ц" and "г", as their pronunciation varies depending on the following consonant.
Also, make an effort to pronounce “r” and “rr” differently: “karo” means darling, while “karro” means carriage.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that if you speak a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are largely obsolete today, existing now as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution wasn't the problem it is today during their heyday, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, where they were more readily available than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossom viewing were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best when in their natural environment, so resist the urge to remove “even just one” specimen.
If you are visiting a formally maintained garden, collecting "samples" will also get you ejected, and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to visit and it is very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But considering it is located in the “high tropics” just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
A pair of buses goes north to Hebron, where the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives is located.
Check if the bus you plan to take goes directly to Hebron itself, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat ride along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night without sleep, in some open place in order to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possible that this spring and fertility ritual originated before the advent of Christianity.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, while communities often begin celebrations as soon as midnight strikes to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not travel, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience polar nights, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, considering the sky will be dark for most of the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, so you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal compared to what Westerners might be used to.
The attire was business formal, and colleagues address each other by surname or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to ask their superiors for approval for every decision they make, and they are also expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
