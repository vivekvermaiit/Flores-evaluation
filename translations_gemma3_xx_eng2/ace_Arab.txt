Here, in the context of "nuclear energy," "development" might be more appropriate, but "awakening" captures the sense of initiating or realizing its potential. * **"ݢڤتهى" (gepthat):** means stated or said. * The sentence structure is somewhat formal and typical of written Acehnese.

They likely represent small gifts or tokens. * **"Ureüng rumawi jaman geurasa seil mano’ kaleu kon" (ڠن هنا اورڠ روماوي جامن ݢراسا سئيل مانوء كلكون)** – This is the hardest part.

Here's the best translation I can provide, aiming for accuracy while acknowledging potential nuances: "That thing is difficult, making positive progress is like climbing a steep hill. No one can truly meet with absolute peace." **Explanation of choices and difficulties:** * **ماكين ديت چكڠ (Makin deuh ceukeng):** "Makin" means "that/it". "Deuh" is a particle adding emphasis. "Ceukeng" means difficult, troublesome, or complicated. * **ماكي ڤوسيتيف تݢر اوديب ڽڠ نا (Maki positif tegar udeep nyang na):** "Maki" means "making" or "to make". "Positif" (borrowed from Dutch/English) means positive. "Tegar" implies steadfastness, firmness, or resilience – here used metaphorically for effort. "Udeep" means steep, high, or arduous. "Nyang na" means "that is". The entire phrase paints a picture of making positive progress being *hard* work. * **تيڤ اورڠ نا ڤوتينسي ك متمو دامي ڠن ڤوس مطلق (Teup ureung na peutensi keu meutemu damai ngon pous mutlak):** "Teup" means "no". "Ureung" means person or people. "Na" is a particle. "Peutensi" means able to/capable of. "Keu" means "to/for". "Meutemu" means "to meet". "Damai" means peace. "Ngon" means "with". "Pous mutlak" means absolute peace. The sentence suggests the impossibility of achieving perfect peace. It's important to note that Acehnese, like many languages, can be highly contextual.

Here's the best translation I can provide, considering the nuances and likely intended meaning: “That’s a good arrival, German troops, may strength bring peace, strive so that the path becomes smooth and straight.” **Explanation of difficulties and choices:** * **بك (Bak):** Often means "good" or "well" in older Acehnese, used as an exclamation. * **واتو (Watu):** Means "arrival" or "coming." * **ڽڠ (Ng):** A common particle, often indicates a descriptive quality. * **تنترا (Tentara):** Means "troops" or "army." * **لاؤة (Laue):** An older form referring to "German". * **جرمان (Jerman):** German (modern spelling). * **ڤهون (Pheun):** "May" or "let it be." Indicates a wish or hope. * **جيڠوى (Jingui):** Strength, power. * **كاڤل (Kavel):** Peace. * **سلام (Salam):** Peace (often used in conjunction with *kavel* for emphasis). * **اوسها (Usha):** Strive, endeavor. * **ك (Ke):** "So that" or "to." * **ڤدوڠ (Pudong):** Becomes. * **لالو (Lalu):** Path, way. * **لينتس (Lintas):** Straight. * **ڽي (Ny):** Particle, often indicates a quality or state of being.

That's a difficult sentence with some archaic/regional Acehnese phrasing! Here's the best translation I can provide, aiming for accuracy and natural English: “It is said that long ago, there was a beautiful maiden – she was a guest who came from the dense forests, from the high lands, who was found in a wide, spacious cave.” **Explanation of challenges & choices:** * **"Oten jih neun"**: This translates to "It is said that..." or "They say..." indicating a story or legend. * **"Vie ken"**: "Beautiful/good" – combined with the context of a maiden, “beautiful” is a good fit. * **"bakaw sagal"**: "Maiden" or "young woman". * **"Neun d tamong ladom"**: "She was a guest". *Ladom* specifically indicates a guest or visitor. * **"dari rimba rimba kheueng tingga"**: "From the dense forests, from the high lands". The repetition of *rimba* emphasizes the depth of the forest. *Kheueng* means 'from', *tingga* indicates high elevation. * **"neun dileur d keuph taneuh luas gagintek"**: “Who was found in a wide, spacious cave”. *Dileur* means "found," *keuph* is "cave," *taneuh* is "land," *luas* is "wide," and *gagintek* further emphasizes spaciousness.
