This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also reveals details that fossils could not provide—such as color and a three-dimensional representation.
Scientists claim that this animal’s plumage was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis likely evolved much later than these other features.
Based on the structure of the feathers, it can be concluded that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for display. Researchers suggest that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage, not chick down.
Researchers have suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample demonstrates adult feathers rather than downy juvenile plumage.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb detonated near a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, resulting in the deaths of two police officers and injuries to over twenty others.

They concluded that the Sun functions on the same basic principles as other stars: as it turned out, the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to changes in its magnetic field.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but a program was created to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for will be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way influence the galaxy in Sagittarius.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a sort of halo and is made up of many small particles.

“Their thermal behavior isn’t as stable as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain almost constant temperatures, but it suggests these must be deep pits in the ground,” said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Science Center at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting traditionally does not involve the use of high technologies: voters enter the booth one by one and place a pre-printed ballot paper with their chosen candidate inside an envelope.
After election officials verify the voter’s identity, they drop their ballot into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
France's electoral law quite strictly encrypts the proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting, and no envelopes are added except those deposited by properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, adhering to specific procedures.

Four female sitting skiers were unable to finish their runs, and 45 out of all 117 skiers did not place in the super-G race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman, and returned her stolen mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are named Baba Kandjar, Bhutha Kandjar, Rampiro Kandjar, Gaza Kandjar, and Vishnu Kandjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were freeing the driver from a red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any witness testimony could be challenged as her photos were frequently published.
In other provinces of the UK this is common practice, but Scottish law operates differently, and courts have treated the publication of photographs as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are clearly taking a dangerous path by spreading photos and other data of suspects."
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, told reporters it would not provide any further comment, at least until an indictment is issued.
According to leaked information, this document will refer to the conflict surrounding the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics likely to be covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the maintenance of a military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
Hunters assisting in pest control needed to be carefully monitored by rangers, as hunting was being monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with the UNPZ and the Australian Shooting Association (ASSA), qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Association of Sports Shooters' hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation for the NSDP, four shooters selected for the initial culling operation have received appropriate safety briefings and training.
Yesterday Martelly took the oath in the new Temporary Electoral Council (TEC), which consists of nine members.
This is the fifth Temporary Electoral Council of Martelli in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous election commission as part of a package of measures intended to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to large-scale protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by failed elections, some of which had been delayed since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it is aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METP announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded, calling Apple's delay in reporting a "great regret."
An earthquake occurred in Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Homeland Security reported no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were successfully rescued. Currently, reports indicate the deaths of at least six hostages.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly lady, as she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He received training as an obstetrician-gynecologist and took a job at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the introduction of the hormone accelerates the embryonic development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, state investigators retrieved two flight recorders (black boxes).
Fellow soldiers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on a night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I was… maybe even more so… I love her and will miss her… hoping she’s in a better place."
Of the 1400 people surveyed, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008 to the 2010 federal election.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Elizabeth II.
34 percent of respondents agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Looking at those who gave definitive answers in the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and participate in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but doubts have arisen about his physical condition given his complaints.
He couldn't take pain medication, as it was prohibited during the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Some people confirmed the discovery using various gadgets and software before the beginning of February, and this was reported on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets were a source of water delivery to Earth, as well as organic substances capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, as comets have long collided with Earth.
53-year-old Cuomo became governor earlier this year and signed a bill into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and foolishness."
Rumor has it that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
She utilizes satellite technology, as opposed to the more outdated ground-based radar technology, enabling air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with maximum precision and provide pilots with detailed information.
No additional transport is being launched, and overland trains will not stop at Wembley, while car parking and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable at surface level.
Concerns about the lack of transportation led to consideration of holding the game behind closed doors, without team fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was previously thought that this process would take much longer due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortis*, and the cactus finch immigrant, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be given the most diverse forms. It can be curled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. An indicator can be created using juice from red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The acidity level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders by rotating them in a container, then knead them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, providing unusual sensations and forming something like a shell.
Toilets connected to a sophisticated drainage system were present in almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a signal and then almost immediately reflects it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts light and what we see.
A huge rocket at least 100 feet tall is needed to deliver a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel unbelievably changed the world. The greatest thing the wheel did for us was to make transportation significantly easier and faster.
It gave us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Below are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey – from rabbits to antelope and deer.
There are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that hunt numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of a niche – a special position that each cat occupies and that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult male relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely connected to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides largely behave like packs of wolves or dogs—animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and just as dangerous to their prey.
A tiger, as a well-rounded athlete, can climb (though not very skillfully), swim, jump long distances, and strike five times harder than a strong human.
Tigers belong to the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger’s roar doesn’t resemble the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather a confused series of vocalizations.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and stalk their prey by scent, searching for their smell on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding in their surroundings and then unexpectedly pouncing on it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to another island and thus cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new species will need to develop new traits or become a stronger competitor than it was before.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all – they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to look less and less like the original population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, meaning the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an extremely important component of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make food from sunlight using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we consume is plants.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on his palate, meaning that no one who crossed his path would escape.
We don’t know for sure, but perhaps he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly he was even a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex wouldn't be able to compare to him.
The Romans mostly ate foods familiar to us, but they also had their own strange and unusual banquet delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to hold communal banquets where they rested on their sides while eating.
Products brought to Europe from America or Asia centuries later could not have been part of the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling place of that god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods’ needs through ceremonies and festivals.
In every temple there was an open temple courtyard, and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids were built, which were parts of temples and were called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses weren't all that important.
Much of this Jewish family’s life was spent outdoors.
Women were cooking food in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street. Houses were built of stone.
In Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Old Norse sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is indeed something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence from July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document and is upside down.
There is no information about its author, however, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the document (it measures 29¾ by 24½ inches) was kept rolled up.
Thus, it is quite likely that the record was added simply as a tag.
As a result of the D-Day landings and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south remained free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy. These were Frenchmen who signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, and this landing was named "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, Americans and the forces of the "Fighting France" movement liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture of a significant group of people who live and work together, that is, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," meaning "civil," which relates to the Latin words "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state"—and this, in a way, also defines the size of a society.
City-states can be considered precursors to nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural legacy, and even distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence, and therefore are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the War for Independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government—Congress was its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the authority to levy taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state governments – which often did not cooperate – to enforce all of its acts.
He also lacked the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, and the states took central authority so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Such sports competitions as football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing are widely known.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 6th largest island country in the world! **(Note: The original Ukrainian stated 7th largest *island*, which is incorrect. Japan is the 6th largest *island country*. I've corrected this for accuracy in the translation.)**
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" due to the cluster/group of islands on which it is located.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European sailors, passing by, recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in southwestern Taiwan, beginning the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the perimeter of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic image format in the world is 35mm, which was the primary format at the end of the analog film era.
Today it is still in production, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by the formats of image sensors in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore considered 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APC family of formats) equal or are very close to this proportion.
A frequently used and parodied rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
According to it, the most effective location for the main object is at the intersection of lines dividing the raster into thirds vertically and horizontally (see Example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion held European states together, despite differences in languages and customs.
His ubiquitous power had an influence on everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should fight suffering and poverty, and church funds are intended precisely for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money led many to question whether the church truly adhered to this principle.
Shortly after the sudden outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective. Although the blockade violated generally accepted international legal norms codified in numerous international treaties of the past two centuries, it severed vital military and civilian supply routes.
Britain was extracting minerals in international waters to prevent ships from accessing certain areas of the ocean, creating danger even for neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing sentiments among most citizens and nations.
Having realized the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations strived to prevent such a thing from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Nikola Tesla moved to the United States of America to apply for a position at Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In Ancient China, different periods of time were depicted in a unique way—each stage of the country's development, or each ruling family that became a prominent dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was an age of unstable, divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Jin and Han dynasties.
During those times, fierce wars were taking place between many nobles, who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in the history of Ancient China – thousands of people died in battles for the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and also the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Additionally, after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all willing men, giving the most ambitious and talented the opportunity to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of army ranks based on class, they were now based on qualities.
The French Revolution also inspired many representatives of the oppressed working class in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave, known as "Hira," on Mount "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, provides a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, she's not easy to find at all, even if you know she exists. Once inside the cave, you will find yourself in complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains all around. A very small part of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many great pyramids built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Giza), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu’s wives and family members.
The “bow up” marking looks like the letter “V”, and the “bow down” marking resembles a bracket or a square without a bottom side.
Up means you should start from the frog and push the bow, while down means you should start at the heel (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Moving the bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while moving it downwards results in a stronger and more assertive tone.
Don't hesitate to add your own markings in pencil, but keep in mind that the printed markings for bowed instruments have a specific meaning, and should therefore usually be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market drove the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, from Versailles, forcing them to return to Paris.
In the carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a gang member waved the head of a royal guardsman killed in Versailles before the horrified queen.
The military expenditures of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial US regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses and interest on loans placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Excess profits from the prolonged exploitation of Filipinos would, of course, be the main achievement of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that spurred the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the Classical Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that actually encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the promotion of technology or a technological imperative to the idea that the fate of humanity is, in a strict sense, dictated by the fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology as such follows a path largely independent of cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has an “impact” on societies that is more inevitable than socially determined.
For example, someone might argue that a car necessarily leads to road construction.
However, a nationwide road network is economically impractical for a small number of vehicles, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road traffic accidents, which in turn drives the invention of new methods in healthcare for treating bodily injuries.
Romanticism carried a significant element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture arose connected to that geography, which, existing in harmony with society, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
He is known as the epicenter of luxury, its origins dating back to around 400 AD, and which lasted approximately until 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, his position deteriorated mainly because Crusaders returned with goods like silk and spices, which were valued more highly than in the markets of Byzantium.
It was precisely at that time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing of the people of the east was under strong influence of Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of that time was the adoption of buttons for fastening clothes, a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is agriculture aimed at growing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic system that utilizes saved seeds from local plants of a given ecoregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this still persists in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to gain a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be defined by the age, ethnicity, social class, place of residence, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct phenomenon can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often express their affiliation through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion items, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is to take several stories of unfortunate children who grew up in neglect, misery, or deliberate cruelty, and who were not socialized by adults.
Children like these are called "jungle children" or feral. They are often kept captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents abandon children to fend for themselves due to their inability to cope with the children's severe mental or physical disabilities.
It's possible that feral children were subjected to cruel treatment or suffered serious injuries before being abandoned or running away.
Some were reportedly raised by animals; it was said that others lived alone in the wild.
An uncivilized child raised by animals behaves almost identically (within their physical capabilities) to the animal caregivers, for example, treating people with fear or indifference.
And although design technologies are meant to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather assistance provided to individuals learning new material, such as a new computer program, or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher acts as scaffolding, just like the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds in software are designed to prompt, hint at, and explain procedures that might be difficult for students to learn on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide range of reasons, which can range from neglect to abuse and even violence.
No child should grow up in an environment deprived of care, attention, and upbringing, but they do.
We believe that the foster care system should be a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide everything they lacked in the home they were previously removed from.
The internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication tools.
Distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions from the perspective of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as significant motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they researched audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions – facial movements that last several milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to determine if a person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," pointed out that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately detect sincerity.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, might possess such abilities in interpreting human behavior.
A study conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genotypic variability: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alter variation between two pools with each generation.
For primates with a digestive system like that of humans, it is difficult to satisfy their amino acid needs through the available plant resources in the savanna.
Moreover, if this is not done, it will have serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest if not cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a significant amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking all of this into account, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved the “protein problem” in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberate awakening during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep within a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself repeatedly resetting the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other methods based on biorhythms involve drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is directly opposite to the level of tension in their body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of achieving enlightenment. The only thing that can hinder reaching this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was supplemented by the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Overall, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures caused these countries to fall out.
Two years had passed since the end of the war, and former allies had become enemies, leading to the beginning of the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and real battles took place between the armies of countries on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans lost their relevance almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after occupying eastern territories of Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the USSR and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to carry large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional task of naval forces has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously creating obstacles to your enemy’s ability to move theirs.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this is the campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans attempted to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, primarily using submarines, attempted to halt this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain just as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Home goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures, and were tended by goatherds, often children or teenagers, more commonly known as shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
The packhorse trail was built in England as early as the 16th century.
And although corduroy roads were, in essence, two parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses working on them to develop higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat more rutted conventional roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced to hold the rails in place quite early on. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more effective if an iron fastening were installed on top of them.
This became common practice, although iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails appeared.
The first known form of locomotion was walking; humans began to walk upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning 'upright man').
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as commonly believed.
Bipedalism is found in fossil remains of australopithecines dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have begun walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, join an environmental movement, and even become activists to at least somehow reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it’s just treating the symptoms. However, if we don’t aim for just a temporary solution, then it’s worth finding the root of the problems and eliminating them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly thanks to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have grown larger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
During the night, 150-200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon, in the yard of Independence Hall, on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
Currently, it is known that the 25 Dunlop posters are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has been lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives on to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
Their paws have scales and claws, they lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rexes.
In fact, all computers used today work by processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
In the binary numeral system, there can only be one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and, to use computer jargon, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not manifest immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to diagnose right away.
The first sign of poisoning could be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label for specific first aid recommendations for this particular poison.
From a formal point of view, entomologists describe this group of insects as beetles.
This term reflects centuries of familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects very well adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both conenose bugs and bed bugs are nesting insects adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged people, as well as younger individuals.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the risk of developing MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interests, or not in the best interests of their child.
Such parents may decide to create an adoption plan for their child.
Upon adoption, biological parents are deprived of their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover, using scientific methods, how the world works. This method truly guides most scientific research.
While this is not merely experimentation, an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and observation also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were recognized.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often strongly depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their functioning through a biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic factors, are found in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey–Chase experiment became one of the main pieces of evidence supporting the idea that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a multitude of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected portion of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna/wildlife.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
Another example is visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo, as well as learning new information about them.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns in their cars to get to their workplaces, while others pass them by who work in the places they just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth traffic flow, everyone is connected and supports the transportation system, which is based on private cars, in one way or another.
Now science recognizes that this large-scale carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone lives in society and uses transportation systems. Yet, almost everyone complains about them.
You don't often hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges in developed countries.
Why do transport systems receive so much criticism and fail daily? Perhaps transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is the problem something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is defined as the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult, as driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave quite consistently; thus, traffic flows largely have some logical sequence and can have an approximate mathematical model.
To better represent the traffic flow, a relationship was established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These ratios help in planning, designing, and ensuring the operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This opens up a wider range of small places where they can hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
More than a thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the entire Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed in his correctness, but many people believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, since we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching a width of 6 miles.
A full 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed either in size or in the technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the structures of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the country with the smallest population.
In its legislation and official communication, the Vatican uses the Italian language.
Italian is also the language of everyday communication for most people who work in the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of them can be found in nature in native form, and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more akin to four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, though he also hypothesized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are predominantly a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that include non-metallic elements, such as carbon in small quantities.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of these particles could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, after its appearance, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods emerged, the status and use of the pencil declined.
People now write messages on a computer screen, without needing to go near a pencil sharpener.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like when something newer is invented.
An atomic bomb works on the principle of taking energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy wagon uphill. Nuclear fission once again releases part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with a small nudge or none at all.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The upper layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The lunar crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
He is thinner beneath the lunar seas and thicker beneath the highlands.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas because the crust is thinner there. Lava found it easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what makes people tick or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have adopted during the process of growing up.
These theories encompass specific individuals and what motivates them to want the things they do, and what factors in their environment encourage or discourage them from doing certain things.
Two popular and substantive theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Overall, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to manage their former colleagues. On one hand, they try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable personality who feels compelled to change everything the team has done and do it their own way.
Ultimately, the leader bears full responsibility for the team’s success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtually created teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as points of contact with their immediate real-world group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet across time zones, which can be unclear to their local managers.
The presence of a genuine "invisible college" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The "Invisible Team" is a management group to which all members report. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of becoming a learning organization? One goal of implementing the concepts of organizational learning in practice could be innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across an organization’s functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result of the collaborative process of overcoming obstacles, the organization may develop a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
"Angel" (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities. Thus, they narrow the search area and make it more precise.
Researchers in their studies are supported by the correlation between pathology in the brain and behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand processes in our consciousness.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
During research in the field of AI, machines are compelled to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and design, the ability to respond to customer assessments and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and faces.
Such things have become distinct disciplines focused on solving real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the armed forces, as they have been integrated into several applications related to home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of any class. Often, the teacher would like to visit places with students that are inaccessible by bus.
Technologies offer solutions with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts or admire beautiful art while sitting together with their class.
A virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital every year; the website is redesigned each year, but its older versions are preserved online as an archive.
Blogs can also help improve a student’s writing skills. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers begin to try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "encourages students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy audience interest motivates students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to study diligently outside of the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can inspire students to become more analytical and critical; actively responding to materials from the internet, students can define their positions in the context of others’ articles, as well as outline their own viewpoints on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
In Ottawa, a beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada, there are a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada’s history and modernity.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north – the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and areas beyond.
All these and other things emphasize in Ontario what outsiders consider the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that might surprise many: the USA has more African Americans than Canada has citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest, and is a continent in and of itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it took strong root in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, this region borders the Sahel region, and in the south and west – with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: all traveling women are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It would also be advisable to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what you might consider harassment, and it’s not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Firmly reject men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, this is not normal!).
The present-day city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese completely destroyed it and then rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but after the earthquake in 1755 they abandoned it.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt a city called Dar al-Badia, and Spanish merchants who established trading bases here gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of knick-knacks, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the extreme east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyragongo volcano, which buried most of the city’s streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, it is necessary to assess the situation with ongoing fighting in North Kivu province before any travel outside of it.
This city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyragongo volcano, and for one of the cheapest gorilla trekking experiences in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Because of this, and also due to the relative inaccessibility, the name "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although it has an airport and attracts tourists with its history.
In 1990, it was included in the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the most important stops during Henry Louis Gates’ PBS series *Wonder of the African World* reportage.
The city sharply contrasts with other cities in the country, as it has more Arab flavor than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which harbors diverse wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, visitors are charged a daily fee for conservation and entry.
For some, it may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to certain parks in South Africa or all National Parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that attracts the attention of many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the architectural face of Hong Kong has been compared to a gleaming histogram, revealed by the presence of waters in Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon side, opposite the harbor.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island’s urban development is densely situated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place that was appropriated by British colonists, so if you’re looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past – this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world’s largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the inland districts of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not simply mangrove swamps, as they include some of the last remaining strongholds of the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², about a third of which is covered by water or marshland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that it currently harbors 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days before your trip.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and durable.
A minibus is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150) and Punakha (200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the banks of the Oyapock River and the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The pylons are 83 meters high, and the bridge is 378 meters long. It has two lanes for vehicular traffic, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it wasn’t opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully opened in September 2017, once the Brazilian customs posts are completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, occasionally practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycuru and Paiagua, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was created as a result of clashes between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous peoples, previously known as the "Giant Province of the Indians."
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a significant part of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year as well.
Contact the Argentine Polo Association for news regarding tournaments and ticket sales for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the "FIC West" store.
British pounds are usually accepted anywhere in the islands, and many establishments also accept Stanley cards and US dollars.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although they may take British or US currency; check with the owners in advance to determine what acceptable payment methods are.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it has summer while the Northern Hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively mild: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't any distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are used to people, wild animals are still wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park regulations, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so bring and do not cook fragrant food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor became the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the murder of Tupou Tamasēse Lealof III, the paramount chief.
There are many beaches due to Oakland's location between two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly, sometimes crowded beaches with plenty of shops along the coast. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer, "Number One," is simple but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
You can taste many French wines, but New Zealand or Australian wines may withstand transportation better.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, however, if you are concerned, bottled water is readily available.
The concept of a "flat white" coffee is unfamiliar to Australians. A short black is an "espresso," cappuccinos are made with a mound of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. And the fruit juices aren't cheap at all, but they are wonderful.
Many trips to the reef occur year-round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay particular attention to hazard warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river lagoons from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be seen in other months as well.
Sharks do indeed exist, however they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don’t spend much time in the ocean; their primary natural habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler a peaceful certainty that they will have somewhere to stay as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often cooperate with specific hotels, although you can try to book alternative accommodations with them, such as camping.
Travel agents typically offer packages of services that include breakfast, organization of transfers to/from the airport, or even combined packages of flights and hotels.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your trip (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should still go through the travel agency first, rather than directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a significant majority of music event attendees choose to stay overnight on site, and for most attendees, this is an important part of the adventure.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll have to come early to get a spot closer to the stage.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages has stopped playing, there may be sections at the festival that will play music late into the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of your cabin, as traveling through ice creates a rather terrifying sound if you are close to its source.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos generally put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and inside the premises.
Some establishments offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication negatively impacts one's ability to assess situations, so all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low, and you are not allowed to drive as if on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck in it.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by the formation of water or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without disruption year-round.
Safari is arguably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, drawing the attention of many visitors.
The term "safari" in common usage refers to a journey overland to admire the incredible African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closely, so the standard equipment will allow you to get a good look at them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be timid, and it’s best to observe them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or a "foot safari") is a walk lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the tournaments will be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but by the end of March, most cancellation policies due to coronavirus had not been extended to July 2020 – the time the Olympic Games were scheduled for.
Most tickets for the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets priced around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for rent, even if they are not available in your room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, a scorch mark).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filter effectiveness varies. If you are experiencing problems, you should consider purchasing water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they have never heard of in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person, are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in designated locations.
Travelers who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on goods such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, as it frequently runs through remote, heavily forested wilderness.
If you are unfamiliar with country roads, keep in mind: they are characterized by steep slopes, narrow paths, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is extremely important to adhere to them.
Interestingly, however, cell service is much better here than on many other stretches of the route, for example, in the "Pennsylvania Wilds."
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are particularly rich and varied, similar to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are quite common: apples are used in baking all year round, while cherries and plums are used in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular pies will often be especially delicious with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but delicious pastry, try what is called a "Berliner," "Pfannkuchen," or "Krapfen" depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Cari (a type of porridge) can be “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally added to curry; in South India and sometimes in other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is traditionally added.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, if used without further clarification, this term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now very popular throughout the archipelago and offers a wide selection of simply seasoned dishes, with peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices being the predominant flavors.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can be dangerous due to the potential for the rider's foot to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, the horse may run and drag them. To reduce the risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety features whereby the stirrup with the strap will fall from the saddle if the falling rider pulls it with them.
Kochamo Valley, with its diverse granite high ascents and cliffs, is a prime rock climbing destination in Chile, also known as the Yosemite of South America.
Ascents include admiring breathtaking views from the summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes amidst the endless potential of the walls.
Skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport involving descending a snow-covered slope on skis or a snowboard that are attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities, engaging many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skis is very ancient – cave paintings dating back to 5000 BC depict skiers!
Skiing as a sport originated no later than the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: this activity is also called ski touring, ski mountaineering, or ski trekking.
This is related, but typically doesn’t include backcountry skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is done on steep slopes and requires the use of more rigid skis and boots.
Consider a ski route similar to a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to travel significantly further than on foot – but rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with a large number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean repeatedly going through visa procedures and passport control.
However, the Schengen Area, in this sense, functions as if it were one country.
By remaining in this zone, you can generally cross borders without repeatedly going through passport control.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to obtain visas separately for each of the countries within the Schengen Area, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies characterize goods over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition varies depending on geographic location – the age limit in North America, for example, may be lower than in Europe.
Craft items can be considered antiques, even though they are newer than comparable mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important to many with other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, usually keeping reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern commerce. Tourism in Sápmi, where the Sámi live, generates significant income.
Although the word "tsigan" (gypsy) is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and a false perception of these people.
If the country you are planning to visit becomes subject to government travel advisories, it may affect your travel medical insurance and cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult with the governments of other countries besides your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Information bulletins provide only brief information about the political situation in the country.
The presented data is often superficial, generalized, and highly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that could potentially cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they come in various types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are types and consequences of bad weather, just as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to find out about the risks of unfavorable weather conditions in their area, as they may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
Searching online for a "Hostile Environment" course will likely yield the address of a local company.
As a rule, all the issues discussed here are covered in much more detail in the course, usually with practical sessions.
Typically, the course lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid training, and sometimes live-fire exercises.
Books and magazines about surviving in the desert are common, but publications about war zones are scarce.
Tourists planning gender affirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender designation (X) or documents updated to reflect a preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to consider such documents also varies greatly.
Searches at border crossings also became more thorough in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender individuals who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are backwash from breaking waves, often occurring near reefs or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in several deeper areas, and a fast current into the deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while attempting to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will be no harder than usual.
Try to move to where you won’t be caught in the current again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been spotted, it might be better to wait for rescue.
Return shock occurs earlier than culture shock (even before the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Those travelers who didn't have trouble adapting to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are already adapted to a new culture and have lost certain habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, because they knew that travelers needed to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are just as necessary for travelers when returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most exciting events for children in this area.
You will be able to see the pyramids in the darkness, and you will be able to see them in the silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and merchants. A history of sound and light is like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx serves as a background setting and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are reflected on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by several countries, have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, there’s Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano forms the basis of an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a territory in the south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains converge here into a plateau, and then rise again, forming the 360-kilometer Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains of Antarctica: the Vinson Massif and Vinson Peak, reaching a height of 4892 m.
In remote areas with no mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is frequently used on vessels, including pleasure boats and expeditions, that require remote data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider should provide more information about connecting to this service.
Traveling and studying are becoming an increasingly popular option for those planning a leave of absence from university.
This practice is particularly popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a year off without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, studying abroad during a gap year can genuinely improve your chances of getting into a university in your home country.
Typically, such educational programs are paid.
Finland is a wonderful place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also encompasses thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, considering there’s a boat for every seven to eight people.
It compares to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is overall a rather unique phenomenon (for example, the figure in the Netherlands is one in forty).
Most of these notable Baltic Sea cruises feature a prolonged stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can spend several full days in a historical location, returning to the ship for the night.
When you go ashore only on ship excursions, you don't need a separate visa (valid as of 2009).
Berlin, Germany is included in the brochures of some cruises. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Traveling by plane can be a harrowing experience for people of any age and background, especially if they haven't flown before or have experienced traumatic events.
There’s nothing to be ashamed of in this: it’s no different from personal fears or disgust towards other things, which many people experience.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome fear, which is often rooted in ignorance or a lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for fast delivery of goods. Most often, time is very important when it comes to delivering business documents, goods, or parts for urgent repairs.
On certain routes, larger companies have their own planes, but in the case of other routes, smaller firms have faced a problem.
If they shipped things by air, clearing customs and unloading on some routes would take several days.
The only way to do this quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don’t allow sending baggage without a passenger, and here’s your solution.
To fly in first or business class, it's obvious you need to shell out a hefty sum for that privilege (or, even better, get your company to pay for it).
However, it's not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay four times more for business class than the standard economy class fare, and eleven times more than for first class!
Generally, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay the maximum amount for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and therefore charge accordingly for it.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling business and commercial center, located around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled houses, an 18th-century bazaar, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere more closely resembles Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Galdorsvik, there is a view of the neighboring island of Esturoy, and it also contains an unusual octagonal church.
Interesting marble sculptures of doves are installed over some graves in the churchyard.
It’s worth taking at least a half-hour walk through this intriguing village.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and captivating town of Sintra, which became widely known to foreigners after Lord Byron wrote an enthusiastic account of its splendor.
You can regularly reach Sintra by Scotturb bus 403, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the large Fatima Sanctuary (Brothers of the Temple), a site of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are, in essence, visiting a mass burial site, as well as a place of immense significance to a large part of the world’s population.
There are still many living men and women who survived imprisonment here, and even more whose loved ones were killed or worked to death here, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with dignity, solemnity, and the respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the area by applying markings or graffiti to structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the subway are made only in Catalan, while the automatic system reports unplanned disruptions in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known as self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Overall, it’s nothing more than a false stereotype, but the best way to fit in in Paris is to behave as impeccably as possible, like a person of “good breeding” (good manners). This will significantly simplify your trip.
The Parisians’ harshness will quickly disappear if you show a little common respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, pine and fir, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts an exceptional diversity of plant life thanks to its varied microclimates and soil types, as well as changing altitudes.
This area is also home to an exceptionally wide variety of animal and bird species.
Here you can encounter rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and black grouse, as well as many other well-known species.
When visiting monasteries, women should wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls to women who arrive unprepared, but if you come with your own, especially in bright colors, you’ll receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
They can also be borrowed from the storage near the entrance, however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may find it unpleasant to wear them. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple, popular supper, especially in summer, is Pa Amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, and so on.
All nouns, alongside the word Sie meaning "you," always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and nouns.
Perhaps this also makes it easier to read, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced the same way they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are "с" and "g", as their pronunciation differs depending on the following vowels.
Also, be sure to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: *caro* means dear, while *carro* means chariot.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly correct grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people with a basic knowledge of Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is quite similar to it and doesn’t need to be studied separately.
Today, old observatories are generally obsolete and function as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem during their heyday as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for scientific research are massive facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Contemplating cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the plum blossom was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing celebrations were held by the emperor in the Imperial Palace, exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to destroy even "just one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formally maintained garden, collecting "samples" will also result in expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe and easy-to-navigate place where you can buy practically anything upon arrival.
But, being in the “high tropics” just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll have to deal with both the heat (always) and the scorching sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also several buses that run north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Please check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a wonderful idea for a vacation.
Let's say, visit the castles in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube River, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also map routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday were also adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night sleepless in some open place, in order to see the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could quite possibly be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold Easter services on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and believers frequently begin celebrations at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got here either by water or by air.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
After humans arrived on the Galápagos Islands, many mammals appeared there, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a wonderful opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what residents of Western countries are accustomed to.
The standard business attire is suits. Employees address each other by last name or job title.
A prominent place is given to harmony in the work environment, with group effort being valued above individual achievements.
Employees often need to obtain their manager’s approval for any decisions, and are also expected to follow managers’ instructions unquestioningly.
