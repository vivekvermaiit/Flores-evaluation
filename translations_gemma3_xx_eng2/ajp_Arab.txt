Even though a single experimental vaccine appears able to reduce mortality from Ebola, currently, there are no drugs definitively proven to be suitable for treating existing infections.
A single antibiotic cocktail, Zymab, initially showed promise in the field, but official studies said its benefit is less than what’s needed to prevent death.
In the بالم experiment, zimab was like a control element, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the message of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and acknowledges the imperative need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all athletes, following us.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of athletes and clubs—our athletes and their sport—can be better served by moving forward with a change in meaning within our organization, rather than revoking the license.

This doesn't just confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers – a widely circulated theory – but it provides details that fossils generally can’t, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists said that this animal’s feathers were chestnut brown on top with pale or carrot-colored underparts.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers didn't have a fully developed rachis—the central shaft—but possessed other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers have concluded that the rachis likely evolved gradually after these other characteristics.
The feather structure suggests they weren't used for flying, but rather for regulating body temperature or display. Researchers proposed that despite this tail belonging to a small dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of a large animal, not juvenile feathers.
Researchers have suggested that, despite this being the bone of a small dinosaur, the sample shows fully grown feathers and not juvenile plumage.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate feedback on observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team’s finding was that its cause is the tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy.
Just like the moon affects the clouds on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also has a strong effect on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to determine that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy exists around the galaxy in the form of a halo, and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new form was "very worrying and disturbing due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the bacteria in the hospital, Dr. Mowl believes, and at least two of them were healthcare workers at the hospital.
Within one year, an infected person can transmit the virus to 10 to 15 people close to them.
Despite this, the XDR-TB rate among the entire group of people with TB still appears low; 6,000 out of 330,000 were detected at any given moment in South Africa.

In France, traditional voting was a low-tech experience where voters would isolate themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed paper indicating their preferred candidate into an empty envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures precisely.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there were no ballots inside at the start of voting and that no ballots other than those of authorized, registered voters have been added.
The candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the electoral process. And at night, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The Oka weapon failed when it was pointing at the head of the fifth man. Schneider suffered from constant pain, blindness in one eye, and lost part of his skull; his face was rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider testified via a video link from the American airbase in his homeland.
After the Arbaa event, Karbanedo competed in two races alone in the championship.
His first obstacle course race was the Zigzag Race, and at that time he won the "Not Finished Yet" award in his first round. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
And in a second race, the Giant Slalom, I took tenth place in the women's sitting class with a combined run time of approximately 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Lösch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth place finisher Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female figure skaters in the ladies' short program failed to finish their routines, and 45 out of a total of 117 female skaters failed to rank in the giant slalom race.
The Madhyia police returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General, Dr. Arya, said: “We arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop.”
We dedicate these successes to Baba Kangar, Butho Kangar, Rembro Kangar, Gaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
The police commissioner, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
Despite all that, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident happened was closed for a short while while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
We transferred him first to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
They then moved him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
And from that time on, she became known as Deaconess in the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh, charged with the murder of her son.
She’s detained awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness testimony might be compromised because her picture has spread widely.
It’s common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts considered that publishing the images could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes “that a journalist seems to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, and so on, of suspects.”
The Royal Court, which is responsible for legal proceedings, stated to journalists that no further comment will be made until the indictment is issued, at least.
The document, according to the leak, will indicate a dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Middle East war in 1967.
And among the other topics that were reportedly covered, were the future state of the holy city of Jerusalem for both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, contingent upon the Palestinian Authority agreeing to allow this presence for only five years once an agreement is signed.
The archers in the supplemental pest control trial were closely supervised by forest rangers, and the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated there.
In partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial cull received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
I swore in Martilly yesterday at a new temporary electoral council (CEC) of nine members.
And it is Martelly's fifth CEP test in four years.
And a presidential committee recommended last month the resignation of the previous temporary electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee reported on Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Violent protests began, at times, due to the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as early as 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheating have been reported in malfunctioning iPod devices, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by describing Apple’s postponement of the report as “truly regrettable.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The emergency management office in North Mariana Islands stated that there are no damages reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held two tourists from Hong Kong hostage and hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with an M16 rifle.
We rescued a good number of hostages and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
We were able to release six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as the Filipino journalists.
After that, they took the photographers to a secluded spot because she needed to use the restroom. Then they went to Mendoza.
Layounz followed in his father’s footsteps and worked in the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Legions started investigating premature births during his free time.
The result of his research is that if we give the hormone, it will accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators located two flight recorders from the "black box" on Wednesday.
The wrestlers are colleagues; Luna praised them a lot.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin “Golddust” Rhoades commented, saying, “Luna was as terrifying as me… maybe even more so… I loved her and will miss her… I hope she’s in a better place.”
Among 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believes Australia needs to become a republic before the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of poll respondents share this opinion, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The last thing we could imagine is that 29 percent of those surveyed say Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
They were scheduled to have the one with the Olympic gold medal compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming races, and in three races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaint, his fitness became questionable.
He couldn't get the necessary medication to overcome his pain, so they were prevented from participating in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using various devices and software by the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets might be a source for delivering water to Earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists wish they understood how planets form, especially how Earth formed, when comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Como, 53 years old, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
We expect him to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system, they say the Federal Aviation Administration believes, that will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
You are using a technology that relies on satellites instead of the old technology based on ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and give pilots more precise information.
There are no additional transport services operating and trains will not stop above ground at Wembley, and park and ride facilities are not available on site.
The public’s fear of limited transportation increased the possibility of forcing the match to be played behind closed doors without the team’s fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, despite the belief that this process takes much longer, due to interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch and the common cactus-finch, Geospiza scandens, and the migrant large cactus-finch, Geospiza conirostris.
We can make different shapes from gold, and it can be rolled into small forms.
It could be drawn into thin wires, which might be twisted and coiled. It could be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhere to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of the chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on whether the chemical substance is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is the quantity of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry powders together, then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will interact with the outer layers, and this creates a strange sensation and forms a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a well-organized bathroom in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
They discovered remains of sewage networks in the cities of Minwan in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you’re using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back immediately, right away.
They launched the satellite into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
This task requires a rocket that's enormous, exceeding 100 feet in height, to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel provided is a means of transportation that is easier and faster.
She brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Underneath, there are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Ultimately, there are many cats (including loose feral/stray cats) that eat more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success lies in the concept of status, which is a unique role for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Harems consist of one to three adult males, along with up to thirty females and young.
Women are usually close to each other, because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions behave with a great deal of pride much like packs of wolves or dogs, and animals remarkably resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a well-rounded athlete, can climb (though not skillfully), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times its weight.
The tiger is in the same group (tiger genus) as lions, leopards, and tiger cats. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar isn't like the lion's full-bodied roar, but it resembles a sentence made of chronic, shouting words.
I love cheetahs; they eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the cheetah hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that tapeworms find and locate animals to feed on (prey) through smell, and by sensing their location on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very stealthily. The ocelot hunts its prey by blending in with its surroundings, then pounces on it.
When a small group of organisms (a small number of individuals) becomes separated from the main population they originated from – such as if they migrate across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island they can no longer easily return from – they will most likely find themselves in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new residents will need different features or adjustments to be strong competitors than what they needed before.
The original inhabitants haven't changed at all, and they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, they start to appear less and less distinct from the rest of the population.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be completely different and we won’t be able to call them the same species.
We call this process diversification, and its only purpose is to create new kinds. Diversification is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans release (meaning, exhale).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis, and also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we make our utensils from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals wouldn’t be able to stay alive.
Mosasaurus was the strongest predator of its time, so it wasn’t afraid of anything, except other Mosasaurs.
Its long teeth are studded with more than 70 sharp points, in addition to another set with a finished roof, and this means there’s no escaping anything in its path.
We're not sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
And also, it attacked everything that enters the water—even the giant dinosaur like the T. rex had no match for it.
At a time when most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans have strange or unusual festive elements, namely wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the zaghba.
The other difference was that when the poor and women would eat their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men wanted to host feasts with each other and would recline on their sides when eating their meals.
It didn’t include the ancient Roman meals, nor the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
So, for example, they didn’t have any corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and not even an ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god’s dwelling.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the gods’ needs through celebrations and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and then an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, they built special towers in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special place for the god.
With the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn’t very important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life became spent outdoors.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were merely open counters facing the street. And they used stone to build the houses.
There weren’t large forests in the land of Canaan, that’s why wood was very expensive.
Greenland has settled down a bit. In Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on a charge of murder, and when he travelled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there at that time.
Despite the fact that each country was “Scandinavian,” there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’re watching National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
And yet, this isn't right. Despite there being something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence advertisement. The text is under the document, upside down.
And at a time when no one knew exactly who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large manuscript document (measuring 29 inches x 24 inches) was enveloped for storage.
Therefore, it's possible they simply added the coding as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the following battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south remained unfree.
He was ruled by the French "Vichy" regime. These are the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragon First".
Within just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a shared individual culture among a large group of people who live and work collaboratively, as a society.
The word “civilization” comes from the Latin word *civilis*, which means “civil,” and is related to the Latin *civis*, meaning “citizen,” and *civitas*, meaning “city” or “city-state,” and this also defines, in a certain way, the size of a society.
Countries or cities are the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture is the transfer of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence of their connection, and they fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a central government for the first time – and Congress was its only component, divinely inspired – according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress initially lacked the authority to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the states’ authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all of its actions.
And also, she doesn’t have the authority to override tax and tariff laws between states.
The documents required unanimous approval from all states before being amended, and the states largely disregarded the central government to the point that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of approximately 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the fragmented/complex nature of the Japanese islands, people often refer to Japan, from a geographical perspective, as "a single archipelago."
Taiwan began in the fifteenth century when European sailors recorded the island's name as Isla Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to alter original grain production practices, employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar farms.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which they ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu contains three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
They rebuilt most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
When 1976 came around, we had restored thirty percent of Machu Picchu, and the restoration process continues to this day.
As an example, the common photographic format for still images worldwide is 35mm, which was the prevalent film size at the end of the analog film era.
And to this day, they are still producing it, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
A 35mm shape is actually quite confusing, it’s 36mm wide and 24mm high.
That’s why they say the aspect ratio for this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many established formats (like APS formats, for example) equal or closely approximate the aspect ratio we were talking about.
The foundational triangulation they use is flawed, and that which they usually mock, is simply a guiding principle that creates dynamics and maintains some order in the image.
The rule says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (look at this example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity linked the European countries to each other despite differences in language and customs.
Her comprehensive power influenced everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the fundamental Christian principles is that we must use wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church’s monetary funds exist precisely for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the central authority was subordinate to the Church in Rome, and this thing – that power and wealth were with them – raised questions for many about whether they genuinely adhered to this principle.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved successful, as it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although this siege violated generally accepted international law and what has been codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering large parts of the ocean, and this thing poses a danger even to neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different time periods; each stage of China or each dynasty in power was a distinct dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty there was a period of instability for the divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During those periods, a fierce war erupted between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most bloody eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying while sitting on the highest seat in the Grand Palace in Xian.
There were many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, professions were open to all young applicants, and this allowed the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
This same thing applies to the army, because instead of army classifications being based on class, they now rely on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many second-generation oppressed working-class people in other countries to begin their revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond worldly life. He would go to a cave known as “Hiraa’” on Mount “Noor” – meaning (light) – to meditate there.
The cave itself, which managed to endure until this time, provides a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.
The cave is located on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Seriously speaking, it’s not easy to find, even if someone knows it exists. Because once you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
You can’t see anything but the beautiful clear sky above and a few surrounding mountains. Very few people can see this from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that is still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, which the Egyptians built in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "City of the Dead of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes many pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
The "upper arc" mark is like the letter V, and the "lower arc" mark is like a basic element or a square missing its bottom side.
Higher means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and lower means you should start from the frog (so you hold your hand on the bow) and pull the bow.
Typically, the upper bow produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more assertive.
Don't hesitate to mark your own phrasing with a pencil, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so you must respect them.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, age 11, and Louis Charles, age four), and the King’s sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles due to a large group of market women.
In Arabic, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by groups of people shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A group of people forced the king and queen to fully open their car windows.
And once, one of the audience members waved at the head of one of the royal guards who was killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the expenses for the American imperialist war in the invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through banks on Wall Street.
And of course, the large profits gained from the long exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute fundamental gains for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to their creation.
The period in which these events took place is what they call the High Middle Ages, and it's a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came before the Early Middle Ages, and after it came the Late Middle Ages, all of which are generally agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a broad range of ideas, from the impetus or necessity of technology to the strict sense that the fate of humanity is driven by a fundamental logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism generally share two ideas: that the development of technology itself takes a course that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has “unifying effects” on established societies, rather than being socially conditioned.
So, for example, someone might say that cars necessitate the development of roads.
And yet, the national road network proved economically unviable with a small number of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership increases the rate of road accidents, which leads to the innovation of new technologies in the healthcare field to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to this geography emerged—and these were, in harmony with the place of the community, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame began when it was a center of prosperity around 400 AD and continued for about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, and this is fundamentally due to the return of the Crusaders bringing gifts like silk and spices whose value was higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
And yet, due to the slowness of communication channels, trends in the West can be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
As the end of the Middle Ages approached, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the type of farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, and is mostly organic, utilizing original, locally-adapted seeds within the ecological region, in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers used to practice subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
It brings together subcultures among individuals with similar thinking and those who have felt neglected by societal norms, and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to age, ethnicity, class, location and/or the gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture could be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Generally, they show members of a subculture their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashions, behaviors, and arguments.
One common approach used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on a small number of unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse, did not have adults socialize with them properly during their development.
They call these children "feral" or "wild." Some of the children are abandoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment is due to parents rejecting a child’s severe mental or physical disability.
It’s possible that feral children suffered child abuse or severe trauma before they wandered off or ran away.
They claim that animals evolved from snakes; they say some of them used to live in the wild on their own.
When raised among non-human animals, the feral child will exhibit behaviors (within physical limitations) that closely resemble those of the animals they were raised with, such as fear of humans or indifference towards them.
Between what is necessary is that he make project-based learning easier and more engaging, so scaffolding goes beyond that.
Scaffolding isn’t a way of learning, but a support mechanism that provides assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, like using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding could be both virtual and real, and in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, and also like the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
We understand that Virtual Scaffolds in the program aim to pose questions and request information within them, and to explain procedures that might be difficult for a student to handle alone.
They place children in alternative care for many diverse reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
Kids aren’t growing up properly these days in environments that don’t nurture or raise them, or teach them anything, they’re just…ending up like this.
We know that the daycare is a safe place for these children.
The adoption care system should provide safe homes, caring and affectionate caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
We are supposed to provide foster care with all the necessities those homes were providing for them before we took them.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead us to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to usage and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” were proposed as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
And Eighmey and McCord (1998) also added “personal involvement” and “relationship continuation” as new motivations when they conducted a study on public reactions to websites.
Using video recording allowed us to discover important things in interpreting subtle expressions and facial movements that last for fractions of a second.
Specifically, people say that one can discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks clarified in his paper “The President’s Speech” how people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage can nevertheless assess truthfulness accurately.
He even suggests that abilities like these, in explaining human behavior, might be shared by animals like pet dogs.
Research in the twentieth century clarified that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation added a new genetic diversity, and its identification will be removed from the expressed variation pool.
The process of disassembly and reassembly swaps the difference back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
Living in the savannah is difficult for large animals with digestive systems like humans to find their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
And also, failure in such things has bad consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources are the proteins obtainable from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) aren’t just difficult to digest, but they also provide a high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything we took into account, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "first protein problem" to some extent in the same way chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the deliberate act of waking during your normal sleep period and returning to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
We can easily do this using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself repeatedly resetting the alarm while still asleep, you might put it on the other side of the room, so it forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
The alternative options based on the biological system include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less tension there is, the more the positivity of life force increases. Every person has the ability to find peace and complete contentment.
Everyone is capable of achieving enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism relies on the teachings of the Buddha, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and many methods from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is divine yoga. By visualizing the different deities, you cleanse the energy channels and activate the chakras, and enlightened awareness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, ideologies, and cultures led to the outbreak of the Cold War.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies have become enemies now, and a cold war has begun.
It was supposed to last for 40 years and be a real fight, waged through proxy armies, across battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had completely collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
And yet, these plans became outdated almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is considered the most effective way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of naval forces has been to ensure your country’s ability to transport its people and goods, and at the same time, to intercept the enemy’s ability to do the same.
One of the new examples we need to pay attention to was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, was trying to stop the movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany most likely would have been able to invade Britain just as it did with the rest of Europe.
It's clear that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began preserving it for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or secondary grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were frequently children or teenagers, like the grazing system known today. And still, these grazing methods are used even now.
They built wagonways in England early in the sixteenth century.
Even though the carriages were just parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speeds and pull heavier loads than those that walked on the more rugged roads of the time.
They brought the crossties quite early to secure the tracks in place. Gradually, however, they realized the tracks would be more efficient if there was a piece of iron on top.
It became a common practice, but the iron caused corrosion to the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron ones. And in 1767, they built the first complete railways.
The first form of transportation humankind knew was walking; people began walking upright around two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning ‘upright man’).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, didn’t usually walk upright.
We found bipedal specializations in Australopithecus excavations from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the coast could have walked on two legs from seven million years ago.
We can’t start living in a more environmentally friendly way, and we can’t join the environmental movement, and we can’t even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don’t want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems, and we need to eliminate them.
It’s abundantly clear that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and problems have grown larger due to population increase and humanity’s extravagant lifestyle.
After its approval by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent several buildings away to the print shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, they produced approximately between 150 and 200 copies, now known as the "Dunlop Borders".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Square on July 8th.
They sent a copy to George Washington on July 6th, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlop reports that still exist are the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original handwritten copy is not available.
Many paleontologists today are saying that a single group of dinosaurs lived and is still living today, and that group is birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are a lot of things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have two men with measurements and claws, and they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today rely on processing information encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary digit can hold a unit value of only two values, meaning 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits – or bits – for use in computer language.
It's possible the internal poisoning is severe. The symptoms, like vomiting, are general, so we can’t make an immediate diagnosis.
We can’t consider the best indicator of poisoning to be an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label and pay attention to it to get specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to the group of insects.
This term is derived from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, insects that have highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are obligate parasites, adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
The couple might decide it’s not in their best interest, or in the child’s best interest, to raise him.
These couples might choose to establish an adoption plan for their children.
In adoption, birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that their partners can raise the child.
The main goal of science is that we understand how the world works through the scientific method. It’s the method most researchers learn to conduct scientific work.
But it’s not just about her, it’s an experience, and an experience is a test we use to eliminate one or more potential hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations, just like in scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle’s viewpoints were accepted regarding all scientific matters, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Typically, many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior rely on the existence of internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
We recorded cyclical rhythms, which aren’t merely responses to periodic external signals, for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue for a period of free-running cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA was the genetic material.
Use Hershey and Chase's phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to distinguish DNA in bacteriophages using radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur-labeled protein.
Mutations can have a diverse range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts the attention of people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting orangutans, photographing them, and learning about them in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns by car to go to their workplaces, and they see others whose destination is the place they just left.
With this dynamic, back-and-forth transportation, everyone is connected in some way to a transportation system that relies on and supports private cars.
Science is now saying that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
You rarely hear in developed countries levels of complaints similar to those about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems operate the way complaints are, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Do transportation engineers not understand? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is a difficult thing because you can’t predict drivers’ behavior with 100% certainty.
Luckily, drivers usually behave within a reasonably orderly range; therefore, traffic flows usually have a reasonable degree of consistency and can be approximately represented by mathematical equations.
To better represent traffic flow, we established relationships between the three key properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings a second time along the length of their body.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can’t fold their wings are dragonfly and mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many people believed the opposite—that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel like the ground is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water carried by the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that’s poured from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the fact that they continued to build pyramids with stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and artistic excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians during the New Kingdom period were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and has the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a daily language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is mostly used in religious celebrations.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times; we can discover them all in nature in their original form, and they are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also posited that it transforms into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are fundamentally a mixture of one or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are minerals. Of course, there are also minerals like silver and gold.
You can also get spikes that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit within the period at the end of this sentence.
And like that, the pencil was a good companion to many people when they took it out [to use it].
Unfortunately, when new ways of writing emerged, they neglected the pencil, diminishing its status and uses.
People now write letters on computer screens, without needing a pencil sharpener.
One can only ask themselves how the keyboard will be when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle of taking energy to combine the nucleus with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Re-splitting the nucleus again releases a little of that energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with a little push or without any push at all.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. They call the outer layer of the moon the crust.
The crustal thickness is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
He's thin under Maria and thicker under the highlands.
It’s possible there’s a Maria increase on the near side because the crust is thin. It was easy for the magma to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on researching what makes people like or engage with content.
These theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that develop as they grow into adolescence.
These theories explore some people and what makes them want to do the things they do, and what things in their environment led them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories for content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. One side of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
Managers of this type struggle with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, determining accountability, and holding people responsible.
On the other side of the spectrum, the person transforms into someone we can’t recognize and feels they need to change everything the team was doing, making it all their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team’s success or failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Team members in the virtual team often act as a point of contact for their direct physical groups.
They generally enjoy greater independence than traditional team members – meaning their teams can be assembled across different time zones, which their local management might not understand.
The existence of a real “single, invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of the virtual team.
The team “The Invisible” is a management team where each member reports to it. The Invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why does it need an organization to go through a process that takes a long time to establish an educational organization? One of the goals of applying organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When the use of all available resources is made effective through functional departments within any organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result of this, the organization’s collaborative process to overcome this obstacle could lead to a new, innovative process to meet the client’s needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method they use to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Providing neural data offers physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating cognition. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It’s been long known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some cognitive functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes with our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence has a strong connotation with science fiction, artificial intelligence constitutes a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The research includes AI-based machine manufacturing for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate specializations, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
They are currently often using artificial intelligence systems in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and they’ve also built a lot of computer software applications and home video games.
School trips are a big part of any class. Often, the teacher likes to take her students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy fine arts while remaining seated with their class.
Considering participation in a field trip is almost a sweet way to reflect on the trip and become an exchange of experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website design every year about their trip to the state capital, and they update the website design each year, but they keep the old versions online as a kind of yearbook.
It’s possible that blogs can also help improve students’ writing. Often, students start their blogs with poor grammar and spelling, so having an audience generally changes that.
And because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become smarter about the world around them." The need to nurture public interest makes students intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to expand the scope of learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “can make students more analytical and critical; through effective engagement with online materials, students can identify their position in relation to others’ writings and also define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital and it includes a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Down in the far south, at Niagara Falls, and up north, the homeland of natural beauty that isn’t being utilized – Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more shed light on Ontario as what many consider the quintessential Canadian “other.”
Large areas in the north have a low population density, and some are almost uninhabited.
Let's compare the populations—this will surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most small islands are independent states, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Just as the Arabs brought Islam to the region, it also greatly influenced Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the fifteenth century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Coastal Region to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
The woman: It is advisable for any female traveler to say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It’s also helpful to wear a ring (not a ring that looks *too* expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment, and it’s not uncommon to be followed or grabbed by the arm, and so on.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don’t be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but they abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it Dar al-Badia, and it became known as Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
In every corner of the Old City, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather products, shisha pipes, and a whole range of giggaw tools, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed most of the city’s streets, especially the city center.
Even though Goma is relatively safe, we still need to look for any visits outside of Goma to understand the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also considered a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and one of the cheapest places to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use “boda boda” (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Because they couldn't reach it, "Timbuktu" started being used as a passage to far-off, exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation attracting tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was featured as one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s PBS series *Wonder of the African World*.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country’s cities, as it is characterized by a more Arab character than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The area of the park is 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each zone having different wildlife.
It’s one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered one of the most prominent national parks in South Africa (Sanparks).
Just like we do with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily maintenance and entrance fees for the park.
It might also be useful to buy a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all of the national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong the region its name, and it’s the place many tourists consider the main hub.
The procession of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline was like a plan resembling a shimmering ribbon, visible through the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront across the harbor.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonizers built as a special area for themselves, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the region’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
We can say that the Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending for 80 km (50 miles) into the remote areas of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Declare Sundarbans as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But forests aren’t just mangrove swamps—they hold some of the last remaining vestiges of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, roughly a third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and currently there are approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave the station between areas (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since inter-city buses are usually crowded, it’s a good idea to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by comfortable and durable small Japanese coaster buses.
Service taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Baro (number 150) and Bunakha (no. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The towers rise to a height of 83 meters, with a length of 378 meters, and have two passageways each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
They decided that this bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, once they finish with the Brazilian customs inspection points.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is currently known as eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to secondary groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Paiagua, who lived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay was born—previously known as the "Giant Province of the Andes Islands"—as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three hundred years.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year happens in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be watched here at other times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and find out where to buy polo match tickets, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged at a one-to-one value with the British pound (GBP).
You can withdraw money from the only bank in the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FAC West store.
They accept the British pound anywhere in the islands, and they also accept credit cards from Stanley and the US dollar often.
They might not accept credit cards on remote islands, even though they take British and American currency; therefore, you should ask the owners before you go to determine the accepted payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your pounds before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there is when it’s winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions. Therefore, in the summer months, temperatures are above +30 degrees Celsius.
The winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There aren’t really “rainy” and “dry” seasons: the amount of rain stays pretty much the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the zoo are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and it’s forbidden to feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities’ instructions, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how docile they seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and pretty much all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don’t keep a safe distance. These animals are large and wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition to that, you need to know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odors and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and its population is just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the site of naval clashes with a bad reputation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British warship. Nearly 200 people, Americans and Germans among them, perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by Mao's movement, a peaceful gathering was held in the city, ultimately leading to the assassination of Supreme Leader Tupou Tamasisi Lilovili III.
In many beaches, due to the overlap between two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, swimming is safe there, and most of them offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that get crowded sometimes, with a good selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," and it’s not a complex beer, but it’s enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There’s a lot of French wine one can drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines might transport you better.
The local tap water is perfectly fine to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you’re worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black is an "espresso", cappuccino comes with a high pile of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent despite their high price.
There are many trips to the coral reefs throughout the six [months/period], and injuries resulting from any of these causes from the coral reefs are rare.
And yet, seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. And sometimes we can find them outside of these times.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don’t actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind, knowing they’ll have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Usually, travel agents have deals with specific hotels, even though you might find bookings for other types of accommodation, like campsites, through the travel agent as well.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or sort out other documents for your trip (like a visa).
Despite that, you need to review any changes or requests through the travel agent first, not directly with the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to come early to get a campsite near the music.
Keep this in mind even though the music at the main venues might be over, some parts of the festival might continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals include dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, make sure of the cabin's location, as walking across the ice due to a large commotion from the most affected people is dangerous.
The cruise trips to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually put in a lot of effort to increase the time and money customers spend. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and it's difficult to find an exit.
They usually have food and drinks, and special entertainment shows, to keep the visitors in a good mood and encourage them to stay inside the building.
Some places serve alcoholic drinks during gambling. However, alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes needs to consider the possibility of snowfall, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there's little friction and you can't drive like you're on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, a sufficient amount of snow can fall and trap you very quickly.
Visibility may be limited due to snowfall, blowing snow, condensation, or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, they consider icy and snowy conditions normal in many countries, and traffic usually continues without interruption throughout the year.
Safari trips might be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important thing for many visitors.
The commonly used term "safari trips" refers to overland travel to observe the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars a lot, and the standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "pay-to-walk," or "long-distance walking safaris," or going "on foot") consists of hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021, and some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but starting late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies were no longer extended beyond July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, and typical tickets will cost around 7,000 yen.
Using an iron on damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for guests to borrow, even if there’s no one available to operate them in the room.
If the iron isn’t available, or if you don’t feel like wearing ironed clothes, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Pay attention to the fabric, don't let it overheat (which could cause it to shrink or even burn in extreme cases).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, and in other areas it needs several minutes.
Filters differ in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers might encounter animal pests unfamiliar to them from their original regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, cause allergies, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people—those aren’t usually described as plagues.
The duty-free shop is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and fees at specific locations.
Travelers heading to countries that impose high taxes at times can save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is considered the most challenging driving condition on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike, as it frequently passes through isolated, forested terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on rural roads, use your head: most of the way is steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than they used to be in the sections before and after – usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/hour) – and strict adherence to them is more important than anything else.
It’s strange that the mobile service is much stronger here than in many other stretches of the road, like for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very delicious, and those in Bavaria are very rich and diverse, like those found in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are well-known; they cook apples in pastries throughout the year, and cherries and peaches appear in the summer.
A lot of German baked goods are also characterized by containing almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of nuts. Traditional cakes generally go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small, filled pastries, try what they call Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish that relies on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, the use of yogurt in curry is widespread; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent, the use of coconut milk is widespread.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a large collection of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if we use it without the terminology, the term tends to mean eating originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of simple dishes, and the dominant flavors—thanks to which the Javanese are known—are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are like supports for a horseman’s feet, allowing him to dismount on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider, but there might be safety concerns related to the possibility of the rider's legs getting stuck in it.
If a rider falls off a horse and their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, they might be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce these risks, some safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, knights used to wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, tight sole.
After that, some saddles have safety bars that allow the rider’s leather to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a fallen rider.
Wadi Koushamo – Chile’s premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, boasting a diverse range of walls and large granite formations.
The peaks there have breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes between its endless walls.
Snow sports on slopes, which include skiing and snowboarding, are well-known sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is considered a major activity for travel with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The history of skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing, or ski touring, is also known as ski mountaineering, off-piste skiing, or snowshoeing/hiking on snow.
He’s involved in it, but usually ski trips don’t include things like Alpine mountains or mountain climbing, because the latter is done on very steep terrain and requires more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a path that resembles hiking.
With good conditions, you’ll be able to cover greater distances than walking – but it’s rare you’ll achieve speeds where you can cross the country without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains a lot of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across different countries means having to go through visa requirements and passport control many times.
And yet, the Schengen Area is almost like one country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this region, generally you can cross the borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
And similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you don’t need to apply for visas to each member state of the Schengen area separately, thus saving time, costs, and paperwork.
There isn’t a comprehensive definition for manufactured items considered antiques. Some tax agencies say goods older than 100 years are considered antiques.
The definition includes geographical variations, meaning the age limit might be shorter in places like North America than it is in Europe.
Could we define handmade products as artifacts, even though they are smaller than similar mass-produced goods?
Reindeer herding is considered an important livelihood among the Sami people, and the culture related to trade is also important for many other professions.
And even from a traditional standpoint, despite that, not all Semitic peoples widely raised reindeer, and they lived off fishing and hunting and things like that, and most of their livelihood came from reindeer.
Many Sami people are working hard today on the new project. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is largely considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
It's preferable you go back to the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might encounter situations different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
The consultations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The opinions presented are often fleeting, general, and overly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous climatic phenomenon that can cause serious damage, social disruption, or loss of human life.
Harsh weather can happen anywhere in the world, and in different forms, which can depend on geography, terrain, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, cold temperatures, heavy rains, and wildfires are all forms and effects of severe weather, like thunderstorms, hurricanes, whirlpools, and tornadoes.
It includes regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena such as snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
We strongly advise travelers to be aware of any risks posed by severe weather phenomena that affect their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Everyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone needs to get professional training.
Could you possibly find a web search for "hostile environment awareness training" that returns a local company address?
The course usually covers all the issues we discussed here in much greater detail, and this is usually based on practical experience.
The course duration is usually from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about wildlife conservation are widespread, but publications that discuss war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning to undergo gender confirmation surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid travel documents for their return trip.
Governments differ in their willingness to issue passports or update documents to reflect a desired name and gender, with gender not specified (X).
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies widely.
And searches at security checkpoints became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals should not be expected to go through scanners before surgery to maintain their privacy and dignity.
Tides are the back-and-forth flow of waves that break on the shore, usually near coral reefs or something like them.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper sections, and a strong deep-water current can form there.
Most deaths happen as a result of the exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming backwards isn’t harder than usual.
Try to target a place where they won’t catch you again, or rely on your skills, and if you are noticed, you might need to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock hits sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon period is shorter), it lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Sometimes, travelers who easily adapt to a new culture experience a particular difficulty readapting to their original culture.
When you return to the homeland after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your customs from your homeland’s culture.
When I first traveled abroad, people were likely more patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
It’s possible people don’t expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning to their homeland.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most exciting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them silently before the show begins.
Usually, there’s always the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and light is like the story of a book.
They appointed Abu al-Hol (the Sphinx) as a background and narrator for a long story.
They project the scenes onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by more than one country and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active units in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. Its largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
And among the other places is Livingston Island, and Deception Island, which was flooded by the caldera of a volcano that is still active and gave us a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains, which are 360 km long, and the Minnesota Glacier river runs through them.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with a peak elevation of approximately 4892 meters on Vinson Mountain.
In remote locations, without mobile coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Satellite phones are generally not considered a replacement for mobile phones, because you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
They frequently use the service via satellite, including pleasure boats, and also exploratory trips that require remote data and audio.
You need to have a phone service provider who can provide more information about connecting to this service.
The most popular option for people planning a long annual vacation is to travel and learn.
This thing is particularly popular among school dropouts, allowing them to spend a year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, registering for a training course abroad for a year can improve your chances of returning to higher education in your country.
Usually, there are tuition fees to register for these educational programs.
Finland is a lovely place for boats. “The Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In the archipelago and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
Despite the fact that the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland; a boat can accommodate seven or eight people.
He’s done this in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in a different way – he’s completely unique (like in the Netherlands, for example, where the numbering goes from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises feature a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for two full days, including the return trip and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you go to the beach only using cruise excursions, you won't need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Occasionally, Berlin, Germany appears in the brochures for these cruises. As you saw on the map above, Berlin isn’t near the sea and a visit to the city isn’t included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven’t traveled before or have experienced a traumatic incident.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s not different from personal fears and dislikes that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how planes work and what happens during a flight helps overcome the fear that stems from the unknown or lack of control.
They pay well to courier companies to deliver things quickly. Very often, time is very important with paperwork, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
In some ways, large companies have their own planes, but there was a problem for the other methods and smaller companies.
If you ship items by air freight, it will take a few days for clearance and customs procedures.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow sending baggage without a passenger, which will be coming to you.
The clear way to travel first or business class is to pay a large sum to get privileges (or even better than that, have your company handle it for you).
In any case, this isn’t cheap: as a rough general rule, you can expect to pay approximately four times the normal economy fare for labor, and 11 times for first class!
Generally speaking, there’s no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Do you know that airlines are aware there’s a specific core group of travelers who are willing to pay large sums to get the privilege of fast and comfortable access, and they pay fees for this?
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is used more widely.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the Transnistrian Republic, which unilaterally declared independence in eastern Moldova, and which has its own government and currency, but isn’t recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have returned between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, and the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
It used to be the ancient city of Smyrna, and now it’s a bustling, modern and developed commercial center, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and new shopping centers with traditional red-tiled roofs spread throughout, alongside the 18th-century souk, ancient mosques, and churches, although the city’s atmosphere is more reminiscent of the Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
In the church square, eye-catching marble carvings depict a dove slightly above the graves.
Taking a stroll around the beautiful village is worth half an hour.
To the north and easily accessible, there lies the romantic and magnificent city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron recorded a glowing account of its beauty.
I regularly take the Scotturb bus 403 to Sintra, and it stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the Great Shrine of Sayyida Fatima (mausoleum), a place of Marian apparitions known throughout the world.
Please remember that you are scheduled to visit the mass grave site, in addition to a site of such meaning that its impact is almost immeasurable for a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived that time, and many others who had loved ones killed or who kept working until they died – Jews and non-Jews alike.
I wish you would treat the site with all the dignity, respect, and honor it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by putting markings or scratching writing on the walls of the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of them prefer to speak Catalan, and the majority understand it, while almost everyone knows Spanish.
And yet, most of the signs are in Catalan simply because it’s legally defined as an official primary language.
And yet, they also use Spanish widely on public transportation and in other facilities.
They advertise regular services on the metro only in Catalan, but they announce unplanned disruptions using an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be selfish, rude, and arrogant.
The thing is, this is usually just a stereotype that isn’t accurate, so the best way to navigate Paris is to be on your best behavior and act like someone “well-bred” (well-raised). It will make things much easier.
The Parisians’ sudden external designs will evaporate quickly if some basic courtesies are offered.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests, mainly of beech, fir, and spruce trees, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a large and diverse collection of plant communities, due to the range of local climates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
The region is also home to a very diverse group of animals and birds.
You might find rare animals like the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, alongside many common species.
When visiting the monasteries, they ask women to wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it’s brightly colored, you’ll likely get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, they are asking men to wear pants that cover the knees.
You can also borrow it from the storage room by the entrance, but they don’t wash these clothes after every use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing them. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of other regions similar to it in the Mediterranean, relies on bread, vegetables, and meats (especially pork), and they use olive oil in everything.
A simple, popular supper, especially in summer, is usually: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings like cheese, tuna, and other things.
You always start all names, alongside the word “Sie” for you, with a capital letter, even mid-sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and things.
We can also say that it makes reading easier, despite the fact that writing is complicated because we need to know whether the verb or adjective is being used locally/contextually.
Pronunciation is easy in Italian because they pronounce most words the way they are written, connecting the letters.
The main letters we need to pay attention to are seen and jeem, because their pronunciation differs based on the vowel that follows them.
Make sure to also pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, but carro means cart.
Persian is characterized by relatively easy and mostly regular grammatical rules.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
And without exaggerating, if you know a Romance language, it will be easy for you to learn Portuguese.
And yet, some people who know a little Spanish can deduce that Portuguese is very close and doesn’t need to be studied separately.
Typically, observatories built before the modern era are outdated today, and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn’t at its peak like the problem it is today, it usually existed in cities and universities, and it’s easier to reach them than the ones they built in the modern era.
Most new search telescopes are massive facilities in remote areas with suitable weather conditions.
Seeing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
This concept originated in China, and plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were hosted by the Emperor with other members of the aristocratic class around the Imperial Court.
Plants are at their best when they’re in a natural environment, so try to stop yourself from taking any plants, even if it’s “just one.”
If you’re visiting a formally maintained garden, they’ll take a “unit sample” and likely kick you out, no discussion.
Singapore is generally considered a very safe place and easy to get around, and you can buy anything you need after you arrive.
Just being in a "high tropical zone"—a few degrees north of the equator—means you’ll have to deal with intense heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're thinking of taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a nice place to base a holiday around.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to enjoyable cities on the Danube River, or riding boats along the Erie Canal.
They also designate well-known hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, and they celebrate the birth of Christ in it.
Many traditions related to the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There's a tradition to spend Easter night awake in some open places to watch the sunrise.
Surely there are Christian theological interpretations of this tradition, but it could be spring and fertility rituals pre-dating Christianity.
Traditionally, churches often hold Easter Vigil services on Saturday night during the Easter holiday, and worshippers often come to celebrate at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally reached the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, mammals couldn't make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the North Pole or areas of Antarctica in winter, you’ll experience the polar night, meaning the sun won’t rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be darker for more or less 24 hours a day.
Because the areas have few inhabitants, and for that reason, light pollution isn't considered a big problem often, you’ll also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard work attire, and coworkers address each other by their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is very important, because it emphasizes collective effort instead of praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to get approval from their bosses for any decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their bosses’ instructions without questioning them.
