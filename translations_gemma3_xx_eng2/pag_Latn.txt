I will test the pH of the chemical. We can make an indicator using boiled red cabbage.
The color of repolyo (cabbage) juice changes depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level indicates the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in a chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that are released when electrons are lost (In other words, Hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).

Lions are social animals that hunt in large groups called prides.
The pride is complete with one to three chickens that are roasted whole. With them are the various dishes and also with their condiments.
The women are close to each other, being part of a big family with their husbands and female children as well.
The male lions are also similar in appearance to tigers or cats, as are the lionesses (but different, like the large cats), in behavior, they are always fierce to those they encounter.
Like a trained athlete, the tiger can run (but not for long), swim, and jump a great distance, and can also be as strong as a healthy, robust person.
The tiger is like the group (Genus Panthera) of lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four-legged cats are known for their roar.
The tiger's offspring are beautiful and seem strong enough to survive, but they can still get sick for a long time.
Ocelots like to eat spiny anteaters. They prefer the shells, heads, tails, and feet if they can get them. Everything that an ocelot leaves behind is tastier than what it eats.
Scientists thought that ocelots are (prey) victims through poisoning, they are wondering what their weakness is in the wild.
They saw a lion yesterday and they were able to escape quickly. Similarly, ocelots prey on their victims by hunting in the forest and those they prey on are often left suffering from the wounds inflicted upon them.
Those small groups (small populations) of people who lived in very remote places have moved to larger groups (settlements), (like in populated areas or rivers or on small islands where it is difficult to reach where they originated), and can no longer return to their original places as before.
Because the rich no longer have any way to spend their money and have nothing bad to do, the rich group will create ways for them to adapt and to surpass what they used to do.

During the harvest season, the strong group usually competes with other groups in finding places to eat various foods.
That’s about the time it’s been a long time ago, or even before that year, that group went to different places continuously and wasn’t disturbed, unlike nowadays.
We call that tradition, and in its simplest form, it is the legacy of two classes. Tradition is early knowledge and an important result and part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen for humans to breathe, and humans exhale carbon dioxide for plants to use.
Plants produce their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also release oxygen.
We will plant vegetables and also raise livestock. All our food comes from plants. If there are no plants, the animals will die.
The Mosasaurus was the strongest of all creatures in its time. Despite being fearsome, it wasn’t just like other mosasaurs.
He’s already 70, with failing teeth, so his jaw aches, and he goes with his companions from other groups to the highest part of the hill, so no matter what trouble he encounters, he doesn’t easily give up.
We weren't sure, but it seemed his tongue was already used to it. Among his foods were turtle, large fish, various shellfish, and he also ate things similar to those.
He is afraid of even a small mosquito; even a large dinosaur like a T. Rex cannot fight him.
We are familiar with the many foods of the Romans, but there are some that are unique or not commonly served unless there is a feast, such as roasted pig, peacock, snails, and a kind of rodent called a dormouse.
One of the differences is that the poor eat fish and pigs, but the rich men like to have parties and are present on the side just to eat.
Unlike the food of the Romans of old, the food in Europe that came from America or from Asia differed in the centuries that followed.
Because there is nothing to plant, there are no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and there is no Roman noodle soup for the turkey to know about.
The people of Babylon built temples for each of their gods and used them as dwelling places for the gods.
The people sing hymns to their gods, and the priests offer them to the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Every temple has a porch and inside it has a sanctuary where only the priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes, there was nothing to build except to become part of a temple, special towers like pyramids called ziggurats.
This house of worship is a special sanctuary for God.
Because the climate is hot in the Middle East, shade is not important.
The families of the righteous in Hebrew return to dust.

But even with the discovery, the Eskimo tribes still live in the same way as before.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences among the people, namely, the customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
Watch the movie National Treasure, because you’ll realize there’s a treasure map hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that’s not it. It’s true there’s nothing written on the back of the document, but it’s not a treasure map.
In the body of the Declaration of Independence, there is written "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". Some of the words in the text of the document are reversed.
Even though there is no certainty about who wrote it, it is known from the writing itself that the large document on parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was folded for safekeeping.
Therefore, it was only noted as a label.
The D-Day landing and the subsequent battles were crucial in northern France, but they did not achieve their objectives immediately.
The leader was Vichy French. The French didn’t think about the Germans in 1940, instead they helped them rather than fight.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the north of France and it was called "Operation Dragoon".
The Americans and the Free French forces liberated France after two invasions, and then advanced into Germany.
Civilization is the coming together of people with a culture to cooperate in a society.
The word civilization comes from Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city, which also refers to the entirety of society.
Culture, a part of civilization, is passed on to each individual, for that is what defines generations.
Minor cultures are easily lost because there is no established important historical evidence and are not recorded in civilization's history.
Under the Articles of Confederation, the Revolutionary War led to the formation of thirteen states with a weak central government—with its only legislative body being the Congress.
Congress has no power to impose taxes, and because there is no functioning executive or judiciary in the country, it only depends on the authority of the states, which do not cooperate in applying the law.
The authority also has the power to impose tax laws and collection in the states.
The articles concern a single permit needed from all states before a state can begin and if a state is late in complying, the central government has the authority to pursue them with delays.
The national football team of Italy, along with the German national football team, are two of the most successful teams in the world and champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.

Winter sports are popular in the Northern Region, including Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has 7,000 islands, the 7th largest in the world!
They call Japan an "archipelago" because its islands are grouped or exist as a cluster.
In the 15th century, Taiwan began to be noticed, and European ships started to dock on that island, called Ilha Formosa, a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in Taiwan with sugar plantations and employed Chinese workers.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the Taiwan coastal area and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, and the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
That building, which was previously damaged, has been repaired again so that tourists can see it.
In 1976, forty percent of Machu Picchu was damaged, and restoration efforts continue to this day.
The standard size for photography is 35mm, the same size as analog film.
He/She still uses that now, but the aspect ratio is more important to it than the digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm one isn't reliable, the 36mm is for distance and the 24mm is for close-up.
The aspect ratio of this format is 3:2.
Most formats (like the APS format) are adjusted to the ratio.
Let's analyze the image size to understand its dynamics.
The effective way to request an image is to click on it so its size is remembered.
In this work begun in Europe, the Catholic Church, which became wealthy and powerful, was investigated.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united the governments of Europe despite their different languages and customs.
The powerful impact of this will affect everyone from the rich to the common person.
One of the teachings of the Christian faith is to use wealth to lessen greed, and fortunes disappear because of this reason.
The source of authority of the church is in Rome, within the confines of thousands of years, and this source of power and money is questioned by many if its principles are truly being practiced.
After the First World War, Britain occupied Germany.
The blockade was effective, military assistance was cut off and the delivery of supplies was delayed, although the attack was not sanctioned by law, many countries still expressed sympathy.
Britain declared international sea lanes for ships to avoid being within all sections of the sea, as even neutral ships are exposed to danger.
Because of the limitations of countermeasures against that tactic, Germany increasingly resorted to unrestricted submarine warfare.
The flapper lifestyle and revelry were the habits of people in the 1920s.
The horrors and devastation of World War I are still remembered and recounted by people today.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He told the US that he had 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (a former manager at his job) for Thomas Edison.
China has no history of a unified period; each family has its own dynasty.
Each dynasty has three provinces. This refers to the Three Kingdoms period within 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During that period of time, the wealthy were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was a time when many people died in ancient China, because of the intense competition for the throne in the Xian palace.
The effect, politically and socially, is nationalism, believing that the nation is a structure of people, not just a single ruler.
After the Revolution, ambitious and courageous men were the first to seek employment.
They will choose the best soldiers through their categories.
The French Revolution inspired other countries to stage revolutions as well.
Muhammad is interested in life as it is a worldly life for him. He often goes to a cave called "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" to meditate.
They made that a cave, a place beloved for its spiritual shelter.
That's not how you usually greet someone going to Mecca; that cave is where you should pray.
It's pleasant to drink and reminisce with you. Truly, a treasure is hidden within the cave.
You won't see anything beautiful among the weeds and grasses.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is among the seven wonders.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians for the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), small caves, small temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The pyramid of Khufu and the pyramids, temples, and tombs were built for Khufu's wife and family members.
The "up bow" is like V, and the "down bow mark" is like a bent shape.
Start by placing your hand on the tip of the bow, release the bow, start with the frog and pull the bow.
The up-bow has a soft sound, the down-bow is strong and forced.
You are allowed to use your own pencil to mark, but the printed bow marking is not used.
Driven by fear, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King’s sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to move from Versailles to Paris by a group of women on October 6, 1789.
When they were already preparing to release him, many people complained and told of the threats made against Ari and Reyna.
Because of the people, the King and Queen quickly closed the window of their dwelling.
Sometimes, there was a time when a guard’s head was displayed on a pike in Versailles before the Queen, causing great fear.
The cost of the war of US imperialism in the colonization of the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States in order to cover expenses and the interest referred to the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Surely, the great impact on the long history of Filipino subjugation is the immense wealth that fueled US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand first the hidden reasons why they were destroyed.
The age of the event being discussed falls within what is called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages is the period between the Early Middle Ages and was succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, generally ending around the year 1500.
It’s unfortunate that the scope of the term “technological determinism” is in its actual application. From this point of view, technology drives everything, to the strict assertion that the fate of people is governed by a scientific logic and this is ultimately shaped by technology.
There are two ideas commonly associated with the explanation of technological determinism: technology advances on its own path without influence from culture or politics, and because of this, technology itself influences people, rather than people influencing it.
Apparently, it seems that one of the car thieves is the one who needs to be chased by the police.
It's not enjoyable to spend money on roads throughout the country just for a few cars, so they should study a new method of driving cars to reduce the expenses of those who lose their cars.
The increasing number of road accidents has resulted in many injured people with cars. Because of this, they invented new ways to care for our fellow human beings so that damaged body parts due to accidents can be fixed.
Romanticism played a significant role in the culture of determinism, thus influencing writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, people shape geography, and customs and cultures connected to that geography are expressed, and because it reflects the desire of the community, we are better when the laws made are observed.
While Paris is now the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
This city was built as a trading center by the people around 400 A.D. and developed around 1100 A.D.
The influence of the past reached its peak in all things because their artistry revealed silks and the cultivation of food that were more valued by those who came from the shops of Byzantium.
During that time, the title Fashion Capital shifted from Paris to former Constantinople.
Gothic style became popular during the 10th to 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
During the early years, the influence of Byzantine culture was strongly felt in the region.
Despite that, because communication methods are rapidly changing, the style in education has barely changed in 25 to 30 years.
During the Middle Ages, Europe began to develop its own distinct style of dress. One of the significant results of the Crusades, brought about by the people, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
That subsistence agriculture was developed to eliminate hunger and provide for the needs of the poor and their families.
That subsistence agriculture is simply basic, mostly organic, it uses resources gathered from the ecoregion and employs crop rotation or other simple techniques to improve it.
Recently, the increasing practice is to engage in subsistence agriculture and thus contribute to the economic development of many nations.
The marginalization of cultures causes people to suffer because of the feeling of not belonging in society.
Cultures differ due to ethnicity, class, age, location, and gender.
Culture is derived from language, principles, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, and others.
The members of a culture originate from style, fashion, mannerisms, and class.
One way to apply socialization is to help children who have been abused, neglected, and are not given equal opportunities to grow.
Abandoned children become vulnerable and prone to abuse. Abandoned children are often pitied by people (similar to their parents’ situation); in other cases, this abandonment is due to the severe intellectual and physical disabilities that parents cannot cope with.
The innocent children are the victims of abuse before they are abandoned.
They will adjust the baskets they wove and also bring the small chairs they made bigger.
Because these rare conditions are mild, they rarely occur with normal conditions.
Project-based learning is good because it makes studying enjoyable and interesting, but the scaffolding went too far.
Scaffolding is a method for assisting students and it helps them to expand their knowledge and create a project.
The scaffolding is now virtual and online, just like how people use Microsoft Office.
The Virtual Scaffolding was developed in software and was created to help, analyze, and explain the concepts that students need to learn.
Children are placed in Foster Care for various reasons, such as to prevent abuse, abandonment, and neglect.
It is right that the child is lacking in care, affection, and opportunity for education.
Foster care is a safe place for children.
The foster care facility lacks sufficient resources, including caregivers who have no education and proper training.
Foster care is our concern for children.
Internet has changed the basic elements of communication, both mass and interpersonal.
Because of the advancements made by the Internet, its use has increased and many things are learned from it.
According to them, the “accessibility” and “convenience” are important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The “personal bias” and “one-sided relationship” were identified as key motivations according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they gathered opinions from people on websites.
The use of video recording is helpful so that the earth's expression can be seen every second.
It is seen in the soil how one thrives through their roots.
Oliver Sacks once said in "The President's Speech" that a difficult speech is like trying to understand someone when you’ve lost your hearing.
That's right, that ability to understand people’s character is also a quality that a good dog possesses.
The 21st century discovered two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation, which is a source of genetic variation, drives selection from expressed variation.
The segregation and recombination are present in the generations.
In the vast savanna, it is difficult for a single herbivore with a digestive system like a human to obtain the necessary amino acids from plants.
Serious problems are often caused by isolation, malnutrition, and death.
Those plants that have a lot of protein are legumes and vegetables, but they are difficult to digest if not cooked.
Conversely, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digested and provide protein which contains essential amino acids.
We were surprised to learn that our ancestors already solved the problem of protein, just like the grasslands did.
That sleep interruption is a process that briefly awakens and re-induces sleep (10-60 minutes).
It's good to be aware if you have an alarm clock.
The purpose of the alarm clock in the bedroom is to help someone wake up from sleep.
Drinking water (or tea) before exercising helps to recover and lessens muscle soreness.
That deep sorrow is a reversal of tension in the body and spirit.
There is no tension in a positive life. Problems are gone and I am content.

Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but differs in its practice from Mahayana and the techniques of Indian Yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are simple. Including Kundalini yoga, meditation and realizing the self.
In Kundalini yoga, practice breathing exercises, yoga postures, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity yoga. Through the visualization of deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened, and the mind is clarified.
Germany was very powerful during World War 2, so the USSR and US helped. After the war, the country’s system and culture were destroyed and collapsed.
After two years of ceasefire in the war, the former allied nations became enemies and began the Cold War.
For the past 40 years, wars have spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and others.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense fell, so they retreated and allied with the Romans.
That plan failed because 800,000 Soviet Union soldiers invaded Poland, after the Peace Treaty of Belgium and Poland was broken.
The use of a cargo ship helps to evacuate people.
Their job as navy is to protect the people and their properties, and also to defend the country from disaster.
America is helping Britain to evacuate people by sea using North Atlantic ships.
Back then, when the German navy used U-boats, they were able to successfully hinder traffic.
It was a fateful alliance, so Germany easily conquered Britain and like conquering other parts of Europe.
These goats are among the first domesticated animals, 10,000 years ago originating in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The old cultures and tribes used fermentation to excellently preserve milk, wood, meat, and crops.
The improved breed of goat is similar to the cattle that roam freely in other places; this goat is agile or slightly taller, like those with more extensive herding. These methods are still used today.
The roads of carriages were made in England during the 16th century.
Even though the roads are dusty and made of rough wood, these help the horses to be faster and more comfortable carrying loads, even heavy ones, compared to a muddy road.
They only used crossties on the rails to keep the tracks from moving. But it wasn’t long before they realized the tracks were stronger when there was ballast on their roadbed.
That’s how most people do it, but the tables are more easily damaged by moisture because of the varnish.
Out of time, the wooden bridges were strengthened with ironwood in 1767, and the first railway made entirely of ironwood was also used.
The earliest form of transportation was walking, but modern transportation allows people to travel two million years after the appearance of Homo Erectus (early humans).
The scientists found the Australopithecus and they said its origin is related to modern humans.
The discovery of their fossils of Australopithecus, which are 4.2-3.9 million years old, shows they walked on two legs, although Sahelanthropus is considered to have walked on four legs even earlier, around seven million years ago.
We can choose to support and consider nature, we can contribute to efforts for the environment, and we can become activists to help reduce the destruction of our resources.
It seems like that's just a remedy for the symptoms. But if what we want is not just a temporary solution, we really need to understand the root of the problem, and not postpone it.
The world has become vast due to the rapid advancement of truth in science and technology, and many problems have arisen due to overpopulation.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten document signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and its Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap for printing, whose shop was several blocks away.
Only about 150 to 200 copies were made at the time, which are now called "Dunlap broadsides".
The first reading of the document to the public was done by John Nixon on July 8 at the foot of Independence Hall.
A copy of it was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9. Another copy was sent to London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are missing now are equivalent to a hundred copies of documents. Of the five copies written, there are none left.
Scientists now believe there is a group of dinosaurs that were discovered and are still alive. Let's call them chickens.
People will think many others are dinosaurs because they are old and can still run fast.
But many were those who saw the chickens that looked like dinosaurs.
They didn't even bother trimming their nails, they were dirty, and they walked using the salt from the fermented fish like a T-Rex.
All of our computers used today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded through binary numbers.

The study of science teaches us how the world works through the scientific method. Moreover, this method guides more thorough research in science.
However, more than that, experimentation and experiments are tests used to determine if a hypothesis or one of the possible theories is correct, and observations also guide research in science.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on original texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's influence on science and psychology is well-known.
When young people in Greece get tired, the West borrows its connection from philosophy and science.
It is observed that many animals and plants, and their well-being, depend on the climate or growth of a specific season and their numbers vary over time.
Sometimes, the life cycle of organisms other than humans, especially those in the aquatic environment, is documented for research – including living things, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks have their own rhythms that continuously function even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to eliminate many bacteria in their DNA.
He did two experiments to determine whether the DNA of the virus containing radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus containing radioactive sulfur was the genetic material.
The mutation or alteration has no effect depending on the type of alteration, the significance of the change and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only the variations in the germ-line cells are inherited by offspring, but variations acquired from other sources can trigger cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is attractive to people who are interested in nature and want to experience the environment, including plants and animals.
For example, on-site activities like hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, they are done in the park and we study the ecosystem.

Every morning, people leave their homes to go to work, and others also go to work in the places they used to work.
Even with this shuttle service available to everyone, there is still a reliance and support for a transport system based on private cars.
The history of science shows that a massive carbon economy has fundamentally altered the biosphere in recent states, supporting human evolution for the past two million years.
We are cooperating with the society and using the transportation system. Many are complaining about the transportation system.
In a developed country, you would likely report complaints about water quality and the elevated bridges.
My transportation system has no complaints, why doesn't it work every day? Have the transportation engineers considered this? Or is there a fundamental reason?
The traffic flow is being studied in terms of the behavior of drivers and vehicles between the two areas and at each intersection.
However, studying traffic flow is difficult because of the increasing percentage of bad driving habits among drivers.
That's why nowadays, drivers are the ones causing accidents. Because of this, traffic flows predictably and can be understood mathematically.
To understand the traffic flow, the signal was analyzed based on these three factors: (1) flow, (2) density, (3) velocity.
This relationship helps in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.

Every year, the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, and every year they remodel the website, but they don’t remove the old versions online so it becomes a scrapbook.
This blog is very helpful for students to improve their writing skills. Even if students who share their experiences have errors in grammar and spelling, their audience can still learn from it.
Because many students are skilled in language, the blog writer continues to improve their writing so as not to be left behind.
Thus, blogging is a “task for students to become more interested in the places they are in.” Because they want their audience to be inspired, this helps students become intelligent and create topics that are interesting (Toto, 2004).
They say blogging is also a job alongside others, and it helps students learn not only in schools like the old ways of doing things.
The purpose of using a blog is "to help students become more analytical and critical thinkers; when they comment on what they read on the Internet, they express their opinions on others' writing and share their knowledge on a particular topic." (Oravec, 2002).
