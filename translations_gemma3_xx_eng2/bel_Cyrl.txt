This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides information that is usually impossible to obtain by studying fossils, for example, about the color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the feathers.
Scientists say that this animal’s feathers were chestnut-brown on top and had a pale or reddish-yellow hue on the underside.
This discovery allows for a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis—shaft—but possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a late evolutionary development compared to these other features.
Judging by the structure of the feathers, one can conclude that it was not used for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or to attract attention. Researchers suggested that, despite it being the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show not downy fluff but adult plumage.
Researchers suggest that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern suggests the plumage of an adult animal, rather than the down of a hatchling.

It has been established that the Sun functions in the same way as other stars. As it turned out, the activity of all stars in the system is influenced only by their luminosity and rotation.
The terms "luminosity" and "rotation" are used in combination to define the Rossby number of a given star. The latter relates to the plasma flow.
The star's activity relative to magnetic field reversal is less the smaller the Rossby number.

He stated, “that by 2020 they will try to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP compared to 2005.”
He didn't state the exact number of these cuts, as he said everything would depend on the volume of production in China.
He advised developing countries "not to repeat the past – to pollute first and clean up later."
He added that “at the same time, it is impossible to demand of them the fulfillment of obligations that are not characteristic of their level of development, responsibility, and capabilities.”

Primarily, theoretical work was carried out; however, based on it, a program was developed to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
Tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way could cause the effect the team was looking for.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, dark matter around a galaxy predominantly surrounds the latter in the form of a halo and appears to consist of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll found extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
Once, in an interview, he stated that the new variant "causes significant concern and anxiety, as it is characterized by a very high mortality rate."
Doctor Moll believes that a number of patients may have contracted the disease in the hospital, and at least two of those infected were hospital staff.
An infected person is capable of infecting 10 to 15 close contacts within one year.
Nevertheless, among all tuberculosis patients, the proportion of people with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis remains relatively small – only 6,000 cases have been registered in South Africa out of a total of 330,000 infected individuals throughout the entire period.

As a result of the disease outbreak, the Indian government had to enlist pig catchers to capture pigs in the areas most affected by the infection, distribute thousands of mosquito nets, and spray the area with pesticides.
Healthcare institutions will be able to prepare for next year, as the government, among other things, promised to provide several million vials of encephalitis vaccine.
Due to a lack of funds and the low priority given to other diseases, plans to deliver vaccines to the historically most affected areas have been postponed this year.

Glenn Cushing from the Astrogeology Science Center of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and a researcher at the University of Northern Arizona, located in Flagstaff, Arizona, noted, “their thermal characteristics are not as stable as in large caves on Earth, where relatively constant temperatures are often maintained, but they correspond to deep boreholes in the ground.”
The voting process in France has traditionally not been high-tech. Voters would go into a booth to retrieve a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of the corresponding candidate on it, and place it in an envelope.
After identification by election officials, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
This entire procedure is carried out in strict accordance with French electoral law.
Starting in 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent. This was done so that voters and observers could verify that there were no envelopes in the boxes at the start of voting and that no other envelopes (except those cast into the ballot boxes by duly authorized and counted voters) were placed inside them.
To attest to each part of the process, candidates may send their representatives. In the evening, following certain procedures, volunteers under strict supervision count the votes.

Cyanuric acid and melamine were both found in urine samples from domestic animals that died after consuming contaminated feed.
Researchers from the university stated that these two compounds react with each other and form crystals that can block kidney function.
Upon adding melanin and cyanuric acid to cat urine, researchers observed the formation of crystals.
Based on the results of infrared spectral analysis, the structure and composition of these crystals are analogous to the structure and composition of those found in the urine of affected animals.
I don’t know if that was clear or not, but most of the goods delivered to this country from Central America are duty-free.
At the same time, eighty percent of our goods in Central America were taxed.
It seemed pointless and, of course, unfair to me.
I always tell people – you treat us the same way we treat you.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Governor of California, approved a bill prohibiting the sale or rental of video games with excessive violence to minors.

Nikolas Alden, 25 years old, and Zakhary Kadebek, 21 years old, died in a crash. Kadebek was driving.
Christopher Schneider will need facial plastic surgery, and Edgar Vegila was wounded in the jaw and arm.
When Uka pointed the gun at the fifth soldier's head, it misfired. Schneider now suffers from constant pain and is blind in one eye. He is missing a piece of his skull, and his face is now partially made of titanium.
Schneider testified from his home country via video link, while being stationed at a US Navy base.
Besides the competition on Wednesday, Karponeda also participated in the championship in two more individual races.
First, she competed in the slalom, where she did not finish the first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result.
During the giant slalom competition, she finished tenth among women in the seated position. Her total time was 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place finisher, Austrian Claudia Lösch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth place, taken by Jongi Dani from Hungary.
Four cross-country skiers from a group of athletes with disabilities did not reach the finish line, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers failed to qualify for the giant slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were returned to the owner by the Madhya Pradesh state police.
“We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss tourist, and we were able to return her mobile phone and laptop,” said D.K. Arya, Deputy Inspector General.
Baba Kandzhar, Bhuta Kandzhar, Rampra Kandzhar, Gaza Kandzhar and Vishnu Kandzhar – these are the names of those mentioned as suspects.

First, he was admitted to the James Paget University Hospital, located in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adelaja has been held at the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh since then, as she is accused of murdering her son.
She awaits indictment and trial while in custody. However, given that her photos have been widely published, any witness testimony could be called into question.
In other regions of Great Britain, this is an established practice, however, in Scotland the justice system operates differently – courts believe that publication of photographs could potentially be harmful.
“It seems journalists are going down a dangerous path when they publish photos, etc., of suspects,” notes Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Office of the Supreme Court, authorized to initiate criminal proceedings, informed journalists that, at least until an indictment is filed, no further comments will be available.
According to the received information, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in a way that preserves the borders that existed before the start of the 1967 Middle East war.
According to the received information, among other topics covered in the document are the issues of the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both peoples, as well as the problem of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands that, after the agreement is signed, a military presence in the valley be maintained for ten years, while Palestine agrees to only five years.
The trackers who participated in the supplementary program for controlling animal populations were to be under close supervision by rangers, as the program was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service, together with the company "Australian Shooting Association Inc.", has recruited qualified volunteers to participate in a culling program implemented under the auspices of the Sporting Shooters' Association.
Mike Flynn, who is temporarily performing the duties of director of the National Park Service and wildlife protection and park heritage, stated that the four shooters selected to conduct the first shooting operation were given comprehensive safety instructions and underwent appropriate training.
Yesterday, Martelli led the swearing-in of a new Temporary Electoral Council, which consists of nine members.
This is already the fifth Temporary Election Commission of Martey in four years.
The presidential commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the Temporary Electoral Council as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
Martelly responded with a commission to the large anti-government protests that began in October.
The reason for the protests, which were sometimes violent and fierce, was the lack of elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating defective iPods were registered. This led to six fires, and four people sustained minor burns.
According to a statement from Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), they had information about those 27 accidents that occurred as a result of using the devices.
Last week, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced it had received a notice from Apple regarding 34 new cases of overheating, which the company identified as “non-serious.”
In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report to a later date "deeply regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Marianas Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 Friday GMT).
Representatives of the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency stated that there have been no reports of damage or incidents in the country.
Furthermore, according to data from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus in the Philippine capital Manila and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolanda Mendoza opened fire on tourists with her M16.
Several hostages were rescued, and at this time, according to confirmed reports, at least six were killed.
Six hostages, including elderly people and children, as well as photographers from the Philippines, were released early.
The elderly lady needed to use the restroom, so the photographers remained hostages in her place. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's example and became a doctor.
He studied to be an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women’s Hospital in the city of Oakland.
While working at the hospital, Ligins began to study the problem of premature births in his free time.
According to his research, the introduction of the hormone accelerates the maturation of lung embryos.
According to a report by Xinhua agency, government investigators on Wednesday found two so-called "black boxes" – flight data recorders.
Luna's memory was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
“The Moon was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. She left life on the night of the two months. It’s quite original, just like her. The Moon was a strong woman,” said Tony Dremer.
Dustin "Golddust" Runnels noted: "Luna was still a girl, no less than me... or even more... I love her and I will miss her... I want to believe she is now in a better place."
The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a poll of 1400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, the acting Prime Minister, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic towards the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of survey respondents. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of respondents who believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, and another 31 percent who, conversely, believe that this should never happen.
It was expected that the Olympic gold medalist would swim the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and participate in three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition is in doubt: he has complained quite a bit about his health.
He wasn't allowed to take painkillers because they were prohibited at the Games.
On January 25th, mathematician and professor of computer science from the University of Central Missouri, Curtis Cooper, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
This discovery was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software before the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is believed that comets could have brought to Earth not only organic substances that can form proteins and serve as a source of life's building blocks, but also water.
Considering that comets collided with Earth in the distant past, scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, primarily that of Earth.
A little earlier this year, 53-year-old Kuoma was elected governor. He signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He dismissed these rumors as political babble and foolishness.
It is expected that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration states that thanks to the NextGen system, airplanes will be able to fly shorter routes, which will help save millions of liters of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
Unlike older ground-based radars, it utilizes satellite technology, allowing air traffic controllers to determine the location of aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
The number of transport options isn't increasing, and overland trains won't be stopping at Wembley, plus there's no car parking at ground level, nor is there a park-and-ride facility.
The likelihood of the game being played behind closed doors, without team supporters, was increasing, as it was entirely possible that there wouldn't be enough transportation available.
The research, published in the journal "Science" on Thursday, details the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
According to a report by researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of a new species occurred in just two generations, although it was previously believed that this process required much more time. The emergence of the new species was made possible by the interbreeding of the endemic ground finch (Geospiza fortes) with the non-native cactus ground finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be cast into various shapes. It can be rolled into thin sheets.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can then be easily twisted and braided. Furthermore, it can be chipped or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate illustrations painted in books – so-called “illuminated manuscripts”.
This is called the pH level of a certain chemical substance. You can make such an acid-base indicator yourself from red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of a substance.
The pH level in the tested chemical substance is determined based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as is known, an atom of hydrogen consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix these two dry powders in a circular motion until they combine into a single mass, then make a ball out of them with wet hands.
Moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation. In the process, a kind of shell is formed.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Greek cities on Crete and Santorini that date back to the Minoan period.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths where men and women were together.
You are using a satellite when you call someone thousands of kilometers away from you.
In space, a satellite receives a call, after which it almost immediately reflects it back.
A rocket was used to launch a satellite into space. Scientists have to use telescopes in space because, due to the influence of the Earth's atmosphere, light refracts and the image is distorted.
In order for a telescope or satellite to reach space, a huge rocket over 100 feet tall is necessary.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. Easier and faster movement is the greatest thing the wheel has done for us.
Thanks to him, we got trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Below are cats of medium size. Their prey is also medium-sized—they hunt both hares and antelopes with deer.
In addition to everything, many small cats (including free-roaming pets) catch and eat a more numerous small prey – insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the fact that each occupies its own niche, i.e., has a function unique to it, and therefore does not need to compete with other cats.
Lions are among the most social of cats: they live in large groups, known as prides.
A pride may consist of up to three adult males, who are relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
In most cases, the females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides and wolf or dog packs is largely similar. The latter can, in their behavior, strongly resemble lions (but not other large cats) in that they pose a deadly danger to prey.
Tigers are capable of climbing (though not very well), leaping across large distances, swimming, and pulling with a force five times stronger than a strong human, like a well-trained athlete.
Tigers belong to the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (the panther genus). No other felines, besides these four, can roar.
The tiger’s roar resembles more a statement, composed of sharp and loud words, than the full-bodied roar of a lion.
Ocelots feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds. Almost all the animals they prey on are significantly smaller than the ocelot itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by scent, sniffing tracks on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they see well in the dark and move with great confidence. Ocelots hunt by blending into their surroundings and attacking their prey from ambush.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) splits off from the main population they originate from (let's say by moving across a river or mountain range, or when such living beings migrate to a new island, making it quite difficult to return), they often find themselves in an environment significantly different from the one they came from.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, therefore, to become a strong competitor itself, the new population will need different traits or adaptations compared to those it had before.
The original population hasn’t changed at all: as before, they still need to adapt.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, the animals increasingly differ from the original population from which they split.
Thousands, or even millions, of years will pass, and sooner or later the two mentioned populations will look so different that no one would even think to classify them as the same species.
This process we call speciation, which actually means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe. They also consume carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants "make" their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from them. We mainly eat plants. And animals wouldn't survive without plants either.
For their time, mazosaurs were apex predators, so they feared nothing and no one except other mazosaurs.
On his long jaws, over 70 razor-sharp teeth gleamed, and another row was present in the upper part of his mouth. This meant that his prey would have no chance of escape.
It is not known for certain, however it is possible that he had a forked tongue. Mosasaurs' diet consisted of large fish, turtles, and other mosasaurs. It is likely that they may also have consumed members of their own species.
Besides that, he pounced on everything that fell into the water; his snout wasn't worth even a giant like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Despite the fact that their food wouldn’t particularly surprise us, certain dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them were wild boar, peacocks, snails, and one of the rodents known as a dormouse.
Another difference lay in the fact that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy held banquets where they ate and relaxed simultaneously.
The ingredients used in dishes prepared in Ancient Rome could not include products that arrived in Europe from America or Asia later.
They had none of—specifically, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no corn, and no cocoa. It should also be added that no ancient Roman ever had the opportunity to taste turkey.
To each of their gods, the inhabitants of Babylon built a main temple, which was considered its home.
The pagans brought sacrifices to their gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs by holding various festivals and ceremonies in their honor.
Each temple had its own open inner courtyard and sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to visit.
In some cases, during the construction of temples, special towers similar to pyramids were erected. They were known as ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine, dedicated to a god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house did not hold great importance.
Mostly, the life of the Jewish family unfolded in the fresh air.
Women were cooking outdoors; shops were simply open counters facing the street. Houses were built of stone.
In Canaan, large forests were lacking, therefore wood was highly valued.
The territory of Greenland was not densely populated. According to Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and while sailing west, he discovered Greenland, which he named "Greenland."
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
There were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, despite each of these countries being “Scandinavian”.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this does not correspond to reality. Despite the fact that something is indeed written on the reverse side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, was written: “Original Version of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.” The entry in mirrored writing is located at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was originally rolled up for preservation.
Therefore, it is quite possible that this entry was added there simply as a note.
Thanks to the Normandy landings and subsequent battles, it was possible to liberate northern France, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
He was under the control of the "Vichyites." These were the French who signed a peace treaty with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon began – the Allies landed in southern France.
Americans and the Free French forces liberated the southern territories of France in just two weeks, after which they headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture of a rather large group of people who work together and live in society.
The aforementioned term "civilization" originates from the Latin word *civilis*, meaning "civic." The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun *civis*, that is, "citizen," as well as to the noun *civitas*, or "city" or "city-state." All of this, in turn, says something about the size of a society, one way or another.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through generations, even distribution, and a lasting cultural footprint.
It is not uncommon for small cultures to not be considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, as they disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. This government consisted of Congress alone.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, as no national executive or judicial authority existed, it relied on enforcing all laws with the support of state governments, which were often unwilling to cooperate.
Furthermore, he lacked the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs enacted by the states.
According to the Articles of Confederation, unanimous consent of all states was required to amend it, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent from it.
The Italian national football team, just like the German national team, ranks second among the strongest national teams in the world. In 2006, it won the FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing are among the popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, although Italians also participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is located on almost 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu Island. Due to this, Japan ranks 7th in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical standpoint, as it consists of a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan began as early as the 15th century. It was then that its name was recorded by European sailors passing by as "Formosa" – meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of primitive agricultural practices. The company hired Chinese laborers to cultivate rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) captured western and northern Taiwanese territories in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
Following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, under which sovereignty over the island was transferred to Japan, which then administered Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
To give tourists a better understanding of how most of the buildings originally looked, the latter were reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
Yes, the most popular format for still photographs in the world is 35mm. During the era of analog photography, this film format was dominant.
Such film is still manufactured today, however, more importantly, the ratio of its width to height is now used in the formats of digital camera sensors.
This might be a little confusing, but in reality, the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio for this format is considered to be 3:2 (after division by twelve to obtain the simplest proportion of whole numbers).
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) have the same or similar aspect ratios.
The rule of thirds, often subjected to criticism and ridicule, is simply advice that ensures dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in an image.
If you believe him, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photograph into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the activities of the Catholic Church came under close scrutiny, becoming wealthy and powerful.
Despite all those linguistic and cultural differences that existed, Christianity united the European countries for over a thousand years.
Everyone – from king to commoner – was under her all-pervading power.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity lies in the fact that wealth must be used to reduce poverty and alleviate suffering, and that church funds exist precisely for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the central church authorities were located in Rome. Due to such a concentration of power and money, many question whether this dogma is fulfilled.
Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of hostilities.
Although the embargo on the supply of essential goods for both military and civilian use violated generally recognized international law, which had been enshrined in legislation through several international agreements over the past two centuries, it proved to be an effective strategy.
Great Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering certain areas of the ocean, thereby endangering even neutral vessels.
Because no significant reaction to this tactic was observed, Germany believed that there would be no reaction to unlimited submarine warfare either.
Among the majority of citizens and countries during the 1920s, sentiments of pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
States and peoples intended to avoid such a situation in the future, as they had already witnessed the horrors and atrocities during World War I.
Tesla moved to live in the United States of America in 1884 because he got a job at the "Edison" company, located in New York.
All he had in his pocket upon arriving in the USA were 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Beacher (his former employer’s manager).
In ancient China, there were unique ways to denote different eras. At each stage of Chinese history or under each ruling family, distinctive dynasties existed.
Furthermore, periods of dynastic rule were interspersed with periods of divided provinces, when instability prevailed. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During the aforementioned periods, many nobles vying for the throne waged ruthless military actions against each other.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Era of the Three Kingdoms: thousands of people perished during the struggle for the opportunity to occupy the highest position in the grand palace in Xian.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them were the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism, and the belief that a country belongs not to a single ruler, but to the entire people.
Moreover, various positions after the Revolution became accessible to all male candidates, resulting in the most successful and ambitious individuals rising to the top.
The same thing happened in the army, because if military ranks were previously awarded based on social class, now they are based on skills and abilities.
Moreover, the French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that extended beyond worldly life. To meditate and contemplate, he often visited a cave on Mount Nur (meaning “light”), known as “Hira”.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, provides a very vivid insight into the spiritual foundations of Muhammad.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world — it is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it’s very difficult to find, even if someone knows about its existence. Inside the cave, you are in complete isolation.
From the edge of the clean, beautiful skies above and the many surrounding mountains, you won't see anything. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that has survived to our time.
The Great Pyramid is one of many pyramids that were built to honor the memory of the deceased pharaoh. It was built in the third century BC.
On the Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of Death in Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were dedicated to the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
The sign indicating a bow's upward movement looks like a "V", and downward – like a bracket or a square without a bottom side.
“A bow stroke upwards” means you should start the movement from the tip of the bow and lead it upwards, while “a bow stroke downwards” means you should start from the frog (that’s where your hand holds the bow) and lead the bow downwards.
A sweeping motion upwards usually produces a softer sound, while a downward motion produces a stronger and more confident one.
You can mark your notes in pencil, but don't forget that the printed symbols are there not just randomly, but for a specific musical reason, so they usually need to be preserved.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Marie Thérèse), as well as Madame Elisabeth, the king's sister, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris due to a crowd of women from the market who frightened them.
The royal family was taken to Paris in a carriage. Along the way, they were surrounded by a crowd – people in it whistled, wailed, and shouted threats at the king and queen.
The king and queen had to open the carriage windows under the pressure of the crowd.
At a certain moment, someone in the crowd waved the head of a guard killed in Versailles at the queen, who was already terrified to death.
The military expenses of US imperialists incurred during the conquest of the Philippines were to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay for a significant portion of expenses and interest on bonds that were placed through Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of US imperialists would be the super-profits gained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand who the Templars were, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the preconditions for the order's creation.
Traditionally, the era in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages – this is a period in European history that encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
First came the Early Middle Ages, followed by the High Middle Ages, and after that – the Late Middle Ages. The latter is generally considered to have ended around 1500 AD.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses a range of practical ideas, from the emphasis on promoting certain technologies or technical necessity to the precise understanding that human destiny is determined by the logic underlying scientific laws and their embodiment in the realm of technology.
Two common ideas are characteristic of most explanations of technological determinism: the very development of technologies largely occurs outside the bounds of cultural or political influence, and technologies, in turn, exert an influence on society that is intrinsic to them (and not socially conditioned).
In particular, there is an opinion that the use of cars stimulates the development of roads.
Nevertheless, if the number of cars is small, a nationwide network of highways does not make economic sense. For this reason, new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Due to the large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is increasing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in healthcare that allow for the treatment of various injuries.
A vast element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
When discussing the era of Romanticism, the geography of presence had a strong influence on people. Over time, traditions and culture connected to it emerged. They were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, as they existed in harmony with the place and the position occupied by society.
While Paris is considered the modern capital of fashion, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 AD, the city gained renown as a center of luxury and maintained this status for almost another 700 years, until around 1100 AD.
Throughout the 12th century, its status as a capital of luxury faded. This happened mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts, including sharp spices and silk, which were valued much higher than what was offered in the markets of Byzantium.
It was then that Constantinople relinquished the title of fashion capital to Paris.
The flourishing of the Gothic style occurred between the 10th and 11th, as well as the 14th centuries.
Initially, the style of clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, Western styles may be delayed by 25-30 years due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. The adoption of buttons for fastening clothes as a result of the Crusades was one of the most significant events of that time.
In natural farming, the amount of food produced only meets the needs of the farmer and their family.
Natural farming is a simple and, as a rule, organic system. It is based on the use of seeds native to a specific ecological region, combined with crop rotation or other very uncomplicated methods. The goal of all this is to achieve maximum yield.
Many farmers historically practiced subsistence agriculture. Currently, many developing countries still practice it.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views who, from the perspective of social norms, feel deprived of attention, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and (or) gender of representatives can be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a distinct subculture can be based on various factors – linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination thereof.
Members of the same subculture often define their belonging to it through a distinctive and symbolic style in clothing, manners, and jargon.
As an illustration of what socialization is and how important it is, the example of children who were unlucky enough to grow up in an atmosphere of contempt, neglect, various hardships, or humiliation and abuse, and who were not socialized by adults in childhood, is most often cited.
Such children are called "feral." Some "feral" children spent extended periods in captivity (usually at the hands of their own parents); in some cases, the lack of parental care was due to the parents' unwillingness to acknowledge serious physical or intellectual impairments and deficiencies in the child.
Before they were abandoned or ran away, feral children could have experienced serious abuse or trauma.
Others, it seemed, raised animals; reportedly, some lived independently in the wild.
If a child is raised entirely by animals, their behavior will almost completely mirror that of the animal caregiver (taking physical limitations into account); for example, such a child may fear people or be indifferent to them.
While the goal of project-based learning is to make the learning process easier and more engaging, scaffolding in this regard goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a support that helps people gain new experiences in learning. This could involve using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, both a teacher and a small paperclip in the Microsoft Office program are assistants.
The software includes virtual assistants. They are needed to ask questions, provide hints, and explain procedures that students or listeners find difficult to understand on their own.
There are many reasons why children might end up in foster care. This can include abuse, neglect, and even coercion.
We must not allow children to grow up in an environment where no one cares for them, raises them, or provides for their education, yet this still happens.
In our opinion, the foster care system is a safe space for such children.
It is expected that thanks to our foster family system, wards will have reliable medical care, safe homes, kind and caring caregivers, and stable education.
It is believed that a foster family must provide for all the needs of the child that were not met in the home from which they were taken.
The internet is a means of not only mass communication, but also interpersonal communication.
Thanks to the unique characteristics of the internet, there are additional opportunities for its use and to satisfy the needs of the audience.
Yes, for example, it is argued that concepts such as "education" and "socialization" are important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of “personal involvement” and “enduring involvement” were also defined by Eime and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when studying audience reaction to websites.
Thanks to video recording, important discoveries have been made in understanding microexpressions – these refer to facial muscle movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, among other things, that a correct interpretation of microexpressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work “The President’s Speech,” Oliver Sacks noted how people with brain damage, without understanding the speech itself, can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even speculates that animals – for example, domestic dogs – may also be capable of correctly interpreting human behavior.
The results of twentieth-century research indicate that there are two pools of genetic variability, namely, explicit and hidden variations.
Under the influence of mutation, new genetic variations arise, and through selection, they are removed from the gene pool.
With each successive generation, segregation and recombination shuffle the variations within these two pools.
In the savanna, available plant resources cannot satisfy the primates' need for amino acids if their digestive system is similar to that of humans.
Moreover, if they fail to do so, the consequences are serious—including malnutrition, stunted growth, and inevitable death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins found in legumes and foliage. However, if not properly prepared, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
Conversely, animal-sourced food (ants, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large amount of protein, rich in all the necessary amino acids and is simultaneously easily digestible.
Judging by all accounts, it shouldn't be surprising if it turns out that our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in savanna do today.
Sleep interruption refers to the intentional waking of a sleeping person during normal sleep, followed by falling back asleep after a short interval (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up, but not completely.
If you find yourself hitting snooze on your clock in your sleep, try putting it across the room. That way, you’ll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other theories based on biorhythms, it is necessary to consume a lot of fluids before bedtime (primarily water or tea, a well-known diuretic) – this forces a person to wake up at night to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the tension in their body and spirit.
Vital life force is all the more positive the lower the tension. Absolute peace and contentment are available to everyone.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
At the core of Tibetan Buddhism lies the teaching of the Buddha, which was supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and a series of methods from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini yoga, and love for all of humanity.
Followers of Kundalini Yoga claim that to awaken the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment), one must practice specific yoga poses, mantras and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a fundamental part of Tibetan meditation practice. Visualizing various deities allows for the cleansing of energy channels, the opening of chakras, and the attainment of enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to conflicts between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins – former allies transform into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years and truly saw armies of friendly countries clash. Battlefields were located in various regions – from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense was broken by September 17, 1939. Retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
Nevertheless, in just one night these plans lost their meaning, as over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army, as part of the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts, entered the territory of eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Shipping goods by ship is clearly the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the mission of naval forces was defined as enabling their country to transport people and goods, while simultaneously preventing the enemy from doing the same.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II became one of the most significant examples of this idea. With the aim of helping Great Britain, Americans strove to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the aforementioned movement, primarily using submarines for this purpose.
Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain in the same way it conquered the rest of Europe had the Allies failed.
It appears that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them to always have milk, wool, meat, and hides on hand.
Typically, domestic goats grazed in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures. Often, they were tended to by goat herders – children or adolescents – who fulfilled the role of shepherds. Livestock is still grazed this way today.
As early as the 16th century, corduroy roads had been built in England.
Although corduroy roads consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed draft horses to move at a faster speed and haul loads with greater weight than on the existing uneven roads.
Sleepers began to be used to hold the rails in place quite early on. However, after some time it became clear that movement along the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, however, due to the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the wagons wore out more quickly.
After some time, iron wheels replaced the wooden ones. The first rails made entirely of metal appeared in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man"), people began to walk in an upright posture.
Australopithecines, and their predecessors, did not usually walk upright.
Transitional specimens of australopithecines have been found in fossils dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, however it is quite possible that Sahelanthropus was already walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can be more mindful of the environment, we can become involved in the environmental movement, we can even become activists, so that the aforementioned suffering does not become very severe in the future.
Often this looks more like symptomatic treatment. However, if we need not just a temporary solution, then we must find and eliminate the root of the problem.
It is quite obvious that thanks to technical and scientific achievements, the world has changed significantly. As a result of overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles, the number of problems has increased.
After the declaration was adopted by Congress on July 4th, its handwritten copy, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to the printing shop of John Dunlop, which was located a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlop Sheets".
On July 8, John Nixon publicly read this document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6th, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
To our time, 25 of the first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides) have survived. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and even still exists today, only we call them birds.
Because of their feathers and ability to fly, many people don't consider them dinosaurs.
But birds still share many characteristics with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, lay eggs, and, like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, walk on two hind legs.
Practically all modern computers perform operations with information encoded as binary numbers.
The composition of binary numbers can include only one of two values – 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious symptoms. For example, vomiting is a rather common symptom, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
Internal poisoning can be indicated first and foremost by an open container of pills or toxic household chemicals.
Instructions for providing emergency medical assistance for this specific poison must be consulted on the label.
To designate this group of insects, entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense.
This term arose because people have long known what bedbugs are – these insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both kissing bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous parasites, having become accustomed to living in nests or in the home of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are registered in the United States of America. Accordingly, this neurological disease is a leading one among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
According to the study results, it was found that women suffer from MS twice as often as men.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising an infant does not align with their interests or the interests of the child they already have.
Such couples may give their child up for adoption.
Upon adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the child can be raised and nurtured by the adoptive couple.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, most scientific research is conducted using this method.
However, it is not only him who does so. Experimentation (a test conducted to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses through questions and observations) also guides and stimulates scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists paid the most attention to classical texts, and this included, among other things, the Bible in Latin.
The generally accepted views at that time were Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including in the field of psychology.
When the number of people who knew Greek diminished, the West found itself cut off from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorhythms observable in animal behavior and physiology largely depend on the presence of endogenous cycles, which arise as a result of the functioning of a biological clock.
In most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been observed that are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is an autonomous process. Even when signals from the outside do not arrive, the mentioned process continues in the form of independent, freely running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses, which stated that DNA is the genetic material, was tested during the Hershey–Chase experiment.
For implanting their own DNA into Hershey and Chase bacteria, phages or viruses were used.
They conducted two experiments in which DNA of the bacteriophage was labeled with radioactive phosphorus or protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of genetic material in which the mutation occurred, and whether the affected cells are germline cells, mutations can have a wide range of consequences.
Only mutations in germ cells can be inherited. The result of other mutations can be cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who are interested in visiting various natural areas and territories, as they want to enjoy the overall view and landscape, including delighting in observing flora and fauna.
As examples of activities one can enjoy in nature, one could mention fishing, hunting, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
As an example, one could cite visiting, studying, and photographing orangutans on the island of Borneo.
People leave their small provincial towns every morning in their cars to go to work. On the way, they pass other people traveling from where they just departed.
In this dynamic transport cycle, everyone is involved in and supports the private car-based transport system to some extent.
Scientific data suggests that the modern high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has greatly contributed to human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone who participates in public life uses transport systems, and almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transport systems.
In developed countries, you are unlikely to hear so many complaints about collapsing bridges or water quality.
Why are transport systems a constant source of such complaints, why do they regularly break down? Is the reason a lack of competent transport engineers? Or is something more substantial happening?
The concept of "traffic flow" implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is a complex problem, because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Drivers, fortunately, usually behave quite consistently; therefore, traffic flows are generally characterized by a certain rationally determined sequence and can be approximately described using mathematical models.
To more fully and accurately demonstrate what traffic flow represents, it was established how its three main parameters are interconnected: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The availability of these connections helps to plan and design road facilities, as well as manage their operation.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them more effectively avoid enemies, as well as find mates and food.
In most cases, insect wings are folded along the body.
Thanks to this, they can squeeze into various very small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are currently the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
A man named Aristarchus claimed several thousand years ago that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, however many held a different opinion – that the Solar System (including the Sun and other stars) revolves around the Earth.
That sounds reasonable, because while on Earth, it's hard to assert whether it's moving or not, isn't it?
The Amazon River is second in length among all other rivers on Earth and is the largest of them in terms of water volume. Its water volume is 8 times greater than that of the second-largest river.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers.
The Amazon River, into which waters flow from thousands of smaller rivers, has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles).
Although the construction of pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, no one, ever, has been able to surpass the pyramids of Giza in size and technical perfection.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments built by their ancestors, which at that time were over a thousand years old.
In Vatican City, only about 800 people live. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
Italian is used in the legislation and official communications of the Vatican.
Most of those who work in the public sector use Italian as their everyday language, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Thanks to the fact that basic chemical elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools, people have known about them since antiquity.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory stating that all things are composed of one element or a mixture of several of four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
It rather looked like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although, according to his theory, they could transform into other substances, ultimately becoming what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
The elements are similar to calcium and potassium and are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
In addition, there are alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic components. Carbon, for example, can be such a non-metallic component.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles – atoms.
The size of atoms is so small that trillions of them could fit inside the dot at the end of this sentence.
As a result, when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the significance of the pencil and the frequency of its use declined with the emergence of new writing methods.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, and no one needs a pencil sharpener anymore.
We can only guess what fate awaits the keyboard when something fundamentally new replaces it.
The principle of operation of a plutonium bomb consists of utilizing the energy of nuclear fusion, when a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
It’s like pushing a very heavy stroller up a hill. Repeated nuclear fission will release some of this energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable. This means that they tend to decay with minimal external influence or even without it.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side – about 100 km.
Under lunar dreams, the crust of the Moon is thinner, and under the highlands—thicker.
Lunar seas may be more common on the near side of the Moon, because the crust is thinner there, and therefore magma more easily rose to the surface.
Substantive theories focus on what drives people or what attracts them.
The mentioned theories proceed from the premise that people have certain needs and/or desires, which they transform into internal ones and imbue with a subjective character (in other words, internalize) during maturation.
The mentioned theories describe what specifically motivates individuals to desire what they do, and what factors in their environment might influence whether they will do certain things.
Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory" represent two authoritative content theories.
Essentially, when managers lead their former peers, two types of behavior can emerge. At one end of the spectrum will be attempts to remain “one of the guys” (or “one of the girls”).
Managers of this type may experience difficulties with performance evaluation, making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, delegating responsibility, and holding those responsible accountable.
The other extreme is a situation where a person changes beyond recognition – feels the need to change everything the team has done up until now, and to take credit for it.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Often, this type of behavior ends in arguments between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams should adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are slight differences.
Typically, virtual team members act as a contact center for the corresponding real-life team.
Considering that such teams can operate regardless of time zones, they often have more flexibility than members of traditional teams, which may not be readily understood by local management.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
A team of leaders, where each member is subordinate – this is the so-called "invisible team." It sets standards for each member.
What reason might an organization have for undergoing the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals of applying organizational learning concepts in practice.
Creativity and ingenuity can manifest when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization.
Thus, a process used by an organization whose employees strive together to overcome some obstacle can lead to the emergence of a new, innovative process that satisfies customer needs.
The organization's leadership should create a culture characterized by innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning. Only then can the organization be called innovative.
In Engel (2006), the continuous approach is a method by which organizations can achieve higher efficiency.
The theoretical approach to the study of cognition is reinforced by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. Thus, the field of research narrows and becomes more precise.
The results of the research obtained by scientists are confirmed by the presence of a close relationship between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It has long been known that different types of traumatic brain injuries, focal lesions, formations, plaques, pathological changes, and tumors in the brain affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and processes within it that were previously unknown to us.
Thanks to this, we receive a vast amount of materials and data for building simulation models, which, in turn, help us understand the processes that occur in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" usually evokes associations with science fiction, in reality, AI is a very important branch of computer science concerned with studying the behavior, learning process, and intellectual adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes attempts to make machines automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
As examples, one can cite planning and control, the ability to respond to customer requests and technical issues, as well as recognizing faces, voices, and handwriting.
They have emerged as distinct disciplines that study real-world problems and offer solutions for them.
In our time, AI is often used in economics, medicine, technical and military fields. Additionally, it is a component of software for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions are a significant part of school education. Often, a teacher takes students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
With the help of modern technologies, it is possible to organize virtual tours. Students can familiarize themselves with museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of works of art. And all of this – without leaving the classroom.
Collaborative participation in virtual tours is also a very good way to reflect on travel and share experiences in future classes.
Students at Benet School in North Carolina, for example, create a website about their trip to the state capital every year, and they revise it every year, but older versions remain online in the form of an album.
Furthermore, blogging can improve students’ writing skills. Although their grammar and spelling often “limp” at first, this usually changes for the better thanks to having an audience.
Considering that students are usually the most critical audience, the blogger does everything possible to improve their style in order to avoid criticism.
Besides this, blogging “helps students better understand the world around them.” The need to maintain audience interest inspires them and forces them to remain capable and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging fosters collaboration and encourages students to learn far more than a traditional school approach offers.
If students use blogs appropriately, they “will be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; active engagement with online materials will help students define their own position on what others have written, as well as express their own views on specific issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is an interesting and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find numerous art galleries and museums, which offer the opportunity to learn about the country's past and present.
Niagara Falls lies further south, while Lake Muskoka is located to the north, famous for its pristine natural beauty.
Precisely for this reason, and for many other reasons, tourists, visitors, and other foreigners consider Ontario a typical Canadian province.
In significant parts of its territory, located further north, very few people live, and some are almost entirely uninhabited deserts.
To illustrate in terms of population, here’s a fact that surprises many: the number of African Americans in the US exceeds the total population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located near the eastern coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Undoubtedly, Madagascar is the largest of them. When it comes to wildlife, it can be compared to a continent of its own.
Almost all islands of smaller size are either independent states or belong to France. They are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
Furthermore, the Arabs brought Islam with them to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros Islands and the island of Mayotte.
The beginning of European influence and the policy of colonialism dates back to the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope.
The northern border of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western border is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: female tourists are advised to always say they are married, even if it is not true.
Additionally, it might be useful to wear a ring (one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, they may encounter behavior that they perceive as harassment. Locals often may bother tourists, grab them by the hands, and so on.
Firmly reject men and boldly stand up for your opinion (regardless of cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!).
Modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids used this city as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city, and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the 1755 earthquake, they left this place.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Badya. The city received the name Casablanca from Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
Near the Old City of Medina, you can quite quickly find places selling traditional Moroccan goods – leather goods, pottery, tagines, hookahs, and various trinkets, however, all of them are exclusively aimed at tourists.
Goma is a city in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the border with Rwanda, popular with tourists.
In 2002, lava from the Nyragongo volcano swept away parts of Goma, obliterating them from the face of the earth. It buried most of the city streets, primarily in the city center.
Despite the city of Goma itself being quite safe, before venturing outside its limits, it’s worth doing a little research to find out if fighting is currently taking place in the North Kivu province.
In addition, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyamuragira volcano. It also offers very affordable services for mountain gorilla watching enthusiasts – it’s hard to find more attractive prices in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of Timbuktu's comparative inaccessibility, its name began to be used as a metaphor for designating distant, exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and the presence of an airport, Timbuktu today is a city dominated by poverty.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat from the desert sands.
Henry Louis Gates devoted much attention to this city in the PBS program "Wonders of the African Continent."
Compared to other cities in the country, this city stands out even more, as it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border runs along the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km². It contains 14 eco-zones, each with its own distinct animals and plants.
It is one of the most interesting places in the country, and is also considered the most significant of South Africa's National Parks.
As in all national parks of South Africa, an entrance fee and an environmental levy are charged daily to visitors of the park.
Additionally, purchasing a so-called Wild Card – a pass granting access to multiple parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa – could prove beneficial.
The name of the country Hong Kong is borrowed from Hong Kong Island, which is a center of attraction for many tourists.
The beautiful buildings of Hong Kong, which shape the city’s architectural appearance, are compared to a brilliant bar chart, and the waters of Victoria Harbour only emphasize its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be enjoyed by leaving the island and heading to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
A significant portion of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly located along the northern coastline on reclaimed land.
In the past, this place was occupied by colonizers from Great Britain, so if you want to see evidence of the country's colonial past with your own eyes, you should start right here.
The Sundarbans forest is the world’s largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and the interior of India.
UNESCO declared Sundarban a World Heritage Site. The name "Sundarban National Park" refers to the part of the forest located within India.
Not only are mangrove swamps called forests, but so too are some of the last remote jungles that once covered the Ganges plain and still remain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which water bodies or swamps occupy about one-third.
The Sundarbans forest has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and currently, according to reports, it is home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
From the interdistrict bus station (located across the river), buses depart throughout the day. However, in most cases they leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM, especially those heading east and to Jakar (located in the Bumthang district).
Due to the fact that intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days before the trip.
Comfortable and reliable Coaster minibuses manufactured in Japan serve most areas.
A shared taxi is a comfortable and convenient way to get to nearby locations—for example, the towns of Punakha (fare is 200 ngultrums) and Paro (fare is 150 ngultrums).
The bridge spanning the Oyapock River is a cargo bridge. It connects the banks of the Oyapock River, on which two cities are located – Oyapock (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock (French Guiana).
The height of the two pylons is 83 meters. The length of the bridge is 378 meters. The roadway consists of two lanes, each 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The bridge was opened for traffic only in March 2017, despite the fact that its construction was completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, after the completion of construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani, who led a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle and also practiced natural agriculture, were the most significant group of indigenous people inhabiting the territory of modern Eastern Paraguay.
Other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Payagua and Guaycuru, lived in the Chaco region. To survive, they engaged in hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, previously known as the “Giant Province of the Indies”, actually emerged in the 16th century when Spanish conquistadors encountered the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a three-hundred-year period of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to preserve its originality and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the largest tournament of the year takes place on the bowling alleys in Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, you can observe tournaments and matches on a smaller scale here.
Information about tournaments and where to purchase tickets for polo matches can be obtained from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). It is worth the same as the British pound (GBP).
On the Falkland Islands, currency can only be exchanged at the single bank in the country, located in Port Stanley opposite the "FCI West" shop.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted for payment in any place on the islands. Additionally, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley itself.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted. At the same time, they may accept British or American cash; inquire with the owners in advance about their payment methods.
It is practically impossible to exchange local currency outside the Falkland Islands, so do it before you leave.
When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in Montevideo, and vice versa. This is because the city is located south of the equator.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above +30°C in the summer months are commonplace.
Winters there can be deceptively cold: the thermometer column rarely drops below zero, but due to the wind combined with humidity, the temperature feels lower than it actually is.
The amount of precipitation remains almost unchanged throughout the year, so there are no distinct rainy or dry seasons here.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are used to seeing people, you shouldn’t feed or disturb them – wild animals remain wild.
The park authorities advise keeping a distance of at least 100 yards (meters) from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (meters) from other wild animals!
Bison, moose, deer with antlers, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking, no matter how docile they may seem.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year due to a lack of proper distance. Do not approach closely, as these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous.
Also, keep in mind that bears and other wild animals are attracted by smells, so do not carry or prepare food with strong odors, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city, with a population of just under 40,000 people, is located on the island of Upolu.

The murder of paramount chief Tupea Tamasese Lealofi III ended a peaceful gathering in the city, which took place during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
Because there are harbors on both sides of Oakland, there are a large number of beaches here. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches are located near North Harbour. They stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south along the Pacific Ocean coastline.
Here, almost all the beaches are sandy, it’s a safe place for swimming, and most have shade from sparsely growing trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers (central Auckland district) in Waitemata Harbour.
These are often overcrowded beaches for families with a large number of shops. It is safe to swim here.

Local tap water is absolutely safe and suitable for drinking. However, if you still have any concerns, finding bottled water is not a problem.
The idea of a “flat white” coffee is foreign to Australians. Espresso is a small portion of black coffee, cappuccino is rich with cream, not foam, and tea is brewed without milk.
Hot chocolate is truly just as good as in Belgium. Fruit juices are quite expensive, but the taste is excellent.
Reef trips take place year-round and in large numbers, but injuries and traumas from any of the mentioned causes are rare.
Still, we advise following the authorities’ recommendations, complying with all requirements, and carefully monitoring warnings about the need to follow safety rules.
Box jellyfish are found from October to April near beaches and around the mouths of rivers north of the town of 1770. Occasionally, they can be seen outside of this period.
Sharks are indeed here, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks avoid humans and therefore swim away from them.
Comb-toothed crocodiles primarily live not in the ocean, but in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows a traveler not to worry, as they will have somewhere to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Often, travel agents deal with specific hotels. However, you may be able to book other accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Typically, travel agents offer packages of services that include breakfast, airport transfers to and from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotel accommodation.
In addition, if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents (such as a visa) necessary to reach your destination, the travel agent can hold your booking.
It is recommended to send your suggestions for changes to the terms or inquiries to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
The vast majority of music festival attendees choose to stay on-site during the event, and, according to most attendees, it’s an incredibly important experience.
You'll have to come early if you want to find a spot near the music stage at the campsite.
Remember that even when performances on the main stages end, there might still be festival areas where music will play far past midnight.
At some festivals, families with small children can use special campsites.
We advise checking where your cabin is located when crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter – passage through ice floes can be accompanied by a terrifying noise and cracking, to which particularly impressionable people with heightened sensory sensitivity are susceptible.
The cruise program to St. Petersburg includes time for exploring the city. Passengers on these cruises do not require visas (see terms and conditions).
Typically, casinos put a lot of effort into making guests spend as much time as possible inside and lose as much money as possible. To achieve this, casinos lack windows and clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment programs. All of this is done to keep guests in a good mood and unwilling to leave the casino.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered at the establishment's expense. However, all outstanding players know the importance of staying sober, as intoxication hinders clear thinking.
Snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures – everyone planning to visit the northern latitudes or cross mountain passes should take all of this into account.
The coefficient of friction on snowy and icy roads is low, so you can't drive as if there's just asphalt under your wheels.
During a blizzard, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
In addition, visibility may be limited due to snowfall or blizzard, or icing, or condensation of moisture on the car windows.
At the same time, snowy weather and icing are a common occurrence for many countries, and transport traffic there does not stop throughout the year.
The most popular tourist pastime in Africa is, perhaps, safaris, and for many tourists it is also the most exciting part of their trip.
In its most common meaning, the term "safari" refers to an overland journey, particularly across the savanna, where one can see the beautiful wild African environment.
As a rule, individual animals, including giraffes and elephants, approach vehicles closely, and good visibility can be ensured even with standard equipment.
In Lviv, it's better to observe leopards and cheetahs with binoculars, as they are sometimes very cautious.
A walk that takes several hours, or even several days, is called a walking safari. It is also known as a "bush walk", a "hiking safari", or "footing".
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Individual competitions will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympic Games twice – they were first held here in 1964.
The situation may become complicated if you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced.

It is expected that the price of tickets for most events will range from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, while the price of standard tickets will be around 7,000 yen.
If you iron damp clothes, they will dry faster. Many hotels offer ironing boards and irons for rent, even if they are not in the room.
You can try using a hairdryer if you don't have an iron handy or don't want to wear ironed socks.
Try not to overheat the fabric (as it may shrink or even, in extreme cases, burn).
Water can be purified in various ways, with some being more effective against specific threats.
In some places, water can be boiled in as little as one minute, while in others it requires several minutes.
Filters have varying effectiveness, so if you have any doubts, you should consider the advisability of purchasing bottled water from a manufacturer with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter pests of animal origin that are unfamiliar to their home region.
Pests are capable of causing irritation (and in the worst cases, even allergic reactions), spreading toxic substances and infections, as well as spoiling food.
Typically, infectious diseases or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing a person are not considered pests themselves.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods in certain locations that are not subject to taxes and excises.
Tourists heading to countries with very high taxes can often save significantly, especially on goods like tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway are on the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, where the road often runs through remote areas.
If you have limited experience driving on country roads, always stay attentive: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes, and unexpected turns here.
The existing speed limits here are noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent stretches – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is very important to adhere to them strictly.
Interesting fact: the mobile signal here is significantly stronger than along many other stretches of the road, say, near "Pennsylvania Wilds".
Pastries in Germany are quite good, and in Bavaria, as in its southern neighbor Austria, they are quite hearty and varied.
Fruit flour products are widespread, with apples added year-round, and cherries and plums added in summer as well.
Many German pastries contain hazelnuts, almonds, and other forest nuts. Often, strong coffee is a good companion to popular cakes.
If you're looking for a small but calorie-rich pastry, try the one that, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with meat or vegetables, seasoned with herbs and spices.
There are two types of caries. It can be dry or wet. It all depends on how much liquid it contains.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually added to the curry, while in South India and some other coastal areas, coconut milk is used instead.
Indonesian food is prepared on 17,000 islands. It should be noted that Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, in the absence of further clarification, the mentioned term most often refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Currently, you can sample dishes of Javanese cuisine throughout the entire archipelago. It features a wide selection of diverse, unpretentious spicy dishes. Most commonly found are the seasonings and aromatic additives that Javanese people love – peanuts, red chili peppers, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hang from both sides of the saddle and serve as supports for the rider's feet.
Stirrups give riders more stability, but can create safety issues as the rider's legs may get caught.
If a rider falls from a horse, their leg can get caught in the stirrup. In this case, if the horse gets frightened and starts to run away, it can drag the rider along with it. To minimize the risk of this happening, some safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear special footwear with heels and a soft, rather narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety loops. If a rider pulls back on the stirrup leathers during a fall, the safety loops allow them to dismount from the saddle.
In the Cochamó Valley, a prime destination in Chile for mountaineering enthusiasts, known as the Yosemite of South America, there is a large number of large granite cliffs and obstacles.
Breathtaking views open up from the mountain peaks. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly forging new routes through the endless labyrinth of rocks.
Skiing and snowboarding, which involve gliding down snow-covered slopes on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet, are very popular.
For many enthusiasts, skiing is the main thing they do while traveling, and they are sometimes called "ski bums." They can spend their entire vacation skiing in one place.
People have been skiing for a long time – rock paintings depicting skiers date back to approximately 5000 BC.
Somewhere in the 17th century, the history of skiing as a sport began, and in 1861, Norwegians already opened the first sports and recreation ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: this is what is called skiing in remote areas, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is close to ski touring in an alpine style or alpinism, but usually does not include them. The latter are practiced on steep terrain and require significantly more rigid skis and footwear for it.
Compare the ski run with a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you’ll be able to cover a little more distance than if you were walking. However, reaching the same speed as skiing on a prepared track without a heavy backpack will be very rare for you.
Europe is a relatively small continent. Nevertheless, it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries means that tourists and travellers need to go through passport control repeatedly and submit visa applications.
At the same time, the Schengen Area functions as a single country in this regard.
You generally have the ability to cross borders without going through passport control again, as long as you remain within this zone.
Thus, if you already have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa to each country within the Schengen area, which saves time, money, and simplifies the documentation process.
There is no universal definition upon which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods as antiques if they were made more than 100 years ago.
The concept of “antiques” has certain geographical differences. For example, in North America, the age of an item required for it to be considered antique is less than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be called antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the trade culture that accompanies it is significant for people of other professions.
However, not all Sami engaged in traditionally large-scale reindeer herding. Many lived by fishing, hunting, or similar occupations, and reindeer were used primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi have modern professions. An important source of income in Lapland, where the Sámi live, is tourism.
Despite its widespread use, especially among other peoples, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and a false image of Roma people.
If a warning about the danger or inadvisability of traveling to the country you plan to visit is issued, this may affect the terms of your medical insurance for the duration of the trip or your trip cancellation insurance.
You can also use the advice of government bodies of other countries, not just your own, but their advice is intended specifically for the citizens of their country.
Yes, for example, compared to Europeans or Arabs, US citizens while in the Middle East may encounter different situations.
Recommendations and warnings about danger are simply a brief summary of the political circumstances in the country.
They often express common, superficial, and simplified views, especially when compared to more detailed information available from other sources.
Extreme meteorological conditions is a generalizing term for dangerous weather phenomena capable of causing damage, disrupting public life, or leading to human casualties.
The weather can be harsh in any part of the world. Depending on the geographical location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions, natural disasters can take various forms.
Among the various forms and consequences of extreme meteorological conditions are not only strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires, but also tornadoes, cyclones, thunderstorms, and waterspouts.
Blizzards, snowstorms, black ice, and dust storms – these are all regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any potential severe weather conditions in their region, as this may affect planned trips.
Anyone planning to visit a country where hostilities may be taking place should undergo appropriate professional training.
Perhaps, as a result of a search query online for "Aggressive Environment Course", you will receive the address of some local company.

Typically, such a course lasts from 2 to 5 days, and its program includes role-playing games, numerous first aid training sessions, as well as weapons handling.
Many books and magazines are dedicated to wilderness survival, but there are very few publications devoted to war zones.
Tourists who are considering gender reassignment surgery abroad need to have the appropriate documents for returning to their homeland.
Governments in different countries are willing to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or make changes to documents to reflect a person’s desired name and gender to varying degrees.
Foreign governments are ready to implement these documents to varying degrees.
Furthermore, surveillance at checkpoints became far more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
It's unlikely to expect that transgender individuals who haven't yet had surgery will be able to go through a scanner without their dignity and right to privacy being violated.
Rip current, often observed on a reef or in a similar location, is a return flow from waves receding from the beach.
The backflow concentrates in several areas with significant depth, which is related to the underwater topography, and fast currents may form there down to great depths.
The cause of most fatalities is fatigue, as people struggle to swim back to shore against the current, which can be impossible.
After you break away from the current, it will be quite easy to swim back.
Try to head to where you won’t get caught in the current again. Also, if your skills allow it, or if you’ve been spotted, you can stay put and wait for rescue.
Due to a shorter honeymoon phase, culture shock upon returning home can occur even before reverse culture shock. It can be more severe and last longer.
Travelers who had no trouble adapting to a new culture may find it very difficult to readjust to the culture of their homeland.
People who return to their homeland after living abroad for a significant period have already become accustomed to the culture of the new country. They have lost some of their habits once ingrained in their native culture.
Perhaps, when you first visited a foreign country, people were patient and compassionate, because they knew that travelers need time to adapt.
Many people don't expect at all that understanding and patience are needed even for those travelers who are returning to their homeland.
One of the events that might interest your children the most of all is the sound and light show held around the pyramids.
Darkness and silence envelop the pyramids before the show begins.
Usually, you can always hear the voices of tourists and merchants here. A history of light and sound is like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx serves as a decoration and acts as a storyteller of a long history.
The pyramids serve as screens for narrative plots, and different pyramids are illuminated from time to time.
Several countries claim rights to the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819. This is where the largest number of bases are located. Sixteen of them were still operational in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the mainland. The largest island is called King George Island, and it is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, one can note Livingston and Deception Islands, where a picturesque natural harbor has formed in the crater of an active volcano.
Ellsworth Land, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea, is located south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau. Then they rise again from it, forming the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range. The Minnesota Glacier cuts it in half.
The highest mountain range in Antarctica, Vinson, is located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range. The highest peak within it is Mount Vinson, reaching 4892 m.
A satellite phone may be your only option if you are in a remote area where mobile communication doesn't work.
Typically, satellite phones do not replace mobile phones, because to call from them, you need to be outdoors and have a direct line of sight to the satellite.
This service is frequently used by shipping companies, including those operating pleasure boats and expeditions that require data transmission and voice communication services.
You can find out more details about connecting to this service from your local telephone provider.
The option of combining studies with travel is gaining increasing popularity among those planning a gap year.
This option is particularly popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take a gap year before entering university without compromising their knowledge.
In fact, in many cases, a year of study abroad can increase your chances of getting into a university or college in your own country.
Studying on these educational programs is usually fee-based.
Finland is one of the best places to go rowing or boating. In addition, the “Land of a Thousand Lakes” boasts thousands of islets located both in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You can manage without a yacht on lakes and archipelagos.
Despite the fact that the largest lakes and coastal archipelagos are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks can provide a completely different experience.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime. According to statistics, there is one boat for every seven or eight people here.
Something similar can be seen in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but nowhere more so (for example, in the Netherlands, this figure is one to forty).
Most memorable Baltic cruises typically feature a prolonged stay in the Russian city of Saint Petersburg.
This means that for several full days you have the opportunity to explore the historical part of the city, returning to the ship for overnight stays.
You will not need a separate visa if you are only going ashore for ship excursions (information as of 2009).
Some cruises advertise visits to German Berlin in their brochures. However, looking at a map, you can see that Berlin is far from the sea. Furthermore, the cost of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
For people of any age and background, flying on an airplane can be a frightening experience, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced some traumatic event.
There's no need to be ashamed of it: it's the same fear as other personal fears or dislikes of certain things that many people experience.
Understanding how airplanes are constructed and what happens during flight may help some overcome the fear arising from the dread of the unknown or loss of control.
Courier services pay well for fast delivery of goods. In many cases, when delivering business documentation, goods, or parts for urgent repairs, time is of great importance.
Large companies have their own planes on some routes, however, regarding other routes and smaller firms, there was a problem.
If items were shipped by air, then perhaps on some routes unloading and customs clearance could take several days.
Sending registered baggage was the only way to receive the cargo faster. Airline regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come into play.
An obvious way to end up in first or business class is to lay out a huge amount of money for such a privilege (or even better, to have a company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: practice shows that compared to a regular economy class, you can pay four times more for business class and more than eleven times more for first class!
Essentially, there's no point in looking for discounts on direct flights from A to B in first or business class.
Airlines are well aware of the existence of a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay the maximum price for the privilege of reaching their destination quickly and comfortably. Therefore, they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is the city of Chișinău. The local population speaks Romanian, however Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a country inhabited by several nationalities and where an ethnic conflict took place.
As a result of this conflict in 1994, the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic was formed in the eastern part of Moldova. It has its own government and currency, however, no country within the EU recognizes it.
Economic ties have been restored between the two aforementioned parts of Moldova, despite the lack of success in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Among the cities of Turkey, Izmir ranks third in size. Its population is approximately 3.7 million people. It is a very good transport hub and the second largest port after Istanbul.
Today, the ancient city of Smyrna is a modern, developed, and functioning trade center, located near a vast bay amidst the mountains.
Although the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey, here wide boulevards, glazed building facades, and modern shopping centers coexist with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, as well as old mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can visit a church with an unusual octagonal shape. Additionally, from here there is a picturesque view of the neighboring island of Esturoy.
Above some graves in the churchyard, noticeable marble dove sculptures have been erected.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk around this interesting and unusual village to see its sights.
Near it, to the north, lies the romantic and captivating city of Sintra, which became famous among people from other countries after Lord Byron brilliantly described its magnificence.
Bus route number 403 of the "Skotarb" company makes regular trips to Sintra. It has a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Furthermore, we recommend visiting the sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Holy Place), world-famous for the numerous apparitions of the Virgin Mary witnessed here.
Remember that you are, in essence, on the site of mass burials, the significance of which for a large part of the world's population is simply impossible to describe in words.
And even today, quite a few men and women are still alive who had to survive here, and far more whose loved ones were killed or who worked here – both Jews and people of other nationalities.
We ask that this place be treated with all due seriousness and respect it deserves. One should not joke about Nazis or the Holocaust here.
Do not damage this place – do not write or draw graffiti anywhere.
In Barcelona, there are two official languages – Spanish and Catalan. Approximately half of the residents prefer Catalan – the majority understand it. And almost everyone speaks Spanish.
At the same time, most signs use the Catalan language, as it is official according to law.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other places.
Ordinary announcements in the metro are exclusively in Catalan, however, notices about sudden disruptions in service are made through an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Japanese and Arabic.
The residents of Paris are often called rude, self-centered, and proud.
Although it’s often just a false stereotype, when in Paris it’s still best to demonstrate your best behavior and be *bien élevé* (well-mannered). This will almost guarantee you won’t encounter problems getting around the city.
If you show a little politeness, the Parisians’ sharp manners will quickly disappear.
The large territory of Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in forest. Here you can primarily find beech, Canadian spruce, and various other coniferous trees. A mix of alpine and Mediterranean flora is also present.
Thanks to a wide range of microclimates, diverse soil types, and varying altitudes above sea level, a multitude of plant communities can be found here.
In addition, this area is home to a wide variety of birds and animals.
Besides various common species, this place is inhabited by rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie.
Women visiting monasteries should wear skirts that cover their knees. Additionally, their shoulders must also be covered.
In almost all monasteries, women who are unaware of these requirements are indeed offered headscarves. However, if you bring your own, especially if it’s brightly colored, the monks or nuns near the entrance will be very pleased.
A similar requirement applies to men – they must wear trousers below the knees.
They can also be borrowed from the stock near the entrance, but this clothing isn’t washed after each guest, so you might feel uncomfortable in skirts like these. A universal size is offered for men!
As with the cuisines of many other regions of the Mediterranean, Mallorcan cuisine is characterized by dishes made with vegetables, bread, and meat (mainly pork). In addition, olive oil is added to all dishes.
A simple and popular dish, especially in summer, is called "Pom-Oli". It consists of bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any seasonings you have on hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Even when they stand in the middle of a sentence, all nouns, as well as the pronoun Sie (meaning "You"), begin with a capital letter.
With this method, you can always distinguish verbs from nouns that denote objects.
Perhaps this also simplifies reading, but slightly complicates writing because you need to understand whether a verb or adjective is being used in a substantive form.
Most words in the Italian language are pronounced exactly as they are written, so pronunciation here can hardly be called difficult.
The main attention should be paid to the letters "c" and "g", because their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
The sounds "r" and "rr" must be pronounced differently: "caro" translates as "expensive," while "carro" means "chariot."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and predominantly linear grammar.
Therefore, after studying this grammar textbook, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and will better understand phrases.
It is undeniable that knowledge of any Romance language makes learning Portuguese significantly easier.
However, people who can speak a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to it and therefore doesn't require separate study.
As of today, modern observatories are generally outdated and function as museums or educational centers.
Typically, such observatories were located in cities or on university campuses, where they were easier to reach than modern observatories. The reason is simple – nowadays, light pollution poses a much greater problem than it did in the past.
Currently, the main part of research telescopes are grandiose objects of gigantic size, usually located in remote areas with optimal atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, which means the appreciation of cherry blossoms, entered Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
China is considered the homeland of this concept, where plum blossoms were favored.
The first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the Emperor of Japan exclusively for himself and other court aristocrats.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so don’t be tempted to pull up “just one” specimen.
If you start collecting “specimens” while visiting an officially maintained garden, you will also be kicked out without a word.
Overall, Singapore is a safe place to be and get around, and you can buy almost anything here after arriving.
However, if you found yourself just a few degrees north of the equator, in the "high tropics," you would have to contend with both heat (constantly) and bright sunshine (when the sky is clear, which is significantly less often).
Several buses also run north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
You should make sure the bus you intend to board actually goes to Hebron, and that its route doesn't end in the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
You can have a nice rest on inland waterways.
You could, for example, go on a cruise down the Danube to see some interesting places, visit castles in the Loire or Rhine valleys, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also determine routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
In Christianity, the holiday celebrated as the birth of Jesus is called Christmas. It is one of the most important holidays for believers.
Many customs characteristic of this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries, and by non-Christians throughout the world.
On Easter night, there is a tradition not to sleep, but to stay somewhere outdoors to meet the sunrise.
In Christianity, of course, there are certain theological interpretations of this tradition, but it may simply be a fertility ritual and a celebration of the arrival of spring.
The Easter service is usually held by more traditional churches on Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, and parishioners often begin celebrations at midnight, marking the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially reached the islands swam or flew there.
The main terrestrial animal on the Galapagos Islands became the giant tortoise. This happened because mammals were unable to migrate due to the great distance between the islands and the mainland.
Many mammals have appeared in the Galapagos since the arrival of humans there, including goats, horses, cows, cats, dogs, and rats.
You will be able to experience what a polar night is like if you go to the Arctic or Antarctica in winter. At this time, the sun does not rise above the horizon at all.
You can enjoy the Northern Lights because the sky will be dark almost around the clock.
In addition, you will have the opportunity to enjoy the stars, considering that these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not a problem.
Japanese work culture differs from what residents of Western countries are used to. It is more hierarchical and formal.
Typical business attire includes suits, and colleagues address each other by last name or position.
The importance of harmonious labor relations cannot be overstated. They prioritize the efforts of the entire group, not individual achievements.
Often, employees' decisions must be approved by their superiors. They are expected to follow the orders of higher-ranking managers without question.
