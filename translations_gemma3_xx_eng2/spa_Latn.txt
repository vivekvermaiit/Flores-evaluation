USA Gymnastics supports the statement from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and recognizes that it is imperative the Olympic family foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We concur with the USOC's statement that the interests of athletes, clubs, and their sports are better served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than withdrawing certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can clarify how the extent of the abuse described with such courage by Larry Nassar’s survivors was able to go unnoticed for so long, and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and the USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a protected, positive, and empowering environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and later for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
He advised Carter on foreign policy matters in the 1976 elections. Afterward, he worked as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, an already widespread theory, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this animal has chestnut-colored plumage on its upper parts and a pale or carotenoid tone below.
Furthermore, the discovery allows for a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Given that dinosaur plumage lacks a well-developed shaft, known as a rachis, but does exhibit other features of feathers (filaments and barbules), researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests its function wasn't related to flight, but rather they used it to regulate temperature or as an indicator of it. Researchers maintain that, although it's the tail of a young dinosaur, the analyzed sample presents features of adult plumage and not that of a hatchling.
The experts’ assessment was that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates the plumage of an adult more than that of a hatchling.

Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who currently holds the position of senator and is the First Lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will run for president.
The Teatro Argentino was the place where Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president; this is the same site where she launched her campaign for the Senate in 2005, representing the province of Buenos Aires.
The issue that sparked the debate was the controversy surrounding the budget allocated for relief and reconstruction efforts following Hurricane Katrina, a measure some fiscal conservatives jokingly labeled the “Bush New Orleans Deal.”
Liberal criticism regarding the restoration work focuses on the fact that reconstruction contracts have been awarded to individuals who, it appears, are Washington officials.

Although it was primarily a theoretical work, the program was written with the aim of simulating observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a gravitational pull on our planet and causes tides.
Experts concluded that dark matter affects each other just as regular matter does.
This theory posits that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is situated around it in a kind of halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African area of Zululand.
During an interview, he/she pointed out that the new variant was causing “a great deal of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate.”
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of those infected were healthcare workers at that hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they have had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total group of tuberculosis patients still appears to be low: 6,000 out of a total of 333,000 individuals infected at a particular time in South Africa.

As revealed by the infrared images, temperature variations between night and day suggest that these are likely caves.
During the day, its temperature is lower than that of the surrounding surface, and at night, it is higher.
"While its thermal behavior isn't as regular as large caves on our planet, which typically maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with these deep cavities in the ground," said Glen Cushing, of the archaeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After election officials verify the identity of the person presenting themselves to vote, they insert the ballot into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
French electoral law establishes procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that there are no ballots inside at the start of voting and that no others are added except those of people who are voting, duly counted and authorized.
The candidates have the right to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process, and during the night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

The bill stipulates that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a sticker reading "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a $1000 fine for non-compliance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be taken to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take over the business minister post that Davey is vacating.
February 16th is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21, died. The latter was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required reconstructive facial surgery.
Uka's weapon jammed as she aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers from permanent pain, is blind in one eye, is missing a portion of his skull, and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championship in addition to Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he received a “Did Not Finish the first run,” as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the seated women’s category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four seated category skiers did not manage to complete their runs, and a total of 45 participants out of 117 in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: “We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza, and Vishnu Kanjar are the defendants.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house at the time of the car impact, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then they transferred him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh County Court, charged with the murder of her son.
Although she is currently in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, any statement from an eyewitness may be questionable, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is common practice in other regions of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system operates differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted: “It seems journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects.”
The Crown Office, responsible for the prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comments would be made at least until the indictment is issued.
According to the leaked information, the document will address the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the limits in place before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also discussed, according to reports, include the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA only accepts five.
During the supplemental pest control trial, rangers were required to closely supervise the shooters, as their effectiveness was being monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited from within the Association’s hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is currently in charge, temporarily, of the Conservation and Heritage office of the NPWS Park, noted that comprehensive safety training and instruction were provided to the four shooters selected for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its acronym in English).
In four years, it will be Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the previous electoral council to resign, as part of a series of measures aimed at leading the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread protests that began in October against the regime.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the fact that elections have not been held, in some cases since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPods with malfunction and excessive heating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having recorded 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company categorized as “not serious.”
The ministry issued a statement regarding the delay in Apple's report, saying it was "truly regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reported no reports of damage in the territory.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far, at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers were released early.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was riddled with bullets.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital around 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
Their study demonstrated that fetal lung maturation in the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators managed to recover the flight recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to her.
Tommy Dreamer stated: “Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She passed away on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin Golddust Runnels stated: “Luna was as strange as I was; even more so, perhaps. I love her and will miss her. I hope she’s in a better place.”
Since 2008, among the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, there has been an 8% increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, the interim prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once Queen Elizabeth II’s reign ended.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Isabel II to be the last queen of Australia.
At one end of the survey, 29% of people believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other end, 31% believe it should never do so.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but their fitness has been called into question following their complaints.
He hasn't been able to take medication to relieve the pain, because its use is prohibited during the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Many people verified the finding using various types of hardware and software, and it was revealed on Tuesday, at the beginning of February.
Possibly, comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as a source of organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists expect to understand how planets originate, particularly ours, given that comets crashed into Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the start of the year and last month signed a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He dismissed the rumors as “political gossip and nonsense.”
It is speculated that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It employs satellite technology, in contrast to the old land-based radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise data.
No additional transportation will be provided and trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and park-and-ride will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transportation, the possibility of holding the game behind closed doors, without the team's fans, was considered.
On Thursday, the magazine Science announced research reporting the discovery of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University in the U.S. and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that the new species managed to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and a migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on all kinds of shapes and be rolled into tiny figures.
It can not only be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to draw it out into a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can become very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it was once used to decorate the handmade illustrations in books called “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can create a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice will change depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical being analyzed determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of stripping an electron from a proton.
Shake both dry powders together, and afterward, with sanitized and wet hands, squeeze them to form a ball.
A reaction will occur between the moisture on your hands and its outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewage systems were found.
They also had sanitation systems in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets, and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, a satellite is being used.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and view we have.
A giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to be able to carry a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has modified the world in surprising ways. The most relevant thing it has done for us was to provide much simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transportation, such as the railroad or the automobile, among many others.
Below them, there are felines of a more moderate size that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including independent domestic cats) that feed on smaller species that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept: each feline has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, and their lives unfold within large groups called prides.
Herds are composed of one to three adult males from the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Generally, females are closely related to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides exhibit the same behavior as those of wolves or dogs, with whom they share a surprising similarity (unlike other big cats) both in their conduct and in their highly lethal nature towards their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, make extensive leaps, and pull five times stronger than a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four felines capable of roaring.
The tiger’s roar isn’t a fully resounding sound like the lion’s, but rather, it’s like a prayer of words said in growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. When possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of their prey will be much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and can see well in dark places, and furthermore, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main group they originated from (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they migrate to a new island in a way that makes it difficult to return), they will frequently find themselves in an environment different from the one they were accustomed to.
The new environment features different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need characteristics or adaptations different from those it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still requires the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, and as the emerging population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to classify them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an unavoidable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (release).
Plants generate their food with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. Additionally, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and also make clothes with them. Most of the food we consume are plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing except others of its own kind.
Its long jaws held over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set embedded in its palate, meaning anything that passed before it had no escape.
We don't have certainty, but it could have had *Hesperornis*. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as the T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would seem quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent, the garden dormouse.
Another difference between them was that humble folk and women ate seated on a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and reclining on their side while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao, and no Roman of antiquity ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, considered its home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to meet the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Occasionally, special pyramidal towers, known as ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower served as a special sanctuary for their deity.
Amidst the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were merely counters facing the street. Houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Very few inhabitants lived in Greenland. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter and, during a voyage he undertook further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited the area by that time.
While each country separately was “Scandinavian,” marked differences existed regarding the people, monarchs, customs, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might believe a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the back of the document does have something written on it, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has the phrase “Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776” written on its reverse side. The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although it is not definitively known who drafted it, it is known that shortly after it was made, the enormous parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added simply as a label.
While the landings carried out during D-Day, as well as the subsequent fighting, had achieved the liberation of northern France, the south still remained to be liberated.
Their government was in the hands of the French of “Vichy,” who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the so-called "Operation Dragoon" was launched, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had achieved the liberation of southern France and were continuing on to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of which a large group of people who live and work together are a part; in other words, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, and is related to both the word *civis* from the same language, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, whose meaning is city or city-state and which, furthermore, in some way determines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A culture of civilization entails a prolonged intergenerational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy, and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and fail to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which Congress was its only component.
Congress lacked the authority to levy taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, that function fell to the authorities of the states, who frequently did not cooperate in enforcing all of its laws.
He was also not authorized to nullify tax laws or tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous approval from all states to proceed with amendment, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives frequently were absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among the most popular sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are gaining popularity in northern regions, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
In Japan there are around 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical standpoint.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors navigating the area recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, meaning “beautiful island.”
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transformation in the indigenous method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty army (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared it a province dependent on the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government adhered to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control of the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu features three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can visualize how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had already been restored, and work continues to this day.
To illustrate, the most common still photography image format globally is 35mm, which was the most used film size towards the end of the analog film era.
Today it is still produced, but more importantly, its dimensional relationship was transferred to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Indeed, the 35mm format is somewhat confusing, as its dimensions are 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest whole number ratio) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS format group) are identical to or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant mockery and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that generates dynamism while also allowing a certain order to images.
Indicate that the most effective position to place the central object is at the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For over a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are reserved for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for over a millennium, and this concentration of power and money led many to wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the disruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such measure violated generally recognized international law and as enshrined in several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Great Britain diverted international waters in entire sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even endangering neutral vessels.
Having received a limited response against this tactic, Germany expected to encounter a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during World War I, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from repeating itself in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demarcating different periods of time. Each stage or each family in power constituted a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with divided provinces. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which developed over 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out among many nobles vying for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms period, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the grand palace in Xi'an.
Its political and social consequences are numerous, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same happens with the military, as, instead of basing army ranks on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to confront their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as “Hira” on the mountain of “Noor” (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured through time, realistically illustrates the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave completely detached from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one were certain of its existence. Inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside this cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramidal structures of great size constructed to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or “Giza Necropolis,” in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type—smaller tombs and temples—were erected in honor of his wives and family.
The “upward arc” mark resembles a V, and the “downward arc” mark is similar to a staple or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while a downward movement is louder and more incisive.
Feel free to make your own pencil markings, but remember that the markings on bowed instruments have been printed there for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four years old), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and hurling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of an executed royal guard in Versailles in front of the queen, who was panicked.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds that fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
From now on, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main profits of North American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events take place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (that is, between the years 1000 and 1300 A.D.).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from technological drive or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence, and that, at the same time, technology has “effects” on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small volume of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of vehicle ownership.
The massive use of automobiles also leads to a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which in turn drives the development of new techniques in the healthcare field to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in Romanticism, according to scholars such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed that, by being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 BC and extended to approximately 1100 AD.
During the 12th century its status declined, largely because, upon their return, the crusaders brought gifts – such as silks and spices – which were valued more highly than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
The title of “fashion capital” was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The height of the Gothic style took place during the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the way of dressing received great influence from Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could lag by about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own. One of the most significant advancements of that era was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is understood as that whose objective is to produce enough food to exclusively meet the needs of the farmer and their family group.
Subsistence farming is a simple, generally organic practice that combines the use of locally sourced, native seeds with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of most farmers was subsistence agriculture, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by societal standards, and offer them the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: the age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to it by using distinctive and symbolic style, such as fashions, gestures, and slang.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for illustrating the importance of socialization is to analyze the few and unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their development.
These children are nicknamed "wild children." Some wild children are confined by people, generally their parents. In some cases, a child’s abandonment is due to the parents’ rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability the child has.
It is possible that wild children may have suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When a feral child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, they exhibit behaviors (within their physical capabilities) almost entirely identical to those of the specific animal that raised them, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; rather, it is support provided to those navigating a new experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can appear in both real and virtual formats; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the little animated paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is incorporated into the software and its function is to question, stimulate, or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand on their own.
Children are taken into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment without affection, care, and education; but it happens.
We can see that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, consistent education, and reliable medical care.
The goal of foster care is to meet all the needs that were not being met in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet open the way to new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and gratifications.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), “personal involvement” and “lasting relationships” were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, significant findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that, by accurately reading one’s microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," explained how those who cannot comprehend speech due to brain damage can, nevertheless, assess sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that skills for interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through research conducted in the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The mutation process introduces a new genetic variation; the selection process removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation from one generation to the next.
In the savanna, it is not easy for a primate—whose digestive system is the same as a human’s—to satisfy its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Moreover, not doing so carries serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have constituted the most easily accessible source of plant resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
However, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Ultimately, it shouldn't surprise us if our own predecessors solved their "protein problems" in the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption consists of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a more or less gentle alarm clock that brings him back to a conscious state, although without fully waking him up.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person experiences is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force we possess. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing hindering the path is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of the Buddha, they expanded along the path of Mahayana love and numerous yoga techniques from India.
In general terms, Laísmo is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels can be cleared, chakras activated, and awareness of enlightenment developed.
Cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. Once the war ended, clashes of system, process, and culture ultimately drove the two countries apart.
Two years after the end of the war, those who had been allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and be truly fought, through proxy militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Because the Polish defense had already collapsed by September 17, 1939, their only hope was to withdraw and reorganize within the extent of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since time immemorial, the function of the navy has been to ensure its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The Battle of the Atlantic during World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, attempted to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Great Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat, and hide, ancient peoples and tribes began to domesticate them.
Generally, domestic goats were gathered into herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goat herders who were typically children or adolescents, similar to the more popular shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
In England, railway tracks had already been laid as early as the 16th century.
Even though the cart tracks were made of simple parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and haul heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
The introduction of sleepers to hold the rails in place occurred quite early on. However, gradually, they realized that the rails would be more efficient if their tops were clad in iron.
It became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wagons' wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with ones made of iron, and in 1767, solid iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transportation known to humankind was walking. Humans began to do so in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedalism have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living a more planet-friendly life, join environmental movements, or even become activists and fight to lessen future suffering, even if only to a small degree.
It is, in many cases, like symptomatic treatment. But if we don't seek only a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is evident that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of humanity's technological and scientific advancements, and problems have been intensified by overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, just a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
It was John Nixon who first read the document, and he did so in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6th, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it to be read to his army in New York on July 9th. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 photographs by Dunlap, of which only a few are still known to exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are birds.
Many people don't picture them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have scaled and clawed limbs, lay eggs, and move on their hind legs just like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate based on the manipulation of data encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, which are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be finding an open container of medications or toxic chemical cleaning products.
Read the label for specific first aid information relevant to that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient connection to bedbugs, a species highly developed for parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs and assassin bugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. is around 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, comprising the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
Studies indicated that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be the most suitable thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that a different couple can take custody of the child.
The primary objective of science is to decipher how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
However, this is not experimentation; it is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was placed on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially questions of science, even psychology, were accepted.
As the mastery of the Greek language declined, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots, both philosophical and scientific.
Frequently, many rhythms present in physiological processes and behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustained manner and have a free-running cyclic operational period, even in the absence of external stimuli.
One key indicator that DNA consisted of a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while those that occur in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism often attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes animal and plant wildlife.
Some examples of possible activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, taking photographs, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and often encounter others whose jobs are located in the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuter stream, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transportation system based on the use of private automobiles.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
What is the reason for transport systems generating complaints of such magnitude, and why do failures occur daily? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is not a simple task, as it is not possible to make exact predictions about driver behavior.
Fortunately, there is a tendency among drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and be subject to approximate mathematical representation.
In order to more clearly illustrate the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both the planning and design, as well as the operation of traffic devices.
The first species to take flight were insects. This helped them evade their enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of their body.
This gives them a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects unable to fold their wings.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This makes sense, since we don't perceive its movement on Earth, right?
The Amazon River is the most voluminous and the second longest river on the planet. It contains 8 times more water than the next largest river.
Additionally, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, reaching a width of up to six miles in some places.
Of all the water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River stretches 6,387 km (3,980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, those of Giza were never surpassed, either in size or in the sublimity of their construction technique.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Kingdom were awestruck by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time dated back over a millennium.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the world’s smallest independent country and the least populated one.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both to draft its regulations and to issue its official communications.
The language spoken daily by most of those who work within the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The entirety of citizens who live in Vatican City adhere to the Roman Catholic religion.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It bore a greater resemblance to the states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, except that, at the same time, he had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, metals like gold and silver also exist.
It is also possible for alloys to exist with the presence of small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are non-metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the period at the end of this sentence could contain trillions of them.
Therefore, when it was invented, the pencil gained many friends.
Unfortunately, following the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Nowadays, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer emerges.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when rolling a heavy car uphill. By splitting the core one more time, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning they tend to decay with a minimal or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It's possible there are more seas on the near side because its crust is thinner, which allowed lava to rise to the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on discovering what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines maintain that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to continue being “one of the guys” (or girls).
Managers in this category struggle to make decisions that will be unpopular with employees, impose disciplinary measures, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold staff accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, it transforms into an unrecognizable person who believes it necessary to change everything the group has been doing and do it their own way.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that govern traditional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are slight differences.
Frequently, members of a virtual team act as a point of contact for their closest physical group.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional team, thanks to the ability of their teams to meet according to different time zones that, for example, might not be accommodated by local management.
The existence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) also constitutes a unique element of virtual teams.
The “invisible team” is the group in charge of management and to whom each member reports. It sets the standards for each member.
What motivation could an organization have for undertaking the demanding process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to drive innovation.
When all available resources are used appropriately in an organization's operational departments, it creates space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this, it is possible for the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty to lead to a new, innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first foster a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offers factual evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore narrow the field of research and confer greater accuracy upon it.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the ability to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which favor our understanding of mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant specialty within computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include, among others, monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as facial, handwriting, and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-world problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in the sectors of economy, medicine, engineering, and the military, just as they have been incorporated into various video game and personal computer software applications.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes hand-in-hand with technology, through virtual field trips. Students can observe objects displayed in a museum, visit an aquarium, or contemplate beautiful works of art while seated with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also an excellent way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a webpage about their trip to the state capital, and each year the page is updated, but previous versions are preserved online as a kind of memory album.
Blogs can also contribute to improving students’ writing skills. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with little attention to grammar and spelling, this generally changes when faced with an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging “demands that students be more understanding of the world around them.” The need to spark audience interest inspires them to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs “can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, they can define their positions in the context of others’ writings, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries showcasing the country's history and present day.
Niagara Falls are located further south, while the north harbors the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and the expanse that follows.
All of these aspects, among others, are what distinguish Ontario as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are wilderness, almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The location of the islands of East Africa is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and became established, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial foothold of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the route connecting the Cape of Europe with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is advised that all female visitors state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It would also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that being followed, grabbed by the arm, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to defend your position (even if there are cultural differences, that is not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used it as a strategic port, known as Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name Casa Branca, but in 1755 they abandoned it following an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan and named Daru l-Badya, but the Spanish merchants who established their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all of Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, there are plenty of places selling traditional Moroccan items, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of knick-knacks, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside the city should be considered with awareness of the ongoing clashes in the North Kivu province.
In turn, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and its mountain gorilla trekking excursions are among the most affordable in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can opt to take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short ride.
This, coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has given “Timbuktu” an image of an exotic and faraway land.
Although Timbuktu is now a city in poverty, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates’ PBS special, *African Wonders*.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each of which supports different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all of South Africa's nature reserves, there are daily conservation and park access fees.
It may also be convenient to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all of the country’s National Parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the namesake island, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The deployment of buildings outlining the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a luminous bar graph, made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront, located across from it.
It is in the reclaimed lands of Hong Kong's north coast where its urban development is densely concentrated.
This is the site that British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see evidence of this region's colonial past, it is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world’s largest mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage site. The section of the forest within Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
Despite this, forests are not only mangroves, but also possess some of the last remaining trees of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans encompasses an area of 3850 km2, and nearly one-third of its expanse is covered by water or wetlands.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses depart from the station between districts (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Because buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster bus service, which is comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans it, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes 3.5 m wide.
Under the bridge there is a 15-meter clear space, and although its construction was completed in August 2011, it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that currently makes up eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani people, who were the most important indigenous group in the region and lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered, and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish initiated the era of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its character and indigenous identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Other tournaments and lower-level matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
On the website of the Argentine Polo Association you will find information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can exchange your money there. It is opposite the FIC West shop, in Stanley.
Pound sterling is usually accepted anywhere within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There's a chance credit cards won't be accepted on the outer islands, but British or American currency might be. Ask the owners in advance to determine which payment methods are accepted.
It is practically impossible to exchange money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, therefore, make sure to do so before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures exceeding 30°C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceiving: while temperatures below freezing are very rare, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren’t specifically “rainy” or “dry” seasons; the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
While many of the park's animals are accustomed to seeing people, wildlife remains wild, so you should not feed or disturb it.
According to park authorities' instructions, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
Regardless of how docile they may appear, the truth is that bison, wapiti, moose, bears, and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors suffer injuries each year from not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that release strong odors and keep your campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa, the city of Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval standoff when seven German, American, and English ships refused to leave.
They sank all the vessels, except for one British cruiser. Nearly two hundred American and German individuals died.
During the war for independence faced by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the murder of head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, due to the fact that Auckland has two harbors. The most well-known are found in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, on the Pacific Ocean, lie the North Shore beaches, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy with safe swimming spots and mostly have pohutukawa trees offering shade.
Beaches along Tamaki Drive, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, unfold along the Waitemata Harbour in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available nearby. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and it isn't complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a great variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transport.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is readily available.
Australians consider the notion of a “flat white” coffee to be foreign. A small black coffee is called an “espresso,” cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam), and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Numerous trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and there, injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Regardless, heed the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay special attention to safety alerts.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them fear humans and would swim away.
The ocean is not where saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Their primary habitat is the river estuaries located north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance of your trip gives you the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you in case you need time to better consider the offer, or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as, for example, a visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, most of those attending the musical events choose to camp on-site, and the majority of spectators consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you will need to arrive at the campsite early to secure a spot near the musical events.
It should be kept in mind that, although the musical performances may have finished, other areas of the festival could continue late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas, intended for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, find out where the cabin is located, as crossing the ice generates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During cruises to Saint Petersburg, time is also spent in the city itself. Those who disembark are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Normally, casinos make great efforts to maximize the time and money their customers spend. Generally, there are no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special promotions on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and on the premises.
Some establishments serve alcoholic beverages for free. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should anticipate the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as you would on dry pavement.
During snowstorms, a large amount of snow can fall, trapping you very quickly.
Additionally, visibility can be reduced by snowfall or by condensation or ice forming on the car windows.
Furthermore, in many countries ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows with almost no interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely Africa’s biggest tourist draw and the most memorable part for many visitors.
The popular use of the term "safari" refers to overland journeys to view the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles, and standard equipment will provide a good view.
Sometimes, lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be shy, so you’ll have a better chance of observing them using binoculars.
The excursion known as a walking safari (also called a bush walk, hiking safari, or walk) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. A number of events will be held at other locations in Japan.
Host of the sporting event in 1964, Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, complications may arise.
There are different types of travel cancellation policies, but since the end of March, the coverage of many of these coronavirus-based policies does not extend until July 2020, which is when the Olympic Games are scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between JPY 2500 and JPY 130,000, and common passes will cost JPY 7000.
Ironing clothes while they are still damp can help to dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards to lend to travelers, even if one isn’t in the room.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't want to use ironed stockings, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be sure not to let the fabric get too hot, as it could shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
There are various methods for purifying water, some of which more effectively target specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others, several more minutes are needed.
Not all filters have the same effectiveness, and if this concerns you, you should consider buying bottled water with a seal from a certified company.
It is possible that travelers may encounter animal pests unknown in the regions they come from.
Pests are capable of spoiling food, causing irritation, or, in more serious cases, triggering allergic reactions, spreading venom, or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases, on their own, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals through the use of their strength, are not usually included in the category of plagues.
Duty-free shopping offers an opportunity to acquire, in certain locations, products exempt from duties and consumption taxes.
Travelers visiting countries with a high tax burden can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on goods such as spirits and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions and frequently traverses remote and isolated terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: there are many steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the preceding and following stretches, typically ranging from 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is even more important than in any other section.
However, curiously, cell service is much better here than in many other sections of the highway like Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are of good quality, and in Bavaria, the cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those made in Austria, its southern neighbor.
Fruit pies are common, with cooked apples inside throughout the year and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Generally, popular pastries pair excellently with a strong cup of coffee.
If you're craving small but tasty pastries, try a Berliner, also called Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a recipe based on herbs and spices and served with meat or vegetables.
We can find curry “dry” and “wet,” depending on the volume of liquid.
In the inland towns of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry. In southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, it is common to consume coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a broad term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines distributed throughout the country.
However, used without any other qualification, the term tends to refer to the gastronomy originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Javanese gastronomy, currently available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of dishes seasoned with simple spices, with a predominance of the aromas favored by Javanese people, such as peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the supports for the feet of riders that hang on both sides of the saddle.
While they provide greater stability to the rider, they can present safety problems, as it is possible for their feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but remains with one foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the animal bolts. To reduce the risk, there are a number of safety precautions.
First of all, most riders use riding boots with a heel that have a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Additionally, there are saddles, especially English ones, with safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from its structure if a rider who is thrown pulls backwards.
Cochamó Valley is Chile's most popular climbing destination and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of extensive walls and granite cliffs.
The summits also offer stunning views from the peaks. Climbers from all corners of the globe are constantly forging new paths among their walls of infinite potential.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular disciplines that consist of gliding on skis or a board fixed to the feet, over snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called “ski lovers,” who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old, as there are cave paintings depicting skiers that date back to around 5,000 BC.
As a discipline, alpine skiing dates back no later than the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians founded the first ski recreational club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: also known as ski touring, cross-country skiing, or ski mountaineering.
While they are related, it generally does not involve backcountry skiing or alpine-style mountaineering, which are practiced on steep slopes and with much more rigid skis and boots.
Imagine the ski slope as a hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, it will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if walking, but will very rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a good-weight pack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to manage visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
However, the Schengen Area functions as a single country in this regard.
Generally, whenever you travel within this region, you will be able to cross borders without going through another passport control checkpoint.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you don’t need to manage permits for each member country of this area separately. This will save you time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a universal criterion to determine when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, with the age limit potentially being narrower in places like North America than in Europe.
It can happen that handmade products are classified as antiques, even if they are newer than mass-produced goods with similar characteristics.
Reindeer herding constitutes a fundamental livelihood among the Sami people, and the culture related to this commercial activity is important to many engaged in other professions.
Even so, and even traditionally, not all Sámi people have dedicated themselves to large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived from fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, using reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people work in modern commercial activities. Tourism represents a significant income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the term "gitano" is often given an offensive connotation, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If your destination country is subject to a travel alert, it could affect your medical assistance or trip cancellation insurance.
It's possible they want to consult the recommendations of other governments, but those are designed for their own citizens.
For example, a North American visitor in the Middle East might encounter situations different from those of a European or an Arab.
Travel advisories are simply a concise summary of the political situation in another country.
The viewpoints presented tend to be superficial, generic, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
The term severe weather generally refers to any hazardous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption, or the death of people.
Severe weather can occur at any point on the planet, and different types exist depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Hurricanes, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are types and consequences of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, or cyclones.
Among regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena, we find strong gusts of wind, snowstorms, ice, or dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to familiarize themselves with any extreme weather risks in the area they are visiting, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a trip to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
It is likely that searching for "Course on hostile environments" on the internet will lead you to the address of a local company.
Typically, a course will cover all the topics that have been discussed here in much more detail and, generally, with practical experience.
A course typically lasts between 2 and 5 days, and includes role-playing, first aid, and sometimes even weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Passengers who have gender reassignment surgery scheduled in another country should ensure they carry valid documentation for their return trip.
The position of governments regarding the possibility of issuing gender-neutral passports (X) or updated documents to align a person's name with their self-identified gender is varied.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies greatly.
Security checkpoint inspections have become more invasive since 9/11.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through scanners with their dignity and privacy intact.
Rip currents are the flow that retreats from breaking waves on the shore, frequently at a reef or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow converges in certain areas of greater depth and there a fast current with a direction towards deep waters can originate.
Most deaths occur due to the exhaustion caused by trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as I manage to escape the current, swimming back won't be any more complex than usual.
Try to get somewhere she can't reach you again, or, if you have the skills and someone has seen you, it might be wise to wait for rescue.
The impact of returning home hits before culture shock does (there’s no “honeymoon” period of happiness), takes longer to fade, and can be more difficult.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have many difficulties readjusting to their native culture.
When they return to their home after living abroad, they will have adapted to that new culture and will have lost some of the habits of their native culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were likely patient and understanding, as they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not realize that tolerance and understanding are also necessary for returning travelers in their homes.
The light show and the pyramidal sound are one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
In the darkness, you can see the pyramids and contemplate them in silence before the show begins.
Generally, you will be able to hear the sound of tourists and vendors at all times. The history of sound and light is like a fairytale.
The sphinx appears as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and they are all illuminated.
The discovery of the South Shetland Islands occurred in 1819, and several nations lay claim to them. They have the highest number of bases, reaching sixteen active ones in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the mainland. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston and Deception Islands, where there is a spectacular natural harbor formed by the flooded caldera of an active volcano.
Ellsworth Land, whose boundaries are defined by the Bellinghausen Sea, is a region located south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the Peninsula blend with the plateau and then re-emerge to form the 360 km Ellsworth Mountains range, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern sector, Sentinel Range, are found the highest peaks of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a summit at 4892 meters on Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, where cellular phone coverage doesn't reach, a satellite device might be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot be compared to a cell phone, because, to make a call, you must be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is typically used in waterborne transport, including recreational vessels, as well as for expeditions requiring remote data and voice capabilities.
You can consult with your local telephone service provider for more information on how to subscribe to this service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option among those planning a gap year.
This is very popular among high school graduates, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a study abroad program during a gap year can, in fact, increase the chances of accessing higher education upon returning to one's home country.
Normally, an enrollment fee will be charged to register for these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating: the "land of a thousand lakes" also boasts thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
A yacht isn't always necessary in archipelagos and lakes.
While coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are spacious enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but apart from that, it's quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most luxury cruises that travel through the Baltic Sea include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that they have the possibility of taking a few full-day visits to the historic city during their return trip, sleeping on the boat at night.
If you only disembark during excursions booked through the ship, a separate visa is not required (since 2009).
Berlin, Germany appears in the brochures of some cruises. However, as can be seen in the map above, that city is not near the sea and its visit is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can generate fear in people of any age and from any place, especially if they have never gone through the experience or if they have lived through a traumatic situation.
You shouldn't feel ashamed of it: it's in no way different from other types of fears and personal dislikes that afflict so many others.
For some, understanding a little about how airplanes operate and what happens during a flight can make it easier to overcome a fear that stems from a lack of knowledge or a feeling of not being in control.
Courier companies are paid very well for making fast deliveries. Frequently, time is critical when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Large companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for smaller businesses and other routes.
If they shipped via air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations prohibit transporting baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to travel in first or business class on a plane is to spend a fortune for that privilege (or, better yet, to have your company pay for you).
But this comes at a price: generally speaking, you can end up paying up to four times the economy fare for business class and up to eleven times as much for first class.
Generally, it's a waste of time to look for discounts on first or business class seats on direct flights.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. Its regional language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a republic composed of many ethnicities, among which conflicts of that nature have arisen.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the majority religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third most important city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, evolved, and bustling commercial metropolis, established around an expansive bay and surrounded by mountains.
Both the expansive boulevards, buildings with mirrored facades, and cutting-edge shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, from the 18th-century market to the old mosques and churches. Nevertheless, its atmosphere more closely resembles that of the Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The town of Haldarsvík offers excursions to the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual church shaped like an octagon.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures shaped like doves on some graves.
It's worth dedicating half an hour to taking a walk through the fascinating town.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and stunning city of Sintra, which gained popularity among foreigners following a vivid account of its splendors penned by Lord Byron.
At Scotturb, bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
You should also visit, to the north, the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fátima (Shrine), which is a site where apparitions of the Virgin Mary occurred, famous throughout the world.
Don't forget that, essentially, you are visiting a place that served as a mass grave and that is also a site of virtually invaluable significance to a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time in this place, and many more who had loved ones murdered or who worked there until their death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not deface the place by making marks or doing graffiti on the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. Approximately half of its people prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, since Catalan is, legally, the first language with official status, most signs are written in that language alone.
Even so, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other buildings.
While regular announcements on the Metro are only displayed in Catalan, unplanned interruptions are made in a wide variety of languages through an automatic program, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although it’s often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to have a good time in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like a well-mannered (well-educated) person. This will make getting around much easier.
A few polite gestures on your part will quickly dispel the Parisians’ seemingly rough manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded, mainly featuring beech, fir, and spruce trees, and exhibits vegetation ranging from alpine to Mediterranean.
It boasts a wide and extraordinary range of plant communities, thanks to the variety of microclimates, soils, and altitudes.
This region is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
The European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie are some of the exotic animals, among numerous other ordinary creatures, that can be found in the area.
During visits to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and may not have bare shoulders.
While almost all monasteries provide coats to women who arrive unprepared, if you bring your own, especially if it’s brightly colored, the monk or nun will smile at you at the entrance.
Following the same line of reasoning, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the garments available upon entry, but that clothing isn't washed after each person uses it, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
The gastronomy of Mallorca, like that of other similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in all its recipes.
Pa amb Oli is a popular and simple dinner, especially common in the summer. It’s bread with olive oil, tomato, and any other ingredient such as cheese or tuna, among others.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie" to mean 'you', always take an initial capital letter, even when located in the middle of a sentence.
It is a key method for distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
One could also say that it simplifies reading, although its writing is somewhat complex, as it is necessary to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used as a noun.
Pronouncing Italian is relatively easy, given that most of its words sound the same as they are written.
The letters c and g are the ones you need to pay the most attention to, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows them.
Likewise, be sure to respect the difference in the pronunciation of the single 'r' and the double 'rr'. For example, *caro* means expensive, while *carro* means automobile.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammatical rules and achieve a better understanding of sentences.
It goes without saying that if you are proficient in any Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak some Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is quite similar and that it is unnecessary to study it separately.
Currently, generally, premodern observatories have become obsolete and continue to function as museums or educational destinations.
Since, at their peak, light pollution wasn't a major issue as it is today, they are often found in cities or on campuses, being more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most current research telescopes consist of immense structures installed in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a traditional practice in Japan since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the plum blossom was most highly valued.
It was the Emperor of Japan who organized the first cherry blossom viewings, exclusively for himself and other members of the Imperial Court aristocracy.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to uproot “just one” specimen.
If you collect “specimens” during a visit to a formally organized garden, you will be expelled, no debate.
Generally, Singapore is a very safe place to be and very easy to get around; plus, you can buy almost any product from the moment you arrive.
However, due to its location in the “upper tropics,” just a few degrees north of the equator, you will always have to contend with the heat and, when the sky is clear, with the strong sun, which happens less frequently.
Additionally, some buses head north to Hebron, the site where, according to history, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives, are buried.
You should confirm that the bus you intend to board is going to Hebron and not just to Kyriat Arba, which is a Jewish neighborhood near there.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting destinations on the Danube, or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
For the Christian religion, Christmas is one of its most important holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.
There are numerous traditions related to this celebration that have also been adopted by non-believers from both Christian and non-Christian countries around the globe.
It is tradition to spend Easter night awake in an exposed location to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations of this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The most traditional churches typically offer an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, and congregations usually begin celebrations of Christ's resurrection as soon as midnight arrives.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came to this place by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because they are so far from the mainland, mammals were unable to reach them, which led to the giant tortoise becoming the main grazing creature in the Galapagos Islands.
Many mammal species have been introduced to the Galápagos Islands since humans arrived in the archipelago, such as, for example, goats, horses, and cattle, or rodents, dogs, and felines.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Since the sky will remain dark for most of the day, it's a great opportunity to observe the Northern Lights.
Thanks to the sparse population that resides in those regions and, as a result, the lack of light pollution, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
In Japan, workplace culture has a more hierarchical and formal structure than those from Western countries are likely accustomed to.
The typical attire in the business world is suits, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental, where group efforts are emphasized over focusing on praise for individual achievements.
Frequently, workers must have the approval of their superiors for decision-making and are expected to obey their instructions without question.
