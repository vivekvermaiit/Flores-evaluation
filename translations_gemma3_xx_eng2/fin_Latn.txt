This confirms a long-standing and widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but additionally provided information that is not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
According to researchers, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored underneath.
Additionally, the discovery helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, known as a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – such as barbs and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis is likely a later stage of evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren’t used for flight, but for thermoregulation or display purposes. Even though the sample was from a young dinosaur’s tail, researchers proposed it came from an adult individual’s plumage rather than a juvenile’s down.
Even though it was a tail from a young dinosaur, researchers proposed the sample originated from the plumage of an adult individual and not from the down of a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the main police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty people.

They realized that the Sun follows the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in their system was found to be due to luminosity and rotation and orbital motion, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less frequently a star experiences polarity reversals.

The work done was initially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to detect the effects of tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravity affects Earth causing tides, so too does the Milky Way's gravity affect the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy.
Researchers were able to deduce that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the galaxy's dark matter surrounds it in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

Voting in France has traditionally not been high-tech: voters go into a booth and place a pre-printed paper slip, on which they have marked their chosen candidate, into an envelope.
After the authorities have verified the voter’s identity, the voter drops the ballot envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter register.
French election law has determined the course of events with relative precision.
In 1988, ballot boxes were mandated to be transparent so that voters and observers could verify that no envelopes were inside the box at the start of voting and that no envelopes other than officially counted and authorized ballots were added to the box.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each stage of the proceedings. In the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision and following established procedures.

In her second competition, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting class with a combined time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 slower than the winning time of Austria's Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 slower than the time of Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's seated category were unable to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not receive a placement in the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant Superintendent D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused have been reported as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be compromised as his image has been widely published.
The practice is common elsewhere in Great Britain, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and courts have held that publication of images may be prejudicial to a fair trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee states that "journalists do seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish suspected photographs, etc."
The Crown Office, Scotland’s prosecuting authority with overall responsibility for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that it will not comment further on the matter, at least not before any indictment is made.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to run as they did before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to reports, other topics discussed included the status of holy Jerusalem for both nations in the future, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands continuous military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement. The Palestinian Authority only accepts such a presence for five years.
Forest rangers were supposed to closely monitor the hunters participating in the supplementary monitoring trial for pests, as the trial was being observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
Volunteers meeting the requirements were recruited as part of a joint initiative by the national park and wildlife service and the NSW branch of the Australian Shooting Federation, and as part of the shooting federation’s hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the acting director responsible for the protection of NPWS parks and cultural heritage, the four shooters selected for the initial culling received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Martelly recognized nine members at yesterday’s meeting of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth temporary electoral council in four years.
The delegation appointed by the President recommended the resignation of the previous interim electoral council last month as part of a package of measures intended to move the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasionally escalating into violence, the protests began due to unrealized elections, some of which were already scheduled to be held in 2011.
Overheating in malfunctioning iPods has been reported in approximately 60 cases, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of accidents involving 27 devices.
Last week, the ministry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating cases, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded to Apple's request to postpone the investigation as "truly unfortunate."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said that no damage had been reported on the island.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no indications of a tsunami having formed.
A former Filipino police officer is holding Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman when she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza died in a shootout.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research preterm birth in his spare time.
His/Her research showed that administering the hormone accelerates the development of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that an official investigation team found two black boxes, or flight recorders, on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also showed respect for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. A rather unique case, much like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I was… maybe even more so… I love her and I’m going to miss her… I hope she’s in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted before the 2010 federal parliamentary elections. The number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal parliamentary election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of the Department of Delivery asserted that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
34 percent of those surveyed shared his views and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the research, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but their fitness has been uncertain due to pain.
He hasn’t been able to take the medication needed for pain relief because its use is prohibited in the competitions.
Professor of computer science and mathematician Curtis Cooper at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery by the beginning of February using various devices and software, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, and specifically how Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo’s term as governor began earlier this year, and he signed a bill into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political jaw-flapping and laughable."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The US aviation authority claims that NextGen is a system that allows airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older technology based on ground-based radar. This allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more reliable information about their position.
No additional transport will be arranged and overland trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and park-and-ride services will also not be available at the match venue.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game might have to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published in Science magazine on Thursday reported the evolution of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that a new species had evolved in as few as two generations, despite the process previously being thought to take much longer. The reason was interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can also be rolled into very small objects.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted pictures in books, known as "book paintings".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make the indicator yourself using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the substance is.
The amount of hydrogen ions (pH of H) in the tested chemical indicates the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture from your hands reacts with the outermost layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of crust.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a complex drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets also existed. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where women and men bathed at the same time in the same spaces.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a phone call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space aboard a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
A gigantic rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. Much easier and faster movement is the greatest thing the bicycle has done for us.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other modes of transport.
Underneath them come medium-sized felines, which prey on medium-sized game ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Then there are also many small feline animals (including stray domestic cats) that eat small prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, of which there are far greater numbers.
The secret to their success is the so-called ecological niche. According to this concept, each feline has its own specific role, which is why it doesn't compete with others.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males, and sometimes up to thirty females and offspring.
Females are typically closely related to one another, forming large family groups of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave much like wolf or dog packs. These animals resemble lions in their behavior surprisingly much (but not other big cats), and they are also very dangerous to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not very well), swim, jump far, and pull five times as powerfully as a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus of big cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four feline species can roar.
The tiger's roar doesn't resemble the full-bodied roar of a lion, but rather a phrase composed of growls and shouted words.
Ocelots readily eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all animals hunted by an ocelot are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and locate edible animals – their prey – by sniffing the ground for their scent, following where they have travelled.
Ocelots can see very well in the dark thanks to their tapetum lucidum, and they move extremely stealthily. They hunt by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population it originated from (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or to a new island, making it difficult to return), its environment is often different than before.
The resources of a new environment are different, and the competitors are different, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different traits or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all, and still requires the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it will gradually look less and less like the main population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations appear so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe in, and they use carbon dioxide, which people breathe out.
Plants produce their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing other than other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws held over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and in addition to those, it had an extra row of teeth on its palate, so nothing that came its way could escape.
We are not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came near the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus rex wouldn't have stood a chance against it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own peculiar or unusual delicacies, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
As a second difference, the poor and women ate their meals while sitting on chairs, but the rich preferred to host communal feasts where they lounged on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have featured foods that only arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
They didn't have, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god’s home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests strove to fulfill the gods’ needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, known as the Holy of Holies, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built in temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house wasn't as important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
Women were cooking outside, and the shops were simply open stalls along the streets. Stone was used as the building material for the houses.
In Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived on the island at that time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was drawn on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though something has been written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4th, 1776" are written. The writing is upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ inches by 24 ½ inches) was initially rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the entry was added simply as a kind of name tag.
D-Day, or the landings and subsequent battles, had liberated Northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was under the control of so-called Vichy France, meaning the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the aggressors, rather than fighting against them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1944. The invasion's codename was Operation Dragoon.
American and Free French forces liberated Southern France in just two weeks and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people living and working together in cooperation, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civilian or citizen. It is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen or subject, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and in a way it also defines the size of a society.
City-states are predecessors to nations. Civilized culture refers to the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next, a long-lasting cultural legacy, and a considerable extent of distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving sufficient historical evidence, and therefore are generally not considered proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government – consisting only of Congress – based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it had to rely on the often uncooperative authorities of the states in the enforcement of all its regulations.
It also had no power to alter tax laws and tariffs between states.
Amending the articles required unanimous approval from all states, and the states were so arrogant towards the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world, alongside the German national team. It won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in them even in international matches and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the world's seventh-largest island country!
Because the islands of Japan are in a cluster or group, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan began to be known as early as the 15th century, when European sailors passing by mentioned the island, using the name Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island."
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624. It simultaneously initiated a change in the indigenous population’s agricultural methods and hired Chinese laborers for its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the military forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
Having suffered a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: these are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been restored to give tourists a better understanding of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common size worldwide for still photography is 35mm. It was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced, but above all, digital camera image sensor formats have inherited its aspect ratio.
Slightly confusingly, a 35 millimeter size is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, this aspect ratio (when divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
Often misused and much ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism in an image while still maintaining some order.
According to that, the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, began to be closely scrutinized.
Christianity had united the countries of Europe for over a thousand years, despite differences in languages and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone, both kings and commoners.
One of the core principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s financial resources are intended for just such use.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and wealth led many to question the implementation of doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital supply lines to soldiers and civilians, even though the siege violated generally accepted international law, as codified by numerous international treaties over the preceding two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire ocean areas and caused danger even to neutral vessels.
Because the tactic only provoked limited reactions, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations decided to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to accept a job at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way to depict different periods: each stage of China or each ruling family had its own dynasty.
Additionally, between each dynasty there was a period of unstable fragmentation of provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely in their pursuit of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for the right to sit on the highest seat in the magnificent palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, the rise of nationalism, and a belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions also became open to all male applicants. Thus, the most ambitious and successful were able to prosper.
The same applied to the army, as military ranks were now based on competence rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond everyday life. He often went to meditate in a cave, which became known as Hira and was located on Mount Nur, meaning “mountain of light.”
The cave itself, which the tooth of time has left undisturbed, creates a very vivid impression of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on one of the mountains rising north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's very difficult to find, even knowing it exists. Once inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
Only a clear, beautiful sky is visible above, and many surrounding mountains. Very little of the earthly world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
On the Giza plateau in Egypt’s Valley of the Dead, also known as the Giza necropolis, lie several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous small burial chambers, several temples, and the Great Sphinx of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 2nd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
Located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, the Giza Plateau – also known as the Giza necropolis – includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
The sign for a rising arc looks like a V, and the sign for a falling arc is like a nail or a square missing its bottom line.
A rising draw means you should start from the tip and push the bow. A falling draw means you should start from the fross (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A rising bow typically produces a softer sound, while a falling bow is stronger and more assertive.
You are free to add your own markings in pencil, but please remember that the printed ties are in the music for musical reasons, and should generally be followed.
A crowd composed of working-class women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister Elisabeth, to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in carriages, surrounded by a crowd shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, someone from the crowd waved the head of a guardsman murdered at Versailles in front of the shocked queen.
Filipinos were forced to pay the war costs incurred by American imperialism from the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial administration, which covered a significant portion of the costs, and to service the interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
The fundamental benefit of US imperialism, of course, consisted of the enormous profits gained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the Knights Templar, one needs to understand the context in which the organization arose.
The period of these events is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between the years 1000 and 1300 AD.
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and then came the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that practically encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the so-called "push" of technology – the necessity of technology – to the absolute belief that human destiny is guided by the logic based on scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common basic ideas: first, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and second, that technology in turn has effects on societies that are more intrinsic than socially conditioned.
As an example, one could argue that the invention of the car inevitably leads to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars leads to more accidents in road traffic, which in turn leads to the invention of new healthcare methods to repair damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a significant ingredient in Romanticism and was drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was considered to shape individuals. Over time, customs and culture typical of this geographical location developed. Because these were in harmony with society, they functioned better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of Europe in the feudal era, just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
Its position declined in the 12th century mainly because Crusaders had returned home with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
Just at that moment, the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
Due to slow communication channels, styles in Western Europe could be 25–30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era was people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes, thanks to the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is the cultivation of enough food to feed only the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficiency is a simple system, often based on organic principles, that utilizes seeds native to the eco-region combined with crop rotation or other relatively straightforward methods to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel rejected by societal norms, and in doing so, they are able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as its own and as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, related to gender or sexuality, geographical, or a combination of several different factors.
Members of subcultures often communicate their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and their own slang.
One of the most common methods of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use as examples those rare unfortunate children who, while growing up, lacked the socialization provided by adults due to neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse.
Children like these are called "wild". Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents). In some cases, abandonment has been due to parents rejecting a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have lived independently in nature.
If a feral child has been raised entirely by an animal other than a human, they will behave – within the limits of their physical capabilities – almost identically to their animal caregiver, for example, demonstrating the same fear or indifference towards humans.
The purpose of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more engaging. Timely support for learning (scaffolding) goes even further.
Ladders are not a learning method, but a support tool that assists individuals in a new learning experience, such as learning to use new computer software or starting a new project.
Ladders can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is the little paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software, and its purpose is to pose questions, provide prompts, and explain procedures that the learner might have found too challenging without assistance.
Children are placed in foster homes for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and supportive, but some do.
We consider the foster care system a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, consistent education, and reliable healthcare.
The purpose of the children's placement is to address all the basic needs they lacked in their previous homes.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the internet signify additional dimensions in the case of the use-value theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important influences on Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new perspectives on motives when examining audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
It has been specifically claimed that correctly interpreting microexpressions can allow one to identify whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks described in his article, "The President's Speech," how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
She even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation increases new genetic variation, selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination transfer variation back and forth between these two reservoirs with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human has difficulty obtaining enough amino acids from the plants available on the savanna.
Furthermore, lacking them has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant-based resources would have been the proteins from leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest without cooking.
Instead, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digestible, and in addition, it provides abundant amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Therefore, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees on the savannas do today.
Sleep interruption refers to intentionally waking up during a normal sleep cycle and falling back asleep a short time later (10–60 minutes later).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but doesn’t fully wake you up.
If you notice yourself turning off your alarm while still asleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known as a diuretic) before bedtime, thus forcing you to get up during the night to urinate.
The amount of a person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive his life force is. It is possible for everyone to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but to them were added the concept of the Mahayana, or the Great Vehicle, as well as many techniques from Indian yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Visualizing deities purifies energy channels, activates chakras, and develops awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which is why the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated. After the war, clashes of systems, procedures, and cultures led to a breakdown in relations between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and a war was genuinely fought, as proxy armies battled on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Polish defenses had already collapsed by September 17, 1939, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost entirely nullified overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced into the country and established fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after attacking eastern Poland. This was in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and others – both bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional task of navies has been to ensure their own country retains the ability to move its own people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy’s ability to do the same.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy mostly tried to prevent this traffic with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain just as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Tame goats were typically raised in herds that roamed hilly terrain or other pastures. Often, they were cared for by goat herders, who were frequently children or young people, much like the more well-known sheep herders. These herding methods are still in use today.
Tramways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and with heavier loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Railway ties were put into use quite early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the rails would be more efficient if there was a strip of iron on top of them.
The practice became common, but the iron wore down the wagons’ wooden wheels more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. People began walking upright two million years ago, when Homo erectus (meaning upright man) evolved.
The Australopithecus that preceded it did not walk upright as consistently.
Evidence of specialization for bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering somewhat.
This is often like treating the symptoms of an illness, but if we don't want just a temporary fix, we should find the root causes of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to humanity’s scientific and technological advancements, and problems have grown due to overpopulation and humanity’s wasteful lifestyle.
After Congress approved it on July 4th, the handwritten copy, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
During the night, 150–200 copies were printed, which are now known as Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon read the document aloud in public for the first time in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. One copy reached London by August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds contain a lot of all sorts of things that still look like terrible lizards.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
In practice, all currently used computers are based on processing information coded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits – or, in the professional jargon of computer circuits, bits.
Internal poisoning is not necessarily immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made right away.
The most reliable sign of internal poisoning is a visible, open medicine bottle or a container holding poisonous household chemicals.
See the first aid instructions for that poison on the label.
Entomologists use the term "bugs" specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the fact that bed bugs used to be very common. Bed bugs are insects that are well adapted to being parasites of humans.
Fleas and bedbugs are both nest-dwelling, adapted to live in their host's nest or cocoon.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in the best interests of either themselves or the child.
These couples can, if they wish, draw up an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to act as the child's parents.
The primary task of science is to determine, using scientific methods, how the world works. The scientific method guides the vast majority of scientific research.
However, it is not only about conducting experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were accepted, including in the field of psychology.
As proficiency in the Greek language declined in the West, it lost contact with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in body structure and behavior often depend very essentially on the existence of internally generated cycles and their creation through biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms that are not merely reactions to external seasonal stimuli have been observed in most living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue a cyclical operation for a certain period even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's research was one of the most important pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, either labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have several different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important a part of the genome they have affected, and whether they have affected germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations that occur in germ cells can be inherited by offspring, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural destinations with the purpose of enjoying the scenery – including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities in the travel destination include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and learning about information concerning the ecosystem.
As one example, one could mention visiting Bornean orangutans, learning from them, and photographing them.
Every morning, residents of small rural towns drive to work, and encounter others whose workplace is where they themselves came from.
In such a dynamic shuttle system, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a traffic system based on private cars.
Science now offers indications that a massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so much complaint, why do they fail daily? Are traffic planners simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is research that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, as the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Luckily, drivers behave relatively consistently. Therefore, traffic flows generally have a reasonably good coherence and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To better describe traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships helps in road design, planning, and maintenance.
Insects were among the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their bodies.
This way they have access to a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and damselflies are currently the only insects unable to fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite – that the entire Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems sensible, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the world's second longest and largest river. It contains over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, reaching a width of 6 miles at its widest point.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from land into the oceans originates in the Amazon.
The actual length of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or construction skill of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the world’s smallest independent state and the smallest state in the world by population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Most of those working for the state also speak Italian in their everyday lives, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known common chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they all occur naturally in their pure form and because they are also relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of a combination of one or more elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled more the four states of matter – solid, liquid, gas, and plasma – in that order, but he also theorized that they transformed into other substances to create what we see.
Metal alloys are fundamentally mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many upon its arrival on the market.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods have developed, the value and uses of the pencil have become more neglected.
Nowadays, messages are written on a computer screen, and you never have to search for a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard once something newer appears on the scene.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus consisting of many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy once more.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which is why they are prone to decay with even a slight or non-existent nudge.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust. The Moon's outermost layer is called its crust.
The thickness of the Moon's crust is about 70 kilometers on the side facing Earth and about 100 kilometers on the far side of the Moon.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker on the highlands.
Darker areas of the seafloor may be more prevalent because the crust is thinner there, allowing lava to rise to the surface more easily.
Content theories primarily focus on investigating what lies behind people's behavior or what appeals to them.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they mature.
These theories examine why some people want what they want, and what things in their environment lead them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When leaders start leading former peers, two distinct patterns of behavior generally emerge. At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
A leader like this struggles to make unpopular decisions, maintain discipline, evaluate performance, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the group has done and make it their own.
The leader is ultimately responsible for the group’s successes and failures.
Such behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to deliver the same level of quality as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members act as liaisons to their immediate physical teams.
They often have more decision-making power than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones and their local management may not always understand this.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique components of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team to which all members report. The invisible team determines each member's performance level.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process required to establish a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing systematic learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across all operating departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, the process where an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that serves customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create an innovative culture, as well as share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes a continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying consciousness, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The increasing availability of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This way we can gather a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
In artificial intelligence research, the goal is to enable machines to perform tasks automatically that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include supervision, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have developed into distinct fields of study focused on providing solutions to real-world problems.
Nowadays, artificial intelligence is often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and national defense, just as it is included as a built-in feature in numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
School trips are an important part of education. Often, the teacher would like to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution – virtual field trips. Students can view museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting at their desks.
Sharing a class trip virtually is a great way to reminisce about it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website documenting their trip to the state capital. The site is updated annually, but its older versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. In the early stages of students’ blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often careless, but the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to take care to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to better grasp the world around them." The need to feed the readers’ interest encourages students to be clever and engaging (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their positions against the backdrop of others’ writings as well as bring their own perspectives to bear on the question at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, boasting a wealth of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north is, among other things, the pristine, scenic Muskoka.
These and many other factors create the impression of Ontario as a place that outsiders see as the heir apparent to Canada.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The following demographic comparison may surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are total citizens in Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest of them and, due to its nature, is like a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France, and they are known as luxurious beach destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them to these lands, and it gained a strong foothold in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women – All female travelers, regardless of their actual marital status, are advised to say they are married.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to things they might experience as harassment. It’s not uncommon for someone to follow, grab an arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't justify unwanted advances!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 9th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city, naming it Dar-ul-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in Morocco.
It’s easy to find places in the old medina selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide variety of trinkets, but all of it is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the city center.
Goma is reasonably safe, but all trips outside the city require prior investigation to ascertain the current situation of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and you can find some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trackers in Africa there.
To get around in Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). A typical (local) fare is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
When this is combined with its relatively difficult location, "Timbuktu" has begun to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is a impoverished town, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 due to the threat posed by encroaching desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates’s PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is a stark contrast to the country's other cities, as it has more of an Arab than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km², and it is divided into 14 different nature zones, each of which supports a different range of wildlife and vegetation.
It is one of South Africa’s main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
A daily conservation and entrance fee is charged in the park, as is the case in all national parks in South Africa.
It may be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to either some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name, and it is a prime destination for many tourists.
The procession of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shimmering column chart, best seen reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To experience the best of Hong Kong, you need to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront area directly opposite.
The majority of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is located on reclaimed land densely built up along the north shore.
It was precisely this location that British colonial masters embraced, and if one seeks signs of the area’s colonial history, it’s a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest area. It stretches 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located on the Indian side is called Sundarban National Park.
However, forests are not simply mangrove swamps, but include some of the last remnants of the magnificent jungles that once covered the entire Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that it currently holds 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer.
Buses depart from the inter-municipal bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakari and Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Because local buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase your ticket a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese Coaster buses run, which are comfortable and solidly built.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes each 3.5 meters wide.
The underpass height of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, around the time the Brazilian border stations are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant of the indigenous groups who inhabited the area of present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, but also practiced subsistence farming.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous tribes lived, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indians," emerged in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the country’s indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonial period, which lasted three hundred years.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for its world-class polo teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen during other seasons.
You can get news about tournaments and ticket purchasing locations for polo matches from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at a one-to-one rate with the British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley as well.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although British and American currencies may be accepted. Find out the accepted payment method by asking the owners in advance.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is almost impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, and temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reading.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities advise staying at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wildlife.
Bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, even if they may seem very docile.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Please also keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing strongly scented foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In the harbor, a notorious standoff between fleets occurred in 1889, when seven vessels – German, American, and British – refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. At the same time, nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering held in the city led to the murder of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches there, as Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three different areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour suburb) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches safe for swimming, and pohutukawa trees provide shade for most.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland, in the Waitemata Harbour.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches, and the shoreline is lined with a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are several French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but those who prefer it can easily find bottled water.
The idea of a flat white-style milk coffee is foreign to Australians. A small black coffee is known as an espresso, and cappuccino is served with a large amount of whipped cream instead of frothed milk. Tea is served without milk.
Cocoa meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are organized to the reef throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of these causes are rare on the reef.
Therefore, heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found north of 1770 near beaches and river mouths from October to April. They can occasionally be encountered at other times as well.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and will likely swim away.
Estuarine crocodiles don't actually live in the sea, but their primary habitat is the estuaries from Rockhampton northwards.
When a traveler books in advance, they have peace of mind knowing they will have somewhere to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals on specific hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation through a travel agency, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation valid if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, all changes and requests should first be directed through the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, a large majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on the festival grounds, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even after the main stage music performances have ended, there may be places at the festival where music continues to be played late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea during winter, check the location of your cabin, as travelling through the ice can create a truly awful noise in the worst parts.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the time and money customers spend. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and finding the exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep customers happy – and within the casino premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or in mountainous areas should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or extremely cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there’s little friction, and you can’t drive the same way you would on asphalt.
During a blizzard, snow can fall so quickly that a car can get stuck.
Snowfall or wind-blown snow, as well as moisture or ice accumulated on vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally operates year-round without interruptions.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest attraction and for many, the highlight of their visit.
Traditionally, the word "safari" refers to overland travel with the purpose of observing Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment is sufficient for observing them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as bushwalking, hiking safari, and trekking) refers to a hike lasting either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, your situation may be difficult.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies based on coronavirus did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to be held.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with tickets typically costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels offer the possibility to borrow an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room itself.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't particularly mind unsocked socks, you can try a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as it may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have any doubts, you should consider buying water from a reputable company in sealed bottles.
Tourists may encounter pests they are not accustomed to back home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, and transmit diseases.
Genuine infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people violently are generally not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means the possibility to purchase products in certain places that are exempt from excise and sales tax.
Tourists heading to countries with heavy taxation may sometimes save substantial amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont experiences the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh Highway, as it repeatedly traverses remote, forested terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: you'll encounter many steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
Designated speed limits are considerably lower than on earlier and later sections – typically 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 kilometers per hour) – and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Strangely enough, cell phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are particularly rich and diverse, resembling the pastries of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries are made year-round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often taste particularly good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you're craving small but hearty pastries, try one that, depending on the region, is known as a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, typically served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries. In South India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is typically used.
Since there are 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a wide range of regional food cultures throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further specification, it generally refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, and includes a large selection of simply seasoned dishes. Popular Javanese flavors include peanuts, chilies, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for a rider’s feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
The rider gains more stability from them, but they can pose safety concerns as the rider’s feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the bolting horse may drag them along. To reduce this risk, various precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders use riding boots with a heel, which have a smooth and rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls on it backwards.
Cochamón Valley – Chile’s top climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America. The valley features a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
From the peaks, there are breathtaking views. Climbers arriving from all over the world are constantly creating new routes on its endless walls.
Skiing and snowboarding, which are downhill sports, are popular sports where people descend snowy slopes using skis or a snowboard attached to their feet.
Downhill skiing is an important tourism activity, and many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," plan entire vacations around it in a specific location.
Skiing is a very old idea – cave paintings depicting skiers have been made as early as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport traces its roots back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski mountaineering, or touring skiing.
It's related to alpine skiing-style touring or mountaineering, but it doesn't usually include that, as the latter is practiced on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as if it were a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can progress somewhat faster than on foot, but you will very rarely achieve the same speed as when skiing on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean filling out visa applications and going through passport checks many times.
However, the Schengen Area functions in this respect somewhat like a single state.
As long as you remain in this area, you can usually cross the border without being subjected to another passport control.
When you have a Schengen visa, you also don't need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, thus saving you time, money, and the hassle of paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define anything over one hundred years old as antique.
The definition varies depending on geographical location. For example, in North America, newer objects are considered antique than in Europe.
Handicraft products may be defined as antiques, even if they are newer than comparable mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture associated with it is also important to many practitioners of other professions.
However, not all Sámi people have traditionally participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but have instead lived off fishing, hunting, and similar livelihoods, keeping reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Currently, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If there is a travel advisory in effect for your country of visit, it may affect your travel health insurance and trip cancellation insurance.
Perhaps it would be worth asking for advice from other countries as well as your own, even if their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
As one example, Americans may encounter different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The reports are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, generalized, and overly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Dangerous weather is a general term for all hazardous weather phenomena that may cause damage, serious societal disruption, or loss of life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it comes in different types that can depend on geography, landforms, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are dangerous forms and consequences of weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Dangerous weather regional and seasonal phenomena include blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the threat of dangerous weather affecting their destination, as it may impact travel plans.
Everyone who wants to visit a country interpretable as a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Awareness Training" will likely return the address of a local company.
On the course, all the topics covered here are usually discussed in much more detail, and generally in connection with practical experience.
The course typically lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications covering war zones are scarce.
Travellers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports without a gender marker (X), or to update documents to reflect a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not had surgery should not be assumed to pass through security scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the shore. They are often found on reefs or similar locations.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow concentrates in a few deeper areas, where rapid currents to the deep water can form.
Most deaths are a result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you're out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere you won’t get swept away by the current again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been noticed, it might be wise to wait for rescuers.
Reverse culture shock hits sooner than culture shock (the adjustment phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the customs of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need time to adjust to a new country.
People don't necessarily realize that patience and understanding are also important for returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and before the performance begins, they can be seen in complete silence.
Usually, one always hears the voices of tourists and merchants. The story of light and sound is just like a fairytale.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Many nations have claimed the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and as a result, they have the most bases. In 2020, there were sixteen active bases.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the mainland. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the crater of a still-active volcano filled with water serves as a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea, south of the peninsula.
The Niemimaan Mountains merge there into the plain and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or on the Sentinel Range, are located the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where mobile phones have no coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because to make a call you need to be outdoors and have an unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is often used in maritime applications, including on pleasure craft. Similarly, it is used by expeditions that need remote data and audio connections.
Your local phone service provider is likely able to give you more information about connecting to that service.
Traveling and learning are an increasingly popular option among those planning a gap year.
It is particularly popular among those graduating from school, as they can take a gap year before university without their education suffering.
In many cases, participating in a gap year course abroad can even improve your chances of continuing higher education studies in your home country.
Typically, a course fee is charged for participating in these tutorials.
Finland is an excellent boating destination. The land of thousands of lakes also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and along the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and on lakes you don't necessarily need a boat the size of a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any boats, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different kind of experience.
Boating is a common leisure activity in Finland, where there are boats for every seven or eight people.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (for example, the figure in the Netherlands is one in forty).
Most regular Baltic Sea cruises include a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit the historical city for a few days and still return to the ship to sleep at night.
You do not need a separate visa if you only visit the countries on excursions arranged by the ship (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As seen in the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or experienced something traumatic.
There’s no reason to be ashamed of it: it doesn’t differ from the fears and aversions many other people have towards certain things.
For some people, a basic understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during a flight may help overcome fear stemming from ignorance or feelings of helplessness.
Transportation companies are well-compensated for fast deliveries. Often, speed is very important for companies' documents, merchandise, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Larger companies already have their own planes on some routes, but on other routes and for smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they shipped the goods by air freight, on some routes unloading and customs clearance could take days.
The only way to get the goods through faster was to send it as registered baggage. Airline regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, so we need you at this stage.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay a large stack of money for the privilege (or perhaps let your company do it for you).
However, it doesn't come cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the price for business class compared to economy, and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally, it's not even worth looking for discounts on business or first class seats for direct flights from place A to place B.
Airlines know that there is a certain core group of air travelers who are willing to pay a fortune to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
The conflict led to the declaration of independence of the Transnistrian Republic, located in eastern Moldova, in 1994. It has its own administration and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have re-emerged between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Moldova's main religion is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey. Its population is around 3.7 million, it is the country's second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, surrounded by mountains and spreading around a vast bay.
Amidst wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers, there are traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century square, and old mosques and churches, although the city’s atmosphere resembles the Mediterranean Europe more than traditional Turkey.
In Haldarsvík there is an unusual octagonal church, and the village offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy.
There are interesting dove sculptures on top of some gravestones in the cemetery.
It's worth spending half an hour strolling around the charming village.
From there to the north and easily accessible is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra. Foreigners came to know it from Lord Byron’s laudatory description, in which he depicted its splendour.
ScottUrbin bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the northern direction, it is also worth visiting the large Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, which is world-famous for the apparition of Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and a site whose significance to a substantial portion of the world’s population is almost immeasurable.
Still alive are many men and women who survived being there, and many others whose loved ones were murdered there or forced to work themselves to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Remember to treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place by drawing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only marked in Catalan, as it is the first official language according to law.
Yet Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
The metro's regular announcements are only in Catalan, but the automatic system announces unexpected disruptions in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Even though it’s often just a baseless stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to be as polite as possible and behave like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-bred). It makes getting around much easier.
The brusque exterior of Parisians quickly fades if you show ordinary politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has a lot of forest, mainly beech, spruce, and pine trees, and its vegetation is a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
There is a remarkably diverse range of plant communities due to the variety of microclimates, varying soils, and differences in altitude.
The area is also home to an incredibly large variety of different animal and bird species.
In addition to more common species, you can encounter rare wildlife there, such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and black grouse.
Women visiting monasteries should wear skirts that cover their knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
But if you bring your own headscarf, especially a brightly colored one, you might get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men also need to be dressed in trousers that reach below the knee.
You can borrow those from the clothing selection at the entrance, but they aren't washed after every use, so you might not feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil and tomato, plus any available topping, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, and additionally the word "Sie" (meaning "you" – formal), always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish certain verbs from nouns.
It can also make reading easier, although it complicates writing due to the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
It is important to pay the most attention to the letters C and G, as their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Also remember to pronounce r and rr differently. Caro means beloved, carro wagons.
Persian grammar is quite easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help in learning many things about Persian grammar and improve sentence comprehension.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese is easier.
However, those with a little knowledge of Spanish might initially imagine that Portuguese is so close that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, old observatories are generally no longer used for their original purpose, but have been converted into museums or learning environments.
Because light pollution wasn’t the same problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, and are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities, and they are located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea originated in China, where the most popular flower was the Japanese apricot.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom viewing parties exclusively for himself and other members of the influential aristocracy within the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" as a sample.
If you operate in an official and well-maintained garden, you’ll be kicked out for collecting “samples” without any fuss.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, and it’s very easy to find your way around. You can buy almost anything after arriving.
But being in the heart of the tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to endure both the heat (always) and intense sunshine (when the sky is clear, which happens less often).
Additionally, a few buses run to northern Hebron, traditionally believed to be the burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you intend to board also goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good theme around which to plan a vacation.
For example, a visit to the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube, or boating on the Erie Canal.
They also regulate the flow of traffic on popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important religious holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated on Jesus' birthday.
Also, non-believers and non-Christians in Christian countries around the world have adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
According to tradition, Easter Eve is spent awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold their Easter Vigil mass on Saturday evening of the Easter weekend. The congregation often bursts into celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals originally arriving on the island came there by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because the mainland was very far away, mammals were unable to survive the journey, so the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
After humans arrived on the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark for almost all hours of the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore not a problem, you can also admire the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are common work attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is absolutely essential. Teamwork is emphasized over individual achievements.
Employees often need to get their manager’s approval for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow the manager’s instructions without question.
