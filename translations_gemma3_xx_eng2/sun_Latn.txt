This is not just confirming that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has spread, but it can’t show enough fossil detail, like color and its 3-dimensional structure.
The scientist stated that the animal’s feathers were chestnut brown on top but yellow or carotenoid on the underside.
That research provides insight into the molting process of birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possessed other feather characteristics – hooks and barbules – researchers conclude that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they weren't used for flight but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers suggest that, although this is a dinosaur tail, this example shows that adult feathers were not like chicken feathers.
Researchers depict that, although this is a young dinosaur’s tail, the sample shows bird-like feathers and is not a juvenile.

The work is mostly theoretical, but the program was created for simulating research conducted on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team will be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of that galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational pull on Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around galaxies is located around a single galaxy in the form of a halo, and is then composed of many small particles.

In France, elections don't really use much technology: those who want to vote go into a booth, take a paper with the names of the candidates on it, and then put it into an envelope.
After the officer verifies the voter's identity, the voter inserts the ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Candidates may send representatives to witness each stage of the process. Yesterday, food was delivered by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific rules.

The names of those who are defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki told the defendant to cover his face in court.
Even though there were three people inside the car when it crashed, no one was injured.
But, the driver suffered a severe head injury.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed, and emergency services are extricating the driver from the red Audi TT.
She initially received treatment at the James Paget Hospital in the Greater Yarmouth area.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeyinka has been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with murdering his son.
He is currently being detained and awaiting charges and trial, but eyewitness testimony is somewhat clouded because his image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in England, but the Scottish courts operate differently and the courts consider the publication of photos potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted, "Journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when distributing photos of suspects, etc."
The Mahkota office, which is in charge of prosecution, has informed reporters that there will be no further comment until the indictment.
That document, according to leaked reports, will relate to border negotiations, which Palestine desires based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered in the reporting also include the situation of future times from the sacred Jerusalem for both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is accused of continuing its military presence in the West Bank for ten years after the agreement was signed when the PA agreed to end the military presence for only five years.
The shooter in the additional pest control trial must be closely supervised by security personnel, because the trial is monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
In partnership between NPWS and the Australian Shooting Sports Association (NSW) Inc., volunteers meeting the requirements are recruited under the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director of Park and Heritage Protection and NOWS, the 4 shooters who have been selected for the first shooting operation have received security briefings and have also been trained.
Martelly inaugurated the Temporary Election Commission (CEP) consisting of nine people yesterday.
This is CEP Martelly’s fifth time in 4 years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of CEP Saacanna as part of a package of measures to advance the country in the upcoming elections.
The commission is Martelly's response to the anti-regime protests that spread in October.
Protests, sometimes accompanied by violence, were triggered by failures to hold general elections, some of which have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating and failing iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and resulting in four people sustaining minor burn injuries.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last Sunday, METI announced Apple had reported additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report delay "deeply regrettable."
The plane carrying Mariana crashed at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 AM GMT on Friday).
The Marianas Utara (Northern Mariana Islands) emergency management office reports that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also states that there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer was arrested for allegedly hijacking a bus full of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot an M16 rifle at tourists.
Several people have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released unharmed, along with a Filipino photographer.
The photographers were chasing a woman who was already old because she had to go to the water. Mendoza died from being shot.
Liggins follows in his father's footsteps, working in the field of medicine.
She studied to become an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While she worked at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in her free time.
Her research indicates that administering hormones will accelerate fetal lung maturation in newborns.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered 2 flight recorders, or 'black boxes', on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also gave her respect.
Tommy Dreamer says, "Luna is the first extreme queen. My first boss. Luna left on a two-month night. Unique like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels mentioned that "Luna is as strange as I am... perhaps even more... I love her and will miss her very much... I hope you are in a better place."
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent from 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia would become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of people in the poll held this opinion, namely wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch in Australia.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia cannot become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, their physical fitness is in doubt.
He won't be able to take the medication he needs to overcome the pain because it's prohibited during the Competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people have confirmed the discovery using hard drives and different software since the beginning of February. It was revealed on Tuesday.
Comets might be a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth in the past.
Suomo, 53 years old, began his administration earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
She/He called the rumor "political chatter and jokes."
He/She is rumored to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the FAA to be able to allow aircraft to fly with shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while also reducing carbon emissions.
This utilizes satellite-based technology as an alternative to older land-based radar technology to manage air traffic, to show the position of aircraft more clearly and to provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no more rides attached to the elevated train that will stop at Wembley, and then car parking and attractions are unavailable on the field.
The fear of a lack of transportation increases the possibility that the match will be forced to be held behind closed doors without support from the team's fans.
Research published on Thursday in the Science Journal reported the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report a new species that evolved in only two generations, even though this process typically takes a very long time, due to breeding between the native Darwin’s finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of forms. It can also be rolled into small shapes.
This can be drawn into thin wire, which can be spun and knitted. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made thinner and then attached to other metals. This can be made very thin, almost to the point of being used for decorating hand-painted images in books, or what are called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a chemical pH indicator. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (chemical base) of the substance.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that releases an electron (because a hydrogen atom originally consists of one proton and one electron).
Combine the 2 dry powders together, then, using clean but wet hands, knead until it forms a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel sticky and form a small shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every home, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found at the settlements in the cities of Minoa in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were found in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were placed in the same area.
If you are contacting someone very far away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in outer space received a phone call and then quickly forwarded that phone call down.
That satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
A rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to be stored on a satellite or telescope in outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The biggest thing the wheel and we have done is make transportation more accessible and more efficient.
This has led us to find trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
Underneath that is a medium-sized cat that preys on medium-sized animals such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there were many small cats (including pets) and more small animals than reptiles, like toads, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the niche concept, a specific craft possessed by cats almost eliminating competition from others.
Lions are cats that most enjoy being social, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult males, and around thirty females and their young.
Women usually have close relationships with others, in the form of large families from female siblings and female children.
A lion's ferocity isn't much different from a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are similar to lions (but not like other big cats) in behavior, and just as dangerous to their prey.
An athlete who is incredibly flexible, a tiger capable of climbing (though not gracefully), swimming, leaping over vast distances, and biting with the strength of 5 strong men.
Tigers are closely related (Genus Panthera) to lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar isn't impressive, it's like the roar of a large lion, but more similar to the sound of an old sentence.
Ocelots are fond of preying on small animals. They will eat monkeys, rodents, crawling animals, and birds if they can. Almost all animals preyed upon by ocelots are smaller than their own size.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt other animals for food, sniffing and digging where those other animals have passed.
That animal can move stealthily in the dark using night vision, and can also stalk its prey very slowly. The ocelot hunts its prey by blending into its surroundings and then ambushing it.
When a small group of living beings (small population) are separated from their main population of origin (such as moving across mountains or rivers, or if moving to a new island so it's not easy to return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from before.
This new environment has different raw materials and different enemies, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than the old one.
The original population won't change at all, they will still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to appear to be steadily declining like other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, 2 populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and the most important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, humans breathe out).
Plants process food and utilize sunlight through photosynthesis, and plants also respire.
We build houses and make clothes from plants. Almost all the food we eat also comes from plants. If there were no plants, animals couldn't live.
Mosasaurus was the primary predator of its time; it feared nothing, except other Mosasaurs.
Its length fills more than 70 teeth that are tightly closed, and an additional set on the roof of its mouth, which means there is no way out for anything that crosses its path.
We don't know for sure, but it seems its tongue is forked. Its food included turtles, large fish, mosasaurs, and possibly even cannibalism.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; even dinosaurs like T. rex are no match.
Although most of their guests are poor people for us, the Romans had guests at strange or unusual feasts, including clowns, peacocks, snails, and rodents called beurit.
The difference was when poor people and elderly women sat on chairs, while the wealthy enjoyed feasts together and would lie down while eating.
The ancient Romans could not introduce crops that came from America or Asia to Europe in the following centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or coconuts, and there were no ancient Romans who had ever tried turkey.
The Babylonians built main temples for each god and considered them the god's home.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests will strive to fulfill the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and a sheltered area that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes, several towers that have a pyramid-like shape are called ziggurats. Ziggurats were built as part of a temple.
The peak of my prayers is a special place for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not very important to them.
The circumcision of the Hebrew family happened in an open space.
The wife is cooking in the yard; the shops are just stalls facing the street. Stones are used to build houses.
Because there weren't any extensive forests in the land of Canaan, the price of wood was very expensive.
Greenland gets its name from its inhabitants. Nordic tales recount that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and while wandering west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
But aside from his discovery, the Eskimo people had indeed already settled in that place since that time.
Even though all those countries are 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, rulers, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve already seen the movie National Treasure, you’ll probably think there’s a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Nangning, that isn’t right. Even though there’s writing on the back of the document, that isn’t a treasure map.
On the typewriter used to draft the Declaration of Independence, there is writing that says "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is embossed underneath the document, reversed.
Even though there isn't a single person who knows for sure who wrote it, it is understood that in its early life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) had been rolled up for postponement.
So, it seems that notation was added only as a label.
The D-Day landing and the subsequent battles successfully liberated northern France, but not the south yet.
They were governed by French "Vichy". They were French people who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the colonizers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked Southern France, that attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French Liberation forces freed Southern France, then they returned to Germany.
Civilization is a culture that belongs to a group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin language, namely *civilis* which means civil, it is related to the Latin word *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or a part of a city-state, and truly, how that meaning can be interpreted as encompassing all of the society that is being discussed.
The city-state is a pioneer of the nation. A culture of civilization implies the continuation of knowledge for several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often perish without leaving historical evidence and fail to be recognized as deserving civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states established a first, weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress does not have the power to enforce taxes, and because there is no national executive or judiciary, it depends on the authority of the states, which are often uncooperative, to enforce any of its actions.
That also doesn't have the authority to deviate from tax regulations and inter-state fees.
Those articles require absolute ratification from all state governments before they can be amended, and state governments often take the central government lightly, causing their representatives to frequently be absent.
The Indonesian national team defeated Italy, and the German national team are two of the most successful national teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
The popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern region, and Italy participates in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because of the collection/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, in geographical terms, as an "archipelago".
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and recorded the island's name as Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East Indies established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes to the indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to develop rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan one of the provinces of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu was built with 3 main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Temple.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of how they originally looked.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been excavated and then leveled until today.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm. This represents a dominant film size very similar to the analog film era.
This is still being developed up to now, but the most important aspect of its logic has been inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is a bit confusing, because its width is 36mm and its height is 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this shape (divided by twelve almost equaling the simplest whole number ratio) is reportedly 3:2.
Many common formats (like APS format and its companions) are the same or similar to this aspect ratio.
The rules that are very restrictive and often ridiculed are simply guidelines for creating dynamism while maintaining proportions in an image.
This indicates that the best place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three vertical and horizontal sections (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, already wealthy and powerful, was closely monitored.
For over a thousand years of Christianity, nations in Europe have been connected despite differences in language and culture.
The power that is comprehensive encompasses all people, starting from the king down to the commoners.
A primary Christian principle is that possessions should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church finances exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church has been centered in Rome for over a thousand years. This concentration of power and wealth has caused many questions about this teaching.
Immediately after the brief war, England announced a naval blockade of Germany.
Its strategy proved effective, saving critical military and civilian supplies, even though that blockade violated international law generally accepted and codified by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain deployed mines in its waters to prevent other ships from entering its territory, which could cause destruction even for neutral ships.
Because of the response prompted by this tactic, Germany hoped for a similar response for unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the attitude still practiced by many citizens was one of pacifism and self-isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
She only brought 4 cents, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (her former employer) for Thomas Edison when she arrived in the US.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing periods of time, each stage of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
Each dynasty also experienced unstable times, divided by several provinces. The most famous period of this time was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During this period, a fierce war occurred between several nobles to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying to sit on the highest throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single leader.
Once after the Colonial Revolution opened up for all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same thing also applies to the military, because instead of rank being determined by current class, it is now measured based on capability.
The French Revolution also inspired many makers from other countries to begin their own changes.
Muhammad was very fond of all unusual things in worldly life. He often retreated to a cave now called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
That cave stands alone, surviving from age to age, offering insights into the spiritual direction of Muhammad.
Located on one of the peaks of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is very isolated from the outside world.
Honestly, that's not easy to find at all, even if there's one person who knows about it. Once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear and beautiful sky above and many mountains surrounding it. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the 7 wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures ever built to honor the deceased Pharaohs.
The flat land of Giza, or what is known as the "Giza Necropolis" within the Egyptian Plateau, is filled with pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small tombstones, temples, and the Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for "arrow" is like the letter V, and "downward arrow" is like a stack or a square that has lost its bottom side.
The upper meaning is you should start at the tip and push the bow, and the lower meaning is you should start from the bottom (where your hand holds the bow) then pull the bow.
Rubbing upwards usually produces a slow, gentle sound, while rubbing downwards produces a sharp, tense sound.
Feel free to sketch your own characteristics, but remember, the curved lines that have already been printed are due to the music, so they should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
On the train, he planned to make the return journey to Paris surrounded by a group of chattering people and issuing threats to the King and Queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the window of their carriage.
Once upon a time, one of the conspirators presented the head of the murdered royal guard to the frightened queen at Versailles.
The cost of the US imperialist war after conquering the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to finance the bulk of expenditures and interest on bonds floated above the name of the Philippine government through banks on Wall Street.
Surely, the enormous profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will become a fundamental advantage for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must first understand the context that supported the creation of that order.
The period encompassing these events is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a historical period in Europe during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses several ideas in practice, ranging from technological impetus or technology-first to a strong feeling that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic related to scientific laws and manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have 2 common ideas: that technological development follows its own path largely unaffected by cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has “effects” on society as a whole, rather than being socially constructed.
Unfortunately, it seems like there's a slight error in the Sundanese sentence. "Contona" doesn't quite fit and likely should be "Conto na" (meaning "for example"). Assuming that correction, here's the translation: For example, if someone says the car is needed for road development.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new methods in production are being developed to reduce car ownership costs.
The increasing ownership of vehicles also causes more severe injuries in road accidents, leading to the discovery of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged car bodies.
Romanticism has a broad cultural deterministic element, as depicted by authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual. Along with the customs and culture arising from this geography, everything mentioned previously is more aligned with the character of a place and its people, than with universally applied laws.
Paris is known as the fashion capital for modern contemporary styles, while Constantinople is considered the fashion capital for feudal Europe.
This is what is famous as the first luxurious center, starting around 400 AD and lasting until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century, primarily due to the fact that the Crusades had returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were valued more highly than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
The exact time was when the relocation of the title Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was done.
The peak of Gothic style was during the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because the communication channels are slow, trends from the West can be 25 to 30 years out of date.
Facing the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments was people starting to use buttons to be quickly fastened.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried out to produce food that is only sufficient to meet the basic needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often organic, that utilizes locally saved seeds from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most weavers made weaving their livelihood, and this is still common in many developing countries.
Subculture empowers people who think differently, who enjoy things that are unconventional, and who feel marginalized by societal standards, fostering a sense of self-worth.
Subcultures are distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The defining quality of a subculture as distinct may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sex, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of the mineung subculture demonstrate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic style, encompassing clothing, behavior, and argot.
The most common method used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by using several cases of impoverished children, through neglect, weakness, or intentional violence, failing to be socialized by adults when they grow up.
A child like that is called "wild" or *lingas*. Many *lingas* children are often teased by others (usually their own parents); in some cases, such children are abandoned because their parents cannot accept the child’s condition – lacking in intelligence or having an imperfect physical form.
Children experiencing abuse and trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is suspected that it was raised by animals; some say it lived alone in the wild.
When raised by animals rather than humans, feral children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like the animal that raised them, such as fearfulness or indifference towards humans.
If learning is based on projects, it should make learning easier and more interesting, and build a more advanced framework.
Scaffolding isn't a teaching method, but rather assistance that provides support for individuals who are experiencing something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Frames can be virtual or real; teachers are a form of frame, but so is a small paperclip found in Microsoft Office.
The Maya Framework is integrated into the software and is intended to guide, request, and explain difficult procedures to students if done independently.
Children are placed in orphanages for various reasons, starting from being abandoned, abused, up to experiencing sexual abuse.
Ideally, nothing would grow in an environment that doesn't care, nurture, and educate, but in reality, it does.
We consider the Child Foster System to be a safe zone for these children.
Our care system should provide a safe environment, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
At the orphanage, they should provide everything lacking compared to a real home before [the children are] taken [in/adopted].
The internet combines both mass communication and interpersonal elements.
The distinguishing feature of the internet leads to additional dimensions in terms of usage and methods of gratification.
According to Contona, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) considered “intimacy” and “ongoing relationships” to be factors that create enthusiasm when they examined how people react to websites.
The usefulness of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions and fleeting movements visible for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that you always know if a person is complaining or not by carefully observing the subtle expression on their face.
Oliver Sacks, in his letter which is the Presidential Address, described how people who cannot comprehend a speech due to brain disorders can still judge the sincerity of the speaker.
He actually suggested that such an ability to interpret human behavior could be possessed by animals like pet dogs.
Research in the twentieth century shows that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and emerging.
Mutation introduces new genetic variants, then selection removes those from the designated variant pool.
Segregation and recombination are randomized back and forth between two groups and each generation.
If they leave the grasslands, it will be difficult for monkeys whose digestive systems are almost the same as humans to fulfill their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Besides that, failing to do that has serious consequences: starting from depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant-based source is protein available in leaves and beans, but this is difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are thoroughly cooked.
Conversely, insect protein (grasshoppers, crickets, eggs) is not easily digested, but also supplies a lot of protein containing all essential amino acids.
If you’ve already memorized everything, it should no longer be surprising when it’s revealed that our ancestors obtained protein in a way somewhat similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Sleep disturbance is the intentional interruption of sleep during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep afterwards within a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is easily done using a quiet alarm clock to awaken your awareness without fully waking you up.
If you set an alarm while sleeping, and place that alarm on the opposite side of the room, it will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
A choice based on biorhythms is to drink a lot of fluids (clear water or tea, which causes frequent urination) while sleeping, and forcing someone to wake up for breakfast.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The more you lower the level of stress, the more positivity you experience in life. Everyone has the potential to find peace and absolute happiness.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing preventing this goal is our own tension and negative thoughts.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddhism, but is enriched by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhist teachings are very simple. They encompass Kundalini Yoga, asceticism, and a path of love that embraces everything.
And in Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga movements, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan asceticism is Yoga Deva. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the US. The end of the war, with its systems, processes, and cultures, caused countries to become independent.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became staunch enemies, and the Cold War began.
It is hoped this will last for the next 40 years and will be fought for in reality, by proxy forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had collapsed. Their only hope was to retreat and reorganize their defenses at the Roman bridge.
However, this plan fell apart overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods these days is the most efficient way to move many people and goods across the ocean.
The primary role of naval soldiers is to ensure the state maintains the ability to transport troops and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy’s ability to move their troops and goods.
One important example to remember is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The Americans tried to move people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, often using U-boats, was working to stop this congestion.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might well have conquered England just as it had conquered all of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
All the cultures and tribes of the past began with the ease of finding milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Monkeys are commonly kept in groups and released in hilly areas or other bushy regions, often played with by small children or slightly older ones, similar to how people play with trained monkeys. This way of playing is still practiced today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the cart is only made of aligned wooden planks, it will be able to make the horse go faster and pull a heavier load than on a bumpy road.
Cross-ties were initially introduced simply to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the track would be more efficient if there was iron on top of them.
This has become a common practice, but iron makes more damage to the wooden wheels of the cart.
Yesterday, wooden stilts were reportedly replaced with iron stilts. In 1767, the first fully iron ship was introduced.
The first form of transportation known was walking, with the earliest humans walking upright 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright human).
Initially, Australopithecus wasn't flat-faced as is usually the case.
Bipedalism is evidenced in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the green movement, and we can even become environmental advocates to reduce suffering in the future to a certain extent.
This is like treating the symptoms in everything. But, if we are only seeking temporary solutions, then we must find the root of the problem, and then that problem must be eliminated.
It is very clear that the world has changed a lot due to the advancement of human science and technology, and the problems have become bigger due to the large population and the wasteful lifestyle of humanity.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the draft writing—signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson—was sent several blocks to the print shop of John Dunlap.
That night, 150 to 200 sheets were made, which are now famously known as the "Dunlop Flyers".
The public reading of the document was first done by John Nixon in Independence Hall, America on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th and read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25th Dunlap, which is famous, is still a copy of its oldest surviving document. The original handwritten copy was not saved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives among us today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider birds to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many issues regarding birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
That tribe has scales and feathers, lays eggs, and stands on two legs like the T-Rex tribe.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary digits.
Binary numbers only have 1 of 2 values, namely 0 or 1, and these are called binary digits - or bits, when using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning cannot be seen directly. Symptoms, such as frequent vomiting, make immediate diagnosis impossible.
The best indication of poisoning inside the house is the presence of an open medicine container filled with medicine or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists to describe this type of insect.
This term originates from ancient times related to lice, where jumping ability became a parasite of humans due to its incredibly high adaptability.
Both bird lice and bed bugs are equally dangerous, capable of adapting to live in nests and their host's original habitat.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease affecting adults and the elderly.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research indicates that women are twice as likely to have MS compared to men.
A couple decides to separate if it’s not for the sake of maintaining appearances, or for the sake of their children, to raise a child bigger/better.
This match might be a good opportunity to watch other people's babies.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights to another couple who will raise their child.
The main goal of science is to discover how this world works through scientific methods, which in fact serve as guidance for most scientific research.
This isn't guesswork, it's an experiment, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, make observations, and also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, specifically on the Latin Bible.
What was accepted was Aristotle's view of science, including psychology.
When knowledge of Greece diminished, Westerners felt disconnected from the philosophical and scientific roots of Greece.
Many who conduct research on rhythms in physiology and behavior often greatly depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, not only responding to periodic cues from the environment, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, insects, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustained oscillator that will continue a free-running cycle period even if there are no external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the studies that revealed DNA as the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a phage, or virus, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They attempted two experiments marking DNA in phage with radioactive phosphorus or protein from phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline or somatic cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other locations can cause cells to die or become cancerous.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying the natural scenery, including wild plants and animals.
The activities at that place are farming, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting a terrace garden to learn about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans in Kalimantan.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their workplaces, then pass others who are heading to the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone can connect and support a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Current science shows that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of a stable state that supported human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone is encouraged to prioritize walking and using public transportation. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear news about the same issues regarding water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why does the transportation system receive complaints like that, why does it fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of movers and individual vehicles between 2 points and the interaction of relationships between them.
Unfortunately, learning traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers is unpredictable with 100 percent certainty.
Luckily, the driver tends towards fairly consistent behavior; meanwhile, the traffic flow tends to have reasonable consistency and its roughness can be described mathematically.
To better characterize the flow of insects, relationships have been established based on three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship assists in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects are the first animals to fly. The ability to fly helps them escape enemies and find food more easily, and is more efficient for mating.
Most insects have the ability to fold their antennae back along their bodies.
This is a gift of places to hide from predators.
Currently, insects that cannot fold their wings are grasshoppers and dragonflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the sun.
Many people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; namely, that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and other stars).
Isn't it heartbreaking to see the Earth not moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It has more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon River is the longest river on Earth, with a width of 6 miles.
20 percent of the water that spreads through the rivers around the world and then to the ocean originates from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is approximately 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of tributaries.
Even though the construction of pyramids in high stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never able to surpass their size and technical excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptian kingdom was amazed by the monuments left behind by their ancestors, which are over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its implementation and official communication.
Italian is also a language used daily by many people who work in that country, while Latin is more often used for religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Jalmo already knew about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because those elements can be found in nature and were relatively easy to mine using ancient tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, proposed the theory that everything is created from a combination of 1 or more of 4 elements. Those elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more similar to the 4 states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he states his form can be altered to differ from what I currently see.
Alloys in their basic form are a mixture of two or more types of metals. Don't forget there are many elements in the periodic table of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium fall into the category of metals. Of course, there are still metals like silver and gold.
You can also have an alloy that contains non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is very small. Despite its smallness, a trillion atoms have the same size as the period at the end of this sentence.
For me, a hard pencil is a good companion for everyone.
What's truly sad is that with the emergence of new ways to write, the status and usefulness of the traditional *patlot* (writing tool/stylus) are increasingly declining.
Jalmi is currently typing a message on the computer screen, no need to approach the stove.
No one knows what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The hydrogen bomb works based on the principle that energy is needed to fuse many protons and neutrons into a nucleus.
It's like pushing a heavy basket uphill. Separating the core again and then releasing some of that energy.
Several atoms possess unstable nuclei, meaning they have a tendency to split with little or no prompting.
The face of the moon is formed by rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
Its length is approximately 70 km on the western side and 100 km on the eastern side.
That is thinner on the dark side and thicker on the bright side.
If there is more maria (lava) on the near side of the road because it is thinner. It is easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding out what makes people choose or find something appealing to them.
These theories show that people have needs and/or desires that are developed from adolescence to adulthood.
These theories look at what specific people want to do and what around them makes them do and not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when a leader first leads their colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager experiences difficulties in making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and demanding accountability from others.
At the other end of the spectrum, one person would undermine [the work of] the team, feeling they needed to change everything the team did and do it all themselves.
However, the leader is ultimately the one who must be most responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often undermines the relationship between leaders and other team members.
The virtual team is designed to meet the same quality standards as a conventional team, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for the on-site physical team.
They have an autonomous right greater than other conventional team members because they can operate in different time zones that cannot be understood by local management.
The existence of "phantom teams" that are real (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) also constitutes a unique component of virtual teams.
The “invisible team” is a management team whose members report to no one. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to establish a learning organization? One of the goals of practicing the concept of a learning organization is innovation.
Once all materials have been used across all departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, an organization’s process of solving problems together can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and share knowledge and learning about the organization.
Angel (2006) explained the Continuum approach as a tool used by organizations to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition, thereby narrowing the research area and making research more focused.
The pathological relationship of the poles helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage – trauma, injury, and tumors – affect behavior and cause changes in various mental states.
The emergence of new technology allows me to see and understand brain structures and processes that I have never seen before.
This technology provides a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes inside the mind.
Even though AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms an important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning methods, and adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate jobs that require human intelligence.
It includes control, planning and scheduling, the ability to initiate diagnosis and frequently asked questions, and recognizing handwriting, speech, and faces.
Something like that has become a separate field of knowledge, specifically dedicated to providing solutions for real-world problems.
That AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, because it has been built into several home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are a big part for any class. Teachers often like to take their students to places that using a bus is not a wrong choice.
That technology offers solutions for virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a great way to preserve journeys and share experiences with future classes.
Every year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the Nation's Capital, and every year this site is renovated, but old versions are always available on the site to be used as reference material.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of a public audience changes that.
The path of a student is to be a critical participant, one who starts a blog and struggles to develop their writing skills in order to overcome criticism.
Blogging also "helps students become more understanding of the world around them." It’s important to inform audience interests to inspire students to be clever and more engaging (Toto, 2004).
Creating a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond the regular school curriculum.
The benefit of a good blog is that "it can encourage students to be more analytical and critical; because they are actively receiving material from the internet, students become able to understand or determine their position in terms of other people, without forgetting to write down their opinions on various issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the captivating capital city of Canada, bilingual and possessing all kinds of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and to the north is a place for the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Essentially, all of this and many other things considered in the Ontario case are what foreigners perceive as being like a Canadian.
Areas far to the north usually have few inhabitants, and the rest are often just forests.
To compare large populations: There are more African Americans who are blind in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, to this day, the largest, and represents a world apart in the life of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent states, or have ties with France, and are known as a luxury coastline.
Arab people were also the ones who brought Islam to that island, and greatly influenced the Comoros and Mayotte regions.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, this region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every female tourist state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring also helps a lot (but not just one ring that looks very expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can result in what they perceive as harassment and discomfort when followed, touched inappropriately, etc.
Stand up for yourself to reject men, and don't be afraid if you are firm (cultural differences or otherwise, doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber tribes in the 10th century BC, and later used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after the siege in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trade there.
Casablanca is one of the most attractive places around Morocco for shopping.
Around the old city of Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, handicrafts, leather goods, hookahs, and a spectrum of trinkets, but all of that is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the eastern end, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's roads, especially the city center.
When Goma was relatively safe, every visit other than to Goma required knowing what war was ongoing in North Kivu province.
This city also represents the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with several cheaper climbs of the Gorilla Mountains in Africa.
You can use a motorcycle taxi (ojek) to get around Goma. The normal price (local) is around 500 Congolese Francs for short distances.
Enhanced with the difficulty of access, "Timbutku" is made as a metaphor for a distant exotic region.
Currently, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it already has an airport.
In 1990, it was included on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
This is a key moment during the PBS African World Wonders special featuring Henry Louis Gates.
This city is very different from other cities in that country, because it is more influenced by Arab culture than African culture.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in eastern South Africa and stretches along the eastern border with Mozambique, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
This forest spans 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 natural zones, each zone supporting different wildlife.
This park is one of South Africa’s premier tourist attractions and is considered a flagship within South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African National Parks, each has conservation fees and park entry costs.
The Wild Card membership can benefit one person. This card can be used at select game reserves in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is given the name Hong Kong, which is a place considered by tourists as a major hub.
The rows of buildings rising on the Hong Kong skyline are likened to a glittering bar chart emerging with the water in Victoria Harbour.
To witness the most beautiful scenery in Hong Kong, leave the Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across from it.
The majority of urban development in Hong Kong is concentrated in land reclamation along the northern coastline.
This is a place that was claimed by the British colonizers as their colony, so if you want to see evidence of colonial territory from the past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site; the forest area within India is called Sundarban National Park.
This forest isn’t just formed by mangrove forests alone—there are also remnants of a mighty forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km² of which one-third is water/swamp.
In 1966, Sundarban had already become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus terminal daily (crossing the river), though most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Because the intercity buses are often full of people, it is recommended to buy the tickets several days in advance.
Apparently, in several areas, there are small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Ride-sharing taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge, standing over the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Those two towers are 83 meters tall, 378 meters long, and have two tracks with a width of 3.50 m.
The safe distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to the public in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in 2017, when Brazil's customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group inhabiting Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice agriculture.
The Chaco region is the homeland for indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of Spanish colonization and interaction with the native population.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
When Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay successfully preserved many of its original characteristics and identity.
Argentina is famous for having 1 polo team that is the best with players in the world.
Fort Hood announced that the soldiers have finished building a hospital to fight Ebola in Africa and will return to America on emergency leave early this month.
Smaller competitions can also be seen here at another time during the same year.
For information regarding the tournament and where to purchase tickets for the polo match, you can check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is valued at par with one British pound (GBP).
Artos can be exchanged at the only bank on the island located in Stanley across from the FIC West shop.
English is generally accepted on most islands, and Stanley cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the islands, credit cards are not accepted, although British and US currencies are accepted; ask the owner to determine what payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency off the island, so you have to exchange it first before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it experiences summer during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; during the summer, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Wind chill can be more piercing: temperatures rarely drop to freezing, but the wind and dampness combine to feel far worse than what the thermometer indicates.
There’s no such thing as a season called “rainy season” or “dry season”; there’s only rain continuing throughout the year.
Even though the animals in the garden are used to seeing people, wild animals remain wild, so don't feed or disturb them.
According to park officials, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how gentle they appear, bison, deer, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they don't keep the recommended distance. These animals are wild, ferocious, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Besides that, be warned that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so don’t bring smelly food and keep the tent clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and its population is under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has officially been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
That port was a famous naval dead end where, in 1889, 7 ships from Germany, the US, and England refused to leave.
All ships have sunk, except for 1 ship. Approximately 200 lives of Americans and Germans were lost.
The peace negotiations for independence organized by the Mau movement, held in a city, resulted in the murder of its supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland has 2 harbors. The most famous ones are in 3 areas.
North Shore Beach (in the Harbok Kidul district) which is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the south to Devonport in the north.
Almost all the beaches have safe sand for swimming and are shady thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, alongside the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is a family beach that is sometimes crowded with neat shops lining the water’s edge. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number 1', the beer isn’t complex, but it’s tasty and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be brought, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better if you want to bring some.
Tap water that can be drunk directly is indeed safe to drink, but bottled water is easily found if you’re worried.
For Australian people, 'bodas lekoh' coffee is foreign. The small black one is 'espresso', cappuccino with cream (not foam), and it’s often served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard. The fruit juice is thin but delicious.
Returning to the rice fields is commonly done throughout the year, and injuries caused by the fields rarely happen.
Please, always follow the advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appeared near the beaches and river mouths from October to April in North 1770. These jellyfish are sometimes also found outside of those times.
Sharks aren't present here, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't stay silent in the sea; their main habitat is the mouth of rivers north of Rockhampton.
It’s better to ask first if it’s possible to feel comfortable while traveling, knowing you’ll have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually make arrangements with specific hotels, although you can still book other accommodations, such as campsites, by bypassing the travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the order for you if you need time to think about the offer or purchase documents for your purposes (for example, a Visa).
All types of bookings must go through a travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For several festivals, most of those attending the music festival decide to camp in that area, and many attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be closer to the event, you should arrive earlier to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has finished, there might still be some parts that keep the music playing late into the night.
Several festivals provide a camping area specifically for families with twin children.
If you're traveling through Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, because passing over ice often creates a lot of noise that will disturb you.
The Saint Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (subject to conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the value of time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exit doors are often difficult to find.
They usually have facilities, drinks, and offer entertainment for guests to stay comfortable and remain on site.
Many places offer alcoholic beverages at home. However, being drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who plans to drive at high altitudes or across mountains should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, a small amount of lateral friction means you won't be able to drive the same way as on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, the snow is so heavy it can trap you and make you just fall.
Your vision may be obscured by falling or wind-blown snow, or it may also be due to condensation or ice on the car window.
On the other hand, rain, ice, and snow are common occurrences in many countries, and road traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
That safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and is a main destination for tourists.
The term "safari" is generally used to refer to traveling to see the beautiful wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Various animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars and equipment that usually provide a beautiful sight.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes far away, and you'll be able to see them more clearly if you use binoculars.
Hiking (also known as "walking in the forest", "mountain climbing", or simply "walking") is ascending for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be one of the cities in Asia that has hosted two Summer Olympics, having previously hosted the Olympics in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the lockdown was announced, you may experience some difficulties.
Cancellation policies varied, but by the end of March, many cancellation policies based on the coronavirus were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics had already been scheduled.
The prices for most event tickets are expected to range approximately between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and special tickets are expected to cost around ¥7,000.
Hanging up wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, if they aren't provided in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you're okay with wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (it can cause it to shrink, or worse, lose its color).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, heating the water for a minute is enough, but in others it takes longer.
Filters vary in their fineness, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying sealed bottled water from a trusted company.
Tourists may encounter unfamiliar wildlife in their home region.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or even worse can cause allergies, spread poison, or transmit disease.
Diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with their strength are not included in the category of pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods released from taxes and customs duties at specific locations.
Tourists who travel to countries with high taxes usually can save a lot of money, especially on items like alcohol and cigarettes.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through remote, rural areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, stay focused: steep hills, narrow lanes, and roads with many sharp turns await.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those on the preceding and following road sections—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and complying with the regulations is more important than elsewhere.
Here, the cellular phone signal is stronger than along any other route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cookies are very delicious, and in Bavaria, they vary and have many flavors, similar to its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cake is common, and apples are made into cakes throughout the year, then cherries and plums appear during the summer season.
Many German cookies often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. These famous cakes are usually served with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small pastry but rich in flavor, try a pastry whose name varies depending on the region, sometimes called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from spices, served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be served 'dry' or 'wet' depending on the amount of sauce.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry; in South India and some other coastal areas of the continent, coconut milk is typically used instead.
With 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses all kinds of regional dishes found throughout the nation.

Stirrups are foot supports for riders that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
That makes it more stable for the rider, but it can cause safety issues because the rider's feet might get caught in it.
If riding a horse falls off its rider but is cornered in a mine, they could be dragged if the horse bolts. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be implemented.
First, many drivers use rubber boots with heels and soft soles, just enough.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety strap that allows the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.

In good conditions, you can cover distances further than walking – but rarely will you match the speed of a foreign skier without carrying a heavy backpack on a flat track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to several countries means having to go through several visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen Area, in this regard, functions as if it were one country.

Finland is a good sailing destination. "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of lakes and islands in the lakes and along the coasts.
In the archipelago and lakes, you won't need a yacht.

Rowing a boat is a national pastime in Finland, and a boat is for seven or eight people.
This is found in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but elsewhere is very rare (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is 1 to forty).
