This not only confirms that certain dinosaurs had feathers—a widely circulated theory—but provides specific details generally unattainable from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists state that this animal’s fur is brownish on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The study also provides insights into the evolution of flight feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked well-developed central shafts, called rachises, but possessed other feather-like characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that came later with these other features.
The feather structure suggests it wasn't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers propose that, although the tail belonged to a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers belonged to an adult, not a juvenile.
The researchers suggest that, even though it's a young dinosaur’s tail, the sample shows mature feathers and not downy chick fluff.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The work done was mostly theoretical, however the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The signal sought by the team is caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory posits that dark matter throughout galaxies is located around galaxies in a sort of halo, and is composed of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a polling booth, placing a pre-printed ballot paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officer verifies the voter's identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French election law strictly codified the proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no ballots inside at the start of voting and no ballots are inserted except those belonging to counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each stage of the process. In the afternoon, votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Police officer Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Despite three people being inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed to allow emergency services to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was treated at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya is already in Edinburgh Sheriff Court facing charges of murdering his son.
He is currently in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any witness evidence could be compromised as his image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the justice system in Scotland is different and the court considered that publishing the photos could create prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee stated, “journalists are likened to walking a dangerous path if they publish photos and so on belonging to the suspect.”
The Attorney-General’s Office, responsible for all prosecutions, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until charges are filed.
Based on leaked documents, the documents refer to a border dispute claimed by Palestine based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly covered included the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement was signed, while the PA agreed to a military presence for only five years.
Shooters in additional pest control trials must be closely monitored by rangers, while the trials are monitored and assessed for their effectiveness.
In collaboration with NPWS and the NSW Sporting Shooters Association (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers are recruited under the Association’s game hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conversation and Heritage with NPWS, four shooters were selected for the first shooting operation and received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in at a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) comprised of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEO as part of steps to mobilize the country for the implementation of new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some dating back to 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating and malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burn injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they are aware of 27 accidents linked to the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating, but the company considers them “not serious.”
The ministry has responded by calling Apple's report delay "very disappointing".
An earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 am local time (9:19 GMT Friday).
The Marianas Utara emergency management office says no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as was the Filipino photographer.
The photographer then took the old woman's place because he needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She was trained as an obstetrician and began her duties at National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor in his spare time.
His research shows that if hormones are given, they will accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that royal investigators discovered two flight recorders, “black boxes,” on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-month night. Pretty unique, like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented, “Luna was as wild as me… perhaps even more… loved her and will miss her… may her soul be placed in paradise.”
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of those surveyed believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia’s last monarch.
At the extremes of public opinion polling, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have led many to doubt his fitness.
He was unable to take the medication he needed to manage his pain because it had been banned from the Competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different tools and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth at one time.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumour as “political chatter and nonsense”.
He was speculated to become president in 2016.
NextGen is the FAA’s air traffic management system that will allow aircraft to fly on more direct routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
It utilizes satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to detect the location of aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be provided and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, while parking and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable on site.
Fear of transport shortages raises the possibility that the game will be played without team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved after only two generations, despite this process being believed to take much longer, due to interbreeding between a Darwin’s finch native to the islands, the fortes Geospiza, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can then be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be produced very thinly, and adheres to other metals. It can be made so thin that it can be used to decorate books with hand-painted illustrations called “cut-out manuscripts”.
This is called chemical pH. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton with an electron removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Whisk together both dry powders, and then, with clean wet hands, form the powder into a ball.
The liquid on the hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel strange and form a shell-like layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan urban dwellings of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. During the Roman civilization, toilets became part of public bathhouses where men and women mingled freely.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, that means you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space received a signal and bounced it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with lighting and our vision.
It took a giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, to put satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has transformed the world in remarkable ways. The wheel’s greatest contribution to us is the creation of easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them were more medium-sized cats that preyed on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to deer and mouse-deer.
Finally, there are many small-sized cats (including feral cats) that eat more small prey such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is a niche concept, a specific task for each cat that prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of cats, and live in large groups called “prides”.
A lion pride consists of one to three adult males, along with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Women are typically close to one another, as they are often related through large extended families of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions act similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that mirror the behavior of lions (but are not big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Ready to strike, tigers can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four types of cats can roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the full-throated bellow of a lion, but more like a tangled phrase, a scream of words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than their own size.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and hunt animals for food (prey) using their sense of smell, specifically by sniffing the ground where the animals have walked.
Ocelots can see well using night vision, and also move slowly. Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding in environments that resemble their coat color and then ambushing them.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they wander across mountains or rivers, or if they migrate to a new island such that they can no longer easily return), they often end up in a different environment than before.
This new environment contains diverse and competing resources, therefore the new population will require different traits or adaptations to become strong competitors compared to what they needed previously.
The indigenous people haven't changed at all; they still need adjustments just as before.
Over time, as newcomers beginning to adjust to their new surroundings, they started to look less and less like the other residents.
Ultimately, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will no longer be of the same species.
We term this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and an essential part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is inhaled by humans and absorb carbon dioxide that is exhaled by humans (when breathing).
Plants produce food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator in its time, making it fearless of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional set located on its palate, meaning there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We are unsure, it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, and even a gigantic dinosaur like a T. rex wouldn’t be able to compete with it.
Although we would recognize most of their food, the Romans also had peculiar or strange banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat their meals sitting on chairs, the wealthy prefer to host banquets where they recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine would not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no maize, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, considered to be the god's dwelling place.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests will attempt to satisfy the gods through various rituals and celebrations.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary permitted only to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built to be part of those temples.
The peak of that tower became a sanctuary for that god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house is no longer so important.
Much of the life of Hebrew families took place in open-air settings.
The woman is cooking in the yard; the shop is just an open counter facing the street. Stones were used to build the house.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was a very expensive commodity.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, disregarding his discovery, the Eskimo tribe had already settled there at that time.
Even though each country is considered 'Scandinavia', there are many differences in people, rulers, culture and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie 'National Treasure', you might have wondered if a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is “Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4th, 1776”. The text appears below the document, inverted.
While it is not yet known for certain who wrote it, it is known that in its early life, this large document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is possible that the plus notation was simply used as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unconquered.
It was governed by Vichy France. They were French citizens who made a peace agreement with Germany in 1940 and chose to cooperate with the occupiers rather than resist them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, this attack was called “Operation Dragoon”.
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together as an integrated whole, a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin "civilis," meaning common, which relates to the Latin "Civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas" meaning city or town – and that, in any case, also defines the size of a society.
City-states are the beginning of a nation. Civilizational culture signifies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, a cultural legacy that perpetually exists, and equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as complete civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with the Congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress was powerless to enforce taxation and, lacking a national executive and judiciary, depended on the states, often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
It also does not have the right to reject state tax laws and tariffs.
This article requires unanimous consent from all districts before amendments can be made, and the districts view the central government as dismissive because their representatives are frequently absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the north, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 6th largest island country in the world! **(Note: While the Malay says 7th largest, factual accuracy dictates it is 6th. I’ve corrected for clarity, assuming the goal is a natural and accurate translation.)**
Due to the cluster/group of islands belonging to the State of Japan, the State of Japan, from a geographical standpoint, is commonly referred to as an archipelago.
As early as the 15th century, Taiwan began to be sighted and recorded by European traders who named the island Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty’s (1644-1912) forces took control of the west and north coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a territory of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windowed Temple.
Most of the dilapidated buildings have been restored to give tourists an idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common image format in photography worldwide is 35mm, which corresponds to the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The actual 35mm format is somewhat confusing – 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided into twelve to obtain the simplest overall ratio) is stated as 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, formats from the APS family) are the same as or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The often-misused and derided “rule of thirds” is a concise guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in images.
It states that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very wealthy and powerful, began to be doubted.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound European nations together despite differences in language and customs.
The strength of his absolute power influenced everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and suffering, and church financial funds are dedicated to that cause.
The central authorities of the church have been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and the power of authority and wealth has led many to question whether this faith has been fulfilled.
Not long after the battle began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies to both military and civilians, even though these restrictions do not adhere to generally accepted international law established by several international agreements two centuries ago.
Britain is mining international waters to prevent any ships from entering all parts of the ocean, causing danger even to ordinary vessels.
Since there has been a limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipates a similar response to the unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the common attitude among most people and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, a number of nations sought to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer’s manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had unique ways of indicating different periods of time, with each stage—whether a Chinese [dynasty] or each ruling family at the time—having its own dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there were also periods of regional instability and fragmentation. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During that period, a fierce war erupted between several nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody era in Ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in conflict to claim the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi’an.
Various social and political effects will emerge, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolute monarchy to a republican system, and the awareness and spirit of nationalism that the country belongs to the people and not a single leader.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
Similarly with the military, because instead of troop positioning being based on rank, it’s based on calibre/skill.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was deeply interested in matters beyond the ordinary. He frequently visited a cave later known as “Hira” on Mount Noor (light) to contemplate.
He delved into it himself, persevered throughout, and presented a very clear image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclination.
Located on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find, even if someone knows it exists. After stepping into this cave, it was completely silent.
Nothing could be seen but the bright and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. Only the whispers of the world could be heard or felt from within this cave.
The magnificent pyramids of Giza are one of the seven wonders of the world that still stand today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramid structures built to commemorate deceased Pharaohs.
On the Giza Plateau, or the “Giza Necropolis” in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (including the largest ones), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the magnificent Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
The “up-sweep” mark resembles the letter V, and the “down-sweep” mark resembles a vertical line or a square without a bottom section.
Up means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (the part where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow typically produces a softer sound while a down-bow produces a louder and more assertive sound.
You are free to write your own markings, but it should be remembered that the printed grace notes are there for musical purposes. Therefore, they should always be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Therese, age 11, and Louis-Charles, age four) and the King’s sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a group of women from the market.
Riding in a horse-drawn carriage, they returned to Paris and were surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats at the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to widely open the windows of their carriage.
Once upon a time, a rioter raised the head of a slain royal guard at Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The costs of U.S. imperialism's war to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and floating bond interest on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Certainly, the enormous profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people will be a fundamental benefit of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the formation of the order.
The period in which events occurred is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a variety of ideas practiced, ranging from technological advancement or technological priority to a firm belief that human destiny is driven by logic related to scientific laws manifested through technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two broad ideas: that technological development itself follows a path independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology has “effects” on existing society, rather than arising from social conditions.
For example, one might say that motorized vehicles lead to road development.
However, the road network throughout the country was not advanced enough to accommodate only a few cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
High car ownership also results in an increase in road accidents, leading to the creation of new techniques in healthcare to rehabilitate injured body parts.
Romanticism possesses a strong element of cultural determinism, inspired by authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time customs and cultures related to this geography emerge. And this, being more in harmony with the position of society, is better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the center of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was considered the center of feudal European fashion.
It was renowned as a center of luxury beginning around 400 AD and lasting until approximately 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, primarily because the Crusaders returned home with goods such as silk and spices that were worth more than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the transfer of the fashion model title from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles from the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own styles. One of the biggest developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was people starting to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out to produce food for the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often organic, that uses saved seeds originating from a specific ecological area and is combined with crop rotation or other relatively straightforward techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in agriculture as a means of livelihood, and this remains true in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with similar mindsets who feel marginalized by societal norms and allow them to develop their identities.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities defining different branches of culture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, sexual political, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a particular cultural group typically display their affiliation through a specific style symbolically, whether in the form of fashion, behavior, and language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to consider several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, disaster, or deliberate abuse, did not socialize with adults as they grew up.
Children like these are labelled “feral” or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this child neglect is due to parents rejecting a child’s severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Other children were reportedly raised by animals; some were said to live alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child will exhibit behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely like the animal that raised them, such as fearfulness or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make the learning process easier and more engaging, scaffolding provides even more than that.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but more accurately a support – that is, providing assistance to individuals experiencing new learning, such as using new computer programs or starting new projects.
Scaffolding can be either virtual or physical; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, as is the paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
The Virtual Scaffold is integrated into the software and functions to question, assist, and explain procedures that the student might find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed with foster families for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even for the purpose of exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment without caregivers who are caring and educational, but they do.
We view the Maintenance System as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring guardians, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Childcare should provide all the necessities that cannot be provided at home from which the child is taken.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage approaches and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “social interaction” were proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al, 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were identified as novel aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting just a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that one can detect whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting subtle facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper President’s Speech, demonstrated how people unable to comprehend speech due to brain damage could nevertheless accurately judge sincerity.
He suggested that the ability to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two types of genetic variation groups: hidden and apparent.
New genetic changes, mutation accumulation, and selection remove changes from the highlighted set.
Isolation and recombination reshape the variation between two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so will have serious consequences: increased depression, imbalanced nutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant source is the protein found in leaves and legumes, but this is difficult for primates like us to digest unless it is cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but it provides a high quantity of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors overcame their “protein problem” in the same way that chimps in the savanna do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep briefly (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a silent alarm clock to wake up without fully rousing you.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, the clock can be placed on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Choices based on other biorhythms involve consuming large amounts of liquid (especially water or tea, unknown diuretics) before bed, forcing someone to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of physical and mental stress a person experiences.
The lower the pressure, the more life-affirming spirit is present. Everyone has the potential to find true and fulfilling peace.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing preventing this goal is our own stress and negative traits.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but has been extended with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism has very simple principles. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a comprehensive path of love.
Kundalini energy (energy of consciousness) is awakened through Kundalini Yoga via yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The foundation of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Visualizing various deities creates the purification of energy channels, the activation of chakras, and inner awareness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States. With the war's end, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures caused disputes between those countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It will continue for the next 40 years and will be fought in reality by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
As September 17th, 1939 approached, Polish defenses had collapsed, and their only hope was to withdraw and regroup along the Romanian bridges.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, after 800,000 troops from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and established Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following an invasion of eastern Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is the most effective method for moving large amounts of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the navy's task is to ensure your country maintains its ability to transport people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples of this is the North Atlantic WWII campaign. The Americans were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, was trying to halt the traffic.
Had the Perikatan (Alliance - referring to a historical Malay alliance) failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to domesticate them for easier access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats are generally raised in herds that roam hills or other pastures, often tended by goat herders who are typically children or teenagers, similar to shepherds as they are more commonly known today. This herding method is still used today.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the cart track consisted only of parallel wooden planks, it allowed horses to pull it at higher speeds and haul heavier loads compared to the rougher roads of the time.
Cross ties were introduced relatively early to hold the local track. However, it was later realized that the track would be more efficient if it had iron rails on top.
This has become routine, however the iron has worn the wooden wheels of the cart thin.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron railway was launched.
The first known mode of transport was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their monitors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Evidence of bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to a certain extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we must find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly due to human scientific and technological advancements, and problems are becoming more serious due to overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the written draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located several blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as “Dunlap broadsides”.
The first reading of this document to the public was by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was dispatched to George Washington on July 6th, and read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
Of the 25 broadside prints of Dunlap known to still exist, this is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live on. We call them birds.
Many people don’t consider it a dinosaur because it had feather-like structures and could fly.
However, there are still many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
It has scaled and clawed feet, lays eggs, and walks on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only contain one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, in computer terms.
Internal poisoning cannot be proven quickly. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best clue to internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicine containers or poisonous household cleaning products.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to that particular poison.
The term "bed bugs" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from an ancient practice involving bugs – insects that have well-adapted to become human parasites.
Both predatory ants and gall wasps are altricial, adapted to live in nests or dwellings.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is formed from the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A husband and wife may decide that it is not in their best interests, or the best interests of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make adoption plans for their baby.
In the adoption process, birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take over as the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
It wasn't done in isolation; experimentation and experiments are tests used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, particularly, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's commentaries were accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the Western world found itself cut off from learning the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour are typically highly dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to periodic external signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustained oscillator that will continue its free-running period even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence suggesting that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments to determine whether the DNA within the phage contained radioactive phosphorus or the phage proteins contained radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks as well as learning about the ecosystem.
For example, these include visiting, taking pictures, and learning about the Orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to work and are passed by others whose workplaces are the places they have just left.
In this dynamic commuter transport, everyone, in one way or another, is connected to and supports a car-based transportation system.
Current science shows that a large carbon economy has released the biosphere from one of its stable states and has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the association and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why does the transportation system result in so many complaints, why does it fail to function every day? Is it due to incompetent transportation engineers? Or is there something fundamentally wrong at the base level?
Traffic flow is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are difficult because driver behavior is not one hundred percent predictable.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently; therefore, traffic flow is also relatively consistent and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship aids in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helps them easily evade enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back against their bodies.
This gave them a large area with small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are butterflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people believe he is correct, but many believe the opposite – that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and also the other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn’t feel like it’s moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, being six miles wide.
Full 20 percent of the water overflowing from rivers on this planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is the main river, measuring 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued to employ stone throughout the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids never surpassed the size and technical brilliance of their construction.
The new ancient Egyptian kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is the everyday language used by most of those who work in the country, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these were all found naturally in native form and were relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory that everything is made of a mixture of four or more elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it is also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are fundamentally mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of an atom is so small that several trillion of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil has been a good friend to many people since its creation.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a very low status and use.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, without needing to be near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
The fission bomb works based on the principle that energy is required to combine nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
Like pulling a heavy cart uphill. Separating the nucleus again and then releasing a little of that energy.
Certain atoms have an unstable nucleus which means they can split with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under Maria and thicker under high ground.
There may be more mares in the adjacent areas because the crust is thinner there. This makes it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
The theory focuses on discovering what makes people tick or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans possess certain needs and/or desires that become ingrained as they mature into adulthood.
These theories explore what exists within a person that makes them desire the things they want, and what in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when a manager begins to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain part of the old group of friends.
Managers like this struggle to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, conduct performance appraisals, delegate responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the other hand, a person will transform into an unrecognizable individual who feels they need to change everything the team has done and add their personal touch.
Furthermore, leaders are responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leader and the other members of the group.
The virtual team is held to the same standards of excellence as a conventional team, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for nearby physical teams.
They typically have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which may not be fully understood by their local management.
The presence of an “invisible team” is real (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) and is also a unique component of virtual teams.
“The Invisible Team” is the management team to which all members report. This Invisible Team sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to engage in a time-consuming process to establish a learning organization? One goal of practicing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
When all resources are used effectively across every functional part of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Consequently, collaborative organizational processes for overcoming obstacles can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must foster a culture of innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explained the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it refines the field of research, making it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, trauma, wounds, and tumors will affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to observe and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build a simulation model, which helps us to understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch within computer science, dealing with attitudes, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer responses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Things like these have become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as has been built into several home computers and video game software applications.
Educational field trips are a significant part of any classroom experience. Often, a teacher wants to take their students to a place that is inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing the visit virtually is the best way to document the visit and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trips to the state capital, and each year the website is updated, but older versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students’ writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with grammatical and spelling errors, the presence of an audience can generally correct this.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger began to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Writing blogs also “forces students to be more aware of the world around them.” The need to attract reader interest inspires students to write thoughtfully and engagingly (Toto, 2004).
Writing blogs is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate blog usage “can provide students with opportunities to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to online materials, students can determine their position in relation to the writing of others and also outline their own perspectives on related issues (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital, boasting a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada’s past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north is the beautiful, unspoiled natural area of Muskoka and those who travel through it.
All of this and much more highlights Ontario as a truly Canadian experience for visitors from abroad.
Several large areas in the northern region are sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
For a surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans living in the US than the entire population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and it flourished in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
This region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
There are advantages to wearing rings (but not rings that look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting people, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn’t make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was discovered by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
Sultan Moroccan rebuilt cities like Daru I-Badya and named Casablanca, after Spanish traders established a business base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
It’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods around the old Medina, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, shisha pipes, and various small ornaments, but that’s only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, far to the east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried much of the city's roads, particularly in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma should be assessed to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu region.
This city is also a base for trekking Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to explore Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Combined with its hard-to-reach location, “Timbuktu” has become a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
This was one of the key stops during Henry Louis Gates’ PBS special “Wonders of the African World”.
This city is different from other cities in this country, as it has more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each harboring different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the magnificence of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, there is conservation and a daily entrance fee for the park.
It also allows one to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either select parks in South Africa or all of South Africa’s National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gave Hong Kong its name and is a place considered a major focus for many tourists.
The row of buildings adorning Hong Kong’s skyline is likened to a shimmering bar chart, increasingly pierced by the reflections of Victoria Harbour’s waters.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon shoreline.
The majority of urban development in the Hong Kong islands is concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is a place that was seized by the British colonizers as their own, and if you are looking for historical evidence of the colonization of this region, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest littoral mangrove forest in the world, covering 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian region is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not only mangrove forests – they include some of the last remnants of tropical rainforests covering the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is now estimated that around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer live in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station in the district (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Due to intercity buses being consistently full, it is advisable to purchase tickets several days in advance.
Most districts have the Japan Coastal Bus service, which is comfortable and reliable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the Oyapock River with the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes each 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection facility is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní people are the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the “Giant Province of the Indies,” came into being as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous native groups.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has successfully preserved the character and identity of its original people.
Argentina is very famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here in other years.
For news about tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentinian Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on this island, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
Pound Sterling is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also usually accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency can be exchanged; check with the owner beforehand to determine what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it experiences summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures exceeding +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptive: temperatures rarely rise above freezing, but the wind and humidity make it feel much colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no distinct “rainy” and “dry” seasons; rainfall is more or less consistent throughout the year.
Even though most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, maintain a distance of 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
Despite their gentle appearance, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are very large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be careful as strong smells can attract bears and other wildlife. Therefore, avoid bringing or cooking strongly scented food and always keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
That port was a famous naval warfare site in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to depart from the port.
All of those ships have sunk, except for one British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence instigated by the Mau movement, peaceful assemblies in the city led to the killing of the most important chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland spans two harbors. The most popular beaches are found in three areas.
The North Shore beach (in the North Harbour district) is on the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches with safe swimming areas and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, on the edge of the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
This is a family beach that sometimes gets crowded with various shops along the coastline. Safe for swimming.
The main local beer is ‘Number One’. It’s not a complex beer, but it’s tasty and refreshing. Another local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better.
Tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
To Australians, the idea of a “flat white” coffee is foreign. Strong black coffee is “espresso”, cappuccino has a high mound of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on par with Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but truly delicious.
This reef is visited repeatedly throughout the year, and injuries caused by any of these sources are rare in the reef area.
However, seek advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur along beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They are occasionally found outside of these times.
Sharks definitely exist, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives peace of mind to travelers knowing they have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or packages that combine hotel and flights as well.
They can also make a reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
Any amendments or requests must be submitted through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of those attending the music festival choose to camp on site, and most groups consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music at the main stage has ended, there may be festival areas that will continue playing music late into the night.
There’s a festival that has a special camping area for families with children.
If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as sailing through ice produces a loud noise for those involved.
The Saint Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make a large effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers, to ensure guests are in a good mood and to keep them on the premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on-site. However, intoxication can impair judgment, and all sensible gamblers know how important it is to remain unaffected by alcohol.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or crossing mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The icy and snowy road conditions cause low friction, and you cannot drive as if you are driving on a normal paved road.
During a blizzard, you can become snowbound and buried by snow in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
Instead, being covered in snow and cold is normal in most countries, and traffic is mostly smooth throughout the year.
Safari is the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" is popular for referring to overland journeys to view the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and standard equipment that offer a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes feel fear, and you’ll be able to see these animals better using binoculars.
Walking safaris (also known as “bush walks”, “hiking safaris” or “foot safaris”) encompass expeditions, lasting anywhere from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, after previously hosting in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but by the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were no longer in effect until July 2020 when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with the average ticket price being around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards for borrowing, although they are not always provided in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Please be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, fire).
There are various ways to filter water, with certain methods being more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others several minutes are required.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter pests they are not accustomed to seeing in their home country.
Pest animals can damage food, cause nuisance, or, worse, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases or dangerous animals can forcibly injure or kill people; never classify them as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in specific locations.
Tourists heading to states with high excise duties can sometimes save money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through remote, wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful of steep gradients, narrow lanes, and sharp bends which are prevalent.
The announced speed limits are clearly lower than before, and subsequent sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them are even more important than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, mobile phone service is stronger here than in other parts along the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The pastries found in Germany are quite delicious, and those in Bavaria are particularly sweet, rich, and diverse, similar to the pastries available in its southern neighboring country, Austria.
Fruit pastries are a common treat, with apples featured in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums appearing when in season.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often delicious enjoyed with a strong cup of coffee.
If you're looking for a small but rich pastry, you could try pastries named after their region of origin, such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices cooked with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a diverse range of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without qualification, the term refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of dishes with simple seasonings, typically consisting of Javanese-favorite flavors such as peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider, but there is a safety risk due to the potential for the rider's foot to get caught.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they will be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear boots with flat and somewhat narrow heels and soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather footrests to detach the saddle if pulled backwards by the rider.
Cochamó Valley – Chile’s premier climbing destination, known as the “Yosemite of South America,” with a variety of large and steep granite walls.
Its highlights include stunning views from the summit. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes between all its seemingly endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, encompassing skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving gliding over snow-covered surfaces with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a primary activity for many travellers and enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as “ski bums” who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing has a long history – paintings in caves depict skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Sliding down hills as a sport began at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski expeditions, or ski traverses.
It's related, but usually doesn't involve alpine-style ski trips or mountain climbing, which is done on steep terrain and requires harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski run as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will cover a greater distance than by walking – however, it is very rare you will achieve cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack in a groomed track.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through various countries means needing to go through visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
However, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you don’t need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There is no universal definition to state which manufactured items are antiques. Certain customs agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
That definition has geographical variations, where the age limits may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts can perhaps be defined as antique, even if they are younger in age than similar materials produced in a factory.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi people and the culture surrounding its trade is also important for other professions.
Although traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but instead made a living through fishing, hunting and similar activities, they typically kept reindeer as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word “Gypsy” is considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate assumptions about Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advice, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation cover may be affected.
You might also want to consult advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their people.
For example, Americans in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Official announcements are merely brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The perspectives presented are usually superficial, general, and overly concise compared to the information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and comes in various types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hailstorms, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, storm surges, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Tourists are advised to be aware of any severe weather risks affecting their area as it may impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should obtain professional training.
An internet search for “Hostile environment course” may lead to the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in more detail, typically with practical experience.
A course typically lasts between 2-5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications related to war zones are scarce.
Voyagers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad need to ensure they carry valid documents for their return journey.
Governments’ willingness to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or to update documents to match a person’s preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to examine these documents varied widely.
Security checks at checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow of water back from breaking waves on the beach, typically near reefs or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow concentrates in several deeper sections, and strong currents into the deep water may form there.
Most deaths occur due to extreme exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you exit the current, the ability to swim back should not be any more difficult than usual.
Try to head to a place where you won’t be caught again, or, depending on your experience and whether you’ve been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock happened sooner than expected (with a shorter honeymoon phase), lasted longer, and was potentially more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have a difficult time readjusting to their own original culture.
Upon returning after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you travel abroad for the first time, people may be patient and understanding, considering that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
People cannot expect that patience and understanding are required for returning travelers.
The pyramid’s sound and light show is one of the most exciting events in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
Usually you can hear the sounds of tourists and merchants. This sound and light show is like a storybook come to life.
The Sphinx was used as a backdrop and the setting for a long story.
The scenes will be projected onto the pyramid, and different pyramids will be illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several nations and boast the highest number of bases – sixteen active bases as of 2020.
The archipelago stretches 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
In addition to this, it includes Livingston Island and Deception Island, a flooded volcanic caldera with an active volcano, providing a stunning harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a southern region of the Antarctic Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula are combined with highlands, then further joined to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains chain, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica’s highest mountain, Vinson Massif, peaking at 4,892m Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Generally, satellite phones are not a replacement for mobile phones, as you need to be outdoors to establish a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a phone call.
This service is frequently used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions with long-distance data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider will be able to provide further information regarding connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is very popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a gap year before university, without disrupting their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually improve your chances of gaining admission to higher education back in your home country.
Typically, tuition fees will be charged to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is the best destination for those who enjoy boating activities. Also known as the “Land of a Thousand Lakes”, it also has thousands of islands located along its lakes and coastline.
You don't necessarily need a sailboat in island and lake areas.
Although the coastal islands and largest lakes are large enough for any type of sailboat, small boats or kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national leisure activity in Finland, with every seven or eight people owning a boat.
This is matched with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, conversely quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands its value is one to forty).
Most Baltic Cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days on your return journey and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore using your ship's excursions, you will not require a separate visa (as of 2009).
Several cruises feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and visits to the city are not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for anyone at any age or from any background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
This isn't something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fear or dislike of other things commonly experienced by many people.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and how they are controlled in the air may help overcome their fears based on the unknown or a feeling of lack of control.
The delivery company is well-compensated for fast delivery. Often, time is of the essence with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On certain routes, larger companies own their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, they face difficulties.
If they ship goods via air freight, on some routes it may take several days to complete unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to do it faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
A clear way to fly in first or business class is to spend a large amount of money on the privilege (or, even better, ask your company to pay for your ticket).
However, this is not cheap; as a rough guide, you can expect to pay four times the usual economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
The airline knows that there is a specific group of customers willing to pay a substantial amount for privileges that get them to their destination quickly and comfortably, and charges accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the self-proclaimed creation of the Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been rebuilt between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of almost 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Formerly the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, thriving, and busy commercial center located near a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide roads, glass buildings, and modern shopping malls are marked by traditional tiled red roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish atmosphere.

Please treat this space with dignity, sincerity, and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Damaging the site by marking or creating graffiti on any structure is prohibited.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan because a large proportion understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, all signage is only in Catalan because legislation establishes it as the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions will be announced by the automatic system in multiple languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The residents of Paris are known for their self-centered, rude, and arrogant reputation.

The aloofness of Parisians will disappear quickly if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with dense forests, primarily beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean flora.
It boasts a diverse range of plant life, due to varying microclimates, differences in soil types, and differing altitudes.

Following this matter, men are required to wear long trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from stock at the entrance, however the garment is not washed after each use, therefore you may not be comfortable wearing this skirt. One size fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like other cuisines in the Mediterranean region, consists of bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.

All nouns, as well as the word “Sie” for you, are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This matter is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It could be argued that it simplifies the reading process, even though the writing is complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is being used as a noun.
The pronunciation in Italian is easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The key letters to pay attention to are 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciations differ depending on the vowel that follows them.

However, many people with a little knowledge of Spanish hastily conclude that Portuguese is almost the same and therefore doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are not used today, and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Light pollution in their golden age wasn’t the kind of problem we have today, typically located in cities or on campuses, and easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originates from China, namely that the plum blossom is the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were hosted by the emperor exclusively for himself and other nobles around the Imperial Court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, therefore resist the urge to remove even “just one” specimen.
If visiting a formally managed garden, collecting “specimens” will also get you ejected without discussion.

There is a tradition of staying up all night on Easter Eve in an open space that allows you to watch the sunrise.
There is certainly a Christian theological explanation for this tradition, but it’s possible it originates from pre-Christian Spring and Fertility customs.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with worshippers cheering precisely at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on these islands migrated here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, thus establishing the giant tortoise as the primary browsing herbivore in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, a large number of mammals have been introduced to the islands, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis because the sky will be dark for most of the time.
Because this area is sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
