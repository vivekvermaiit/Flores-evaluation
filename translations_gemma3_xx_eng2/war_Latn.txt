This doesn't confirm that at the very least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is gaining traction, but it provides details that are rarely given by fossils, such as color and three-dimensional texture.
Scientists have discovered that this animal’s upper fur is chestnut-brown, with a pale or carotenoid color underneath.
The discovery still offers insight into the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possessed other feather-like characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers say the rachis was a later evolutionary development compared to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that, even if it resembles a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and isn’t the skin of a hatchling.
Researchers suggest that, even if it looks like a baby dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the skin of a chick.

They understood that the Sun operates on the same fundamental principles as other stars: The activity of all stars in the system was understood to be driven by their mass, their spin, and nothing else.
The combination of radiation and convection are used together to understand the Rossby number of a star, which relates to the flow of plasma.
The higher the Rossby number, the less active a star is with respect to magnetic variations.

The work was theoretical, but a program was written to test the observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team may be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravitational pull causes tides on Earth, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists say that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory suggests that the abundance of dark matter around a galaxy can be found in a galaxy in a kind of halo, and it is made up of a large number of very small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In a press conference, he said that the new variant is "very scary and alarming due to its very high mortality rate."
Perhaps some other patients in the ward at the hospital were infected, Dr. Moll thought, and at least two health workers from the hospital as well.

Infrared images show that temperature differences from night to day suggest they might very well be caves.
They are colder than the surrounding puddles during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior isn’t like the large caves on Earth that continuously and overwhelmingly maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it does agree with deeper boreholes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: a voter goes alone into a booth, places a pre-printed ballot paper summarizing their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter will drop the ballot into the ballot box and sign the voter's roll.
The French law on elections strictly codified the processes.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there were no ballots before the start of voting and no ballots were added except for those of counted and authorized voters.
The candidates may send their watchers to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Despite the events of Wednesday, Carpanedo competed against two individuals in the Championships.
His first race was the Slalom, where he had a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place Gyongyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their run, and 45 out of 117 of the total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to rank in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped a woman from Switzerland and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused were named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, ordered that the accused appear in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.
Meanwhile, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road was temporarily closed where the accident happened while emergency services helped the driver get out of the red Audi TT.
She was the first to be taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, she was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya previously appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court facing charges of murdering his son.
She is currently in custody awaiting trial and facing charges, but any evidence found might be compromised because her image is already tarnished in the public eye.
This practice is common in other parts of the UK, but the legal justice system differs in Scotland, and the court found publishing the photos potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said that "journalists are walking a dangerous line when publishing photos and other materials of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is handling the cases, informed the media that no further comment will be issued, even regarding the visit.
The document, according to sources, details the disputes over the territories that Palestine desires, based on the boundaries before the 1967 Mideast War.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the issue in the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding the continued military presence in the hills for a period of ten years when an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to accept such a presence for only five years.
The firearms used in the latest trial for pest control should be inspected by security personnel, as the trials are monitored and their effectiveness is observed.
Through the partnership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected in the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a nine-member interim Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth CEP of Martelly’s within four years.
During the past month, a commission recommended the former CEP launch into office as part of a transition plan to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was the solution implemented by Martelly to the escalating protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests erupted due to the failure to conduct elections, some dating back to 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods due to excessive charging have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires that gave four people minor burns.
According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan, it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry received information through a call about an immediate report from Apple that was "very concerning."
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management says no national disasters have been reported to them.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said again that there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six were confirmed dead in the incident.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were among the first to be released, as were the Filipino photographers.
Without hesitation, the photographers moved their positions from the elderly woman because she needed to use a washbasin. Mendoza was shot and died.
Liggins followed the footsteps of his father and entered the field of medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor during her free time.
Her research shows that if the hormone is managed, it may help delay lung maturation in infants.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' recorders from the flight on Wednesday.
The veteran wrestlers still paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna is the greatest Queen of the Extreme. My greatest manager. Luna passed away on the night of the full moon. There's no one like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is like me, she loves to make people laugh...maybe even more so...I loved her and I will miss her...I hope she is in a better place now."
Aside from the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposing Australia becoming a republic decreased by 8 percent from 2008.
It was revealed by a biographer that Prime Minister Julia Gillard believed during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those in the poll share the view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarchy in Australia.
At the conclusion of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
An Olympic gold medalist needs to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to their complaints, their health is being questioned.
She cannot take the necessary medicines to help cure her illness because they are prohibited by the Mulay.
Hi Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are possibly responsible for delivering water to Earth along with organic molecules that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to learn how planets were formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets have been colliding with Earth since ancient times.
Hi Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the stories as "political and adventurous tales."
It was rumored that he would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system proclaimed by the FAA that allows aircraft to fly more direct routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while reducing carbon emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology, unlike the older ground-radar-based technology, allowing for air traffic control to monitor aircraft with great precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional vehicles will be allowed in, and the overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley, and the car parks and park-and-ride facilities will no longer be available underneath.
Those fearful of transportation shortages have increased the possibility that candidates will be forced to campaign behind closed doors without any group support.
A study published on Tuesday in the journal Science reported the discovery of a new species of finch on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species can evolve within just two generations, even though this process was previously thought to take much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin’s finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into various shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
This can be softened and shaped with thin wire, which can be twisted and stretched. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
This can be made very thin, and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called pH in chemistry. You can make an indicator using the red juice of cabbage.
The color of cabbage changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of Hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two cups of dry powder, and then, using clean, hollowed hands, knead it to form a ball.
The resin on your hands will react with the outer layers, becoming sticky to the touch and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
The ceramic pipes of the drainage system were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There are still toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women gathered in mixed company.
If you call someone a thousand miles away, you used a satellite.
The satellite in the sky is the one receiving the call and then it immediately returns it down below.
The satellite is launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere blocks some of our light and observations.
You would need a giant rocket taller than 100 feet to put a satellite or telescope into space.
Technology has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing technology has done for us is give us easier and faster transportation.
The train, cars, and many other modes of transportation were invented by people like us.
Underneath this is the right size for predators that eat the right size of prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, many small mammals (including non-domesticated small mammals) ate larger prey such as insects, frogs, snails, and crabs.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche specialization, a special task for each individual to avoid competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all wild animals, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one horse and three young men of suitable age, along with a horse and thirty women and children.
Women often form close bonds with each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lions’ prides are organized like packs of wolves or flocks of chickens, with animals that resemble lions (but not the large males) as the majority, and they still manage to kill their victims.
A magnificent athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not well), swim, leap great distances, and lift five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is included in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four species that can roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t the same as the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a voicing of fierce, whispered words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They prey on monkeys, deer, ducks, and turkeys if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots prey on are smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and hunt prey animals by scent, smelling where those animals have been.
They see beauty even in darkness with a vision in the night, and they secretly observe. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they came (such as when they move to the mountains or a river, or when they move to a new island where they cannot easily return), they usually see themselves in a different environment than where they originally lived.
This new environment has diverse resources and diverse competitors, therefore the new population will require diverse qualities or adaptations to become a strong competitor against what was previously needed.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they started to be seen mingling and interacting like other populations.
In the end, after countless cycles or even millions of years, the two populations will become different entities and will no longer be called the same creatures.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and an important driving force of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale (this is what happens when you breathe out).
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
We build our houses from plants and our clothes are made from plants as well. Plants are mostly what we eat. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was a fearsome predator in its time, so nothing frightened it, only other mosasaurs.
Her long jaw was full of lamps, with 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the roof of her mouth, meaning nothing could escape once it crossed her path.
It's certain we don't know for sure, but perhaps it had a forked tongue. What it ate included shells, large fish, other marine reptiles, and perhaps even this one was a cannibal.
He attacks anything that goes into the water, even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex wouldn't survive against him.
While we may be familiar with the simplicity of their food, the Romans also had elaborate and luxurious festive items, including roasted pig, peacock, oysters, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the common people and women ate their food while sitting on the floor, the rich wanted to gather together where they were sheltered from the sun while eating their food.
The traditional foods of Rome do not include the foods that arrived in Europe from America or from Asia in recent centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which they believed to be the dwelling place of the deity.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priesthood will be responsible for providing the gods’ needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard of the temple and an inner sanctuary that only the priesthood may enter.
Sometimes, special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house isn't important.
The focus of the life of the Hebrew family happened outside.
The woman is cooking a thousand [things]; the stores are open like mats seen on the road. Stone is used for building a house.
There were no large trees in the land of Canaan, that’s why wood was so expensive.
Few people live in Greenland. Norse stories say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while sailing further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even with its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there during that time.
Even though 'Scandinavian' all the countries are, there are differences among the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But, this isn't true. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, this isn't a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The texts can be seen at the bottom of the document, reversed.
While no one is certain who actually wrote it, it is believed that early in his life, the large, written document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Perhaps the notation was simply added as a label.
The landings of D-Day and the following days liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
This was commanded by the "Vichy" French. These were the French people who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and worked for them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture characterized by a significant large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word *civilis*, meaning civil, which relates to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, and in the same way illustrates the scale of society.
City-states are the origin of nations. A culture of civilization tells the story of the transmission of knowledge to several generations, a continuing cultural legacy and just inheritance.
The richness of indigenous cultures is diminishing, leaving behind no evidence related to history and failing to be recognized as worthy civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—composed of a Congress—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacks any power to enforce taxes, and, lacking an executive or judicial branch, it relies on state authorities, who sometimes do not cooperate, to implement all of its ordinances.
They still lack the authority to prevent laws on taxes and tariffs between states.
The Articles require the full consent of all states before they are amended, and the states only allow the central government to act when their representatives are absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international matches and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because Japan is comprised of a cluster/group of islands, it is appropriate to call Japan, in terms of geographical location, an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan began as early as the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or “Beautiful Island.”
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift in native rice production activities and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, named Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The buildings around the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size during the decline of the analog film era.
This is still done today, but its aspect ratio is more important, following the formats of digital camera image sensors.
Actually, the 35mm format is quite confusing—it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is commonly stated as 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) are cropped or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The excess of abuse and measured laws of the third are the simple guide to creating dynamism while maintaining a sense of smoothness in an image.
It is being suggested that the most effective location for the main resource is the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion used the states of Europe behind the differences in language and customs.
The source of all power affects everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the primary beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are for that very purpose.
The center of authority of the church is in Rome, for nearly two thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raises many questions as to whether this belief is being fulfilled.
Unable to find any immediate benefit from the devastation of the war, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off important military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated some generally accepted international laws established by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire section of the sea, posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
Because there was a limited supply of this ammunition, Germany developed a similar ammunition for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing customs of the former inhabitants and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations aspired to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to seek a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his first job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different points in time; each Chinese state or each family in power was a different dynasty.
And yet, within each dynasty, there was a period of instability in the frontier provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
In those times, fierce battles occurred between many ambitious contenders fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was among the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, with countless people dying in the struggle to ascend to the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not just to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were opened for all male applicants who possessed the most ambitious and successful aspirations.
It's still the same for the military because instead of military ranks being based on merit, they are now based on connections.
The French Revolution continued to inspire many other working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was interested in things beyond this worldly life. He would go to a cave that became known as “Hira’” on Mount “Noor” (approximately) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, provides a clear image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the peak of a mountain in the north of Mecca, the cave is truly isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, it’s not easy to believe even if one knows it exists. Once it’s inside the cave, separation is complete.
There was nothing to be seen but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, has several pyramids (where the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The "up bow" mark looks like a V and the "down bow" mark looks like a staple or square without a line at its lower part.
To draw the bow, you need to start at the top and push it down, and to lower it, you need to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and loosen the bow.
The up-bow creates a softer sound, while the down-bow is louder and more forceful.
Don't hesitate to add your own markings, but remember that the printed markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
Forced to return were the fearful King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King’s sister, Madam Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789 from Versailles due to a tumultuous group of women in the market.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a tumultuous crowd of people shouting and brandishing threats against the King and Queen.
The warring group of people pressured the King and Queen to open the window of their carriage.
Once, a member of a riotous group brandished the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The costs of the U.S. imperialist war during the occupation of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover a large portion of the expenses and the interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the large profits gained from the later exploitation of Filipinos will surpass the foremost victims of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period during which the events most commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages occurred is a time in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is the term that encompasses a broad range of ideas, from techno-utopianism or necessary technology to the strict definition that human destiny is driven under the logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The dominant interpretations of technological determinism generally follow two flawed ideas: that technological development itself follows a path independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology has “effects” on societies as inherent qualities, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, there’s an argument that the development of motor vehicles should lead to the improvement of roads.
However, the entire national network cannot sustain itself economically for just a few cars, since new methods of manufacturing have advanced to reduce the cost of ownership.
The increasing ownership of cars leads to a high incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn necessitates the invention of new methods of treatment for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, rising within the realm of society, proved superior to the established, imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its recognition as a starting point of power began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Her state flourished during the twelfth century due to the fact that the Crusades brought back gifts such as silk and spices more valuable than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
That was the time when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the mid-10th to 11th and 14th centuries.
From the beginning, the influence of Byzantine culture on clothing in the East was very great.
However, due to the slow means of communication, Western styles arrive here 25 to 30 years late.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest achievements of the period, as a result of the Crusades, was the start of people using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done for the production of food just enough to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, traditionally organic system that utilizes locally available resources within an ecoregion, employing crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, the majority of farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures thrive on like-minded individuals who experience frustration with societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of belonging.
Subcultures can vary due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture—distinct perhaps linguistically, aesthetically, religiously, politically, sexually, geographically, or a combination of these.
Subcultures are defined by their members' demonstration of belonging through a distinct and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and unique slang.
One of the most common ways used to demonstrate the importance of child protection is to present several heartbreaking cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not protected by adults while they were growing up.
Children like that are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are taken in by people (often by their own families); in some cases, this abandonment of children is due to parents rejecting them because of severe intellectual or physical defects.
Troubled youth may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others are rumored to have lived solely for themselves in old age.
If raised by non-human animals, the feral child displays behaviors (within physical limitations) that are almost entirely similar to those of the particular nurturing animal, such as its fearfulness or wariness of people.
While project-based learning makes studying easier and more interesting, scaffolding has been added a little more.
Scaffolding isn’t a way of learning itself, but rather assistance that provides support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, meaning a teacher is one form of scaffolding, but so is a simple paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
The Virtual Scaffolds are integrated into a software and designed to ask questions, clarify, and explain methods that might help students work independently.
Young people are placed in Foster Care for many different reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even abandonment.
No child should grow up in an environment that is neglectful, abusive, and uneducational, but that is how it is for them.
We see the Foster Care System as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe environments, loving caregivers, dependable education, and consistent health care.
Foster care should provide all the necessities lacking in the original home from which the children were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique nature of the internet has led to an increased level of restraint in its use and strategy for providing enjoyment.
For example, “information seeking” and “social companionship” were suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal relevance” and “ongoing relationship” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation in their investigation of consumer reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting subtle expressions, facial cues that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by accurately interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, described how people with brain damage couldn't understand the speech, but could still perceive the sincerity within it.
He was still pondering whether such a skill in interpreting human behavior might also be given to animals, like intelligent chickens.
Research in the twentieth century shows that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and revealed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, which selection removes from the pool of expressed variation.
The cycles of separation and reconciliation create variation in the back-and-forth between the two groups with each generation.
Out in the savanna, look for a primate with a digestive system like humans that can obtain the necessary amino acids from the local plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do this has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest plant-based sources to obtain are proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
Conversely, insect-based foods (grubs, termites, beetles) are not easily digestible, but still provide a high amount of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the rather crude way that chimpanzees do today.
Sleep inertia is a process of temporary grogginess or reduced alertness immediately after waking up during your normal sleep time and falling back asleep shortly after (10–60 minutes).
This is easily done by using a very loud alarm clock to gently wake you up instead of fully startling you awake.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm on your phone while you're still sleepy, you could put it across the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Some options based on biorhythms include drinking a lot of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing one to urinate.
The amount of relaxation inside with a person is the opposite of the amount of tension in the body and spirit of a person.
The less tension, the more positive forces are present in life. Everyone has the potential to find a deep and lasting contentment.
Everyone is capable of achieving peace. What often hinders us on the path to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is enriched by the Mahayana path of compassion and numerous techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is simple. It combines with Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal compassionate love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of the serpent) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. Through the visualization of various deities, energy pathways are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of well-being is achieved.
Germany was a major adversary during World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to the fall of nations.
Two years after the war, former allies became adversaries and the Cold War began.
This will end with the next 40 years of genuine conflict, through succeeding generations of soldiers, in battlefields ranging from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered useless within a single night, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most effective way currently to carry large quantities of people and things across the seas.
The job of the navy in the past was to ensure that your country maintains the ability to transport its people and things, while at the same time, disrupting the ability of your opponent to transport their people and things.
One of the most challenging recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, where Americans worked to deliver people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, began to interrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, perhaps Germany would have been able to conquer Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were domesticated and cared for as early as 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes initiated the practice of skinning them for the quick acquisition of milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Typically, live goats are placed in pens on sloping hills or other open areas, usually tended by young shepherds or youths, similar to more well-known herders. This method of herding is still used today.
The railways were established in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the railcars were made only of the same kind of wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve faster speeds and to haul larger loads compared to the somewhat more difficult roads of the past.
Cross ties were initially used to secure the tracks in the area. However, it was gradually discovered that the tracks would be better if they had a steel component on top.
This job became common, but the metal caused more destruction to the things made on the wooden frames of the wagons.
In the beginning, wooden rails were replaced with iron rails. In 1767, the first completely iron rail was introduced.
The first known form of transportation is walking. People began walking approximately two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (upright man).
Those who came before them, the Australopithecus did not walk upright like those that came later.
Evidence of bipedal specialization can be found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet even earlier, as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living in harmony with the environment, we can help with environmental conservation, and we can even become activists to lessen future suffering in certain areas.
This is like a symptom of treatment in many cases. But if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to identify the root of the problems, and we need to eliminate them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes due to human advancements in science and technology, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of people.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, an original handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent by several blocks to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, and are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the belfry of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and it was read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides, which are still known to exist, are the earliest remaining copies of the document. The original handwritten manuscript did not survive.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about ancient priests that are still like dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws and scales, they strut, and they walk using their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulating information in the coded form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are designated as binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
Dizziness inside can be immediately seen. The symptoms, such as vomiting, often indicate that a quick diagnosis cannot be made.
The most common sign of indoor poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medicine or poisonous chemicals in the house.
Look for the label for specific instructions for that specific thread.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists with a formal definition for this group of insects.
This term was taken from the familiar "Sudlot," insects well-known as parasites of humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are parasitic, adapted to live on the host's skin or in the host's dwelling.
Throughout the United States of America, there are an estimated 400,000 diagnosed cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A couple can decide to have a child not for their own best interest, or for the interest of their children, but simply because.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights as parents so that another couple can become the child’s parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works in a scientific way. This method of proof guides many scientific investigations.
Even if this isn’t theorizing, experimentation, and the experiment is a method used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questioning, and making observations, it still guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's contributions are acknowledged in all discussions of science, including psychology.
As Greek awareness declined, the West perceived its own origins as lost from its philosophical and scientific beginnings.
Many rhythms have been observed in physiology and behavior that generally depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented in a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycling, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have varying effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, as well as the plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include birdwatching, fishing, taking photographs, observing wildlife, and visiting parks and learning information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photos, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people in the small town would leave in their cars to go to their workplaces, passing by others whose work destination turned out to be the place they had abandoned.
This isn't dynamic shuttle transportation; it is largely connected and supportive of a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science has shown that the largest carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone witnessed it in society and used transportation systems. Almost everyone complained about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints at the same level regarding water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems cause complaints like these, and why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something else going on?
The Science of Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
It's unfortunate, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
It is good that drivers likely operate within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flow is likely to have some reasonable similarities and can be presented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three leading variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in the planning, design, and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more quickly and find food and mates more easily.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their claws back into their bodies.
It provides them with a larger share of the small space to hide from their attackers.
In that case, only those insects that do not fold their wings, such as flies, dragonflies, and mayflies, are like that.
Many years ago, like a man named Aristarchus who proposed that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Few people believe that he is right, but many people believe the opposite—that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This is quite understandable, because it’s not known that the Earth is round, isn’t it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is still the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Approximately 20 percent of the freshwater that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River, the largest river, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from numerous small streams.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the dimensions of the Giza pyramids and the technical skill of their construction were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom of the ancient Egyptians focused on their earlier monuments, which were already over a century old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. This is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The City of Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian remains the everyday language used by most workers in the state, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All those who flock to Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about leading chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these can be discovered in the environment in native form and are relatively easy to extract using ancient tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory that everything in the universe is made of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is very similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he still proposes a theory that these change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are usually made by mixing two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
The elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can still have alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. Everything is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The incredible number of atoms, trillions of them, could fit into the period at the end of these words.
Indeed, the pencil was a good companion to many people when it came out.
It is saddening that as new writing methods develop, the pencil has been relegated to a shorter and less utilized state.
People now are writing messages on the computer screen, they no longer need to approach a telegraph operator.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when a newer one arrives.
A fission bomb works on the principle of requiring energy to overcome the forces holding a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It felt like the rattling of a carriage on a hill. The re-centering back to the nucleus is what releases some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they easily decay or split with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick in the continental areas and 100 km thick in the oceanic areas.
This is thinner under the sea and more numerous under the mountains.
Perhaps there is still magma in the surrounding area because the crust is thinner there. It’s easier for lava to rise to the surface.
The theories of content are centered on understanding what captures people's attention or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have needs and/or desires that are applied while they are at the right age or maturity level.
These theories converge on the idea that people’s desires drive their actions, and what in their environment can cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Overall, two approaches can emerge as managers prioritize their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is simply choosing to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager excels at making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the far end of the spectrum, one can become an unrecognized individual who feels the need to change everything the group is doing and do it their own way.
At the end of the day, the leader is the most responsible for the success and failure of the group.
This practice often results in misunderstandings between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of performance as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
The members of the virtual team often serve as the point of contact for their respective physical groups.
They usually have more autonomy compared to the more junior team members because their team might be spread across different time zones, which their local manager might not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is still a distinct characteristic of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the steering group where each member reports to. The invisible team sets expectations for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process when establishing an organization for research? A purpose for training in organizational awareness concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized throughout all functional departments within an organization, creativity and innovation can happen.
As a result, the process of an organization striving to overcome a challenge can lead to new, innovative processes to deliver customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as foster expertise and knowledge within the organization.
According to Angel (2006), the Continuum approach is a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating consciousness, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It was later discovered that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information to create simulation models that can help us understand the processes in our minds.
Even though AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI is forming one of the most important branches of computer science, involving behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Along with AI research is the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Included in the examples are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to accept customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice and facial expressions.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as evidenced by their presence in some home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Teachers often want to take their students to places where a bus ride isn't an option.
Technology provides solutions for virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Conducting a virtual field trip is still a good way to showcase a journey and experiences in future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital; the website’s content is updated annually, but older versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs still help improve students’ writing. Even if students often begin writing their experiences on blogs with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience overall changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to make their writing clear to avoid criticism.
Blogging still “pushes students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them.” The need to capture audience interest inspires students to be knowledgeable and engaging. (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively engaging with materials on the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of others’ writings as well as outline their own understandings of specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south of Niagara Falls and to the north lies the gateway to the still unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and many more are what promote Ontario as what outsiders consider to be truly Canadian.
The large areas in the north don't have much population, and some have almost no elderly residents.
To compare the populations that were combined in quantity: More African Americans live in the US than the number of Filipinos in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and a continent on its own when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the small islands are independent nations, or dependencies of France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Islam was still propagated by the Arabs, and it was adopted to a large extent in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Woman: It is recommended that any woman who travels should say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It would still be helpful to wear a ring (it doesn’t have to be expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment, and things like common greetings, a pat on the arm, and others.
Be strong in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, this is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt under the name Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
Long ago, the sultan of Morocco founded the city as Daru I-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the not very interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it’s easier to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of souvenirs, but all of this is geared towards tourists.
Goma, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a city of tourists located in the easternmost part, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the town's roads, especially the town center.
Since Goma remains a safe area, any visits outside of Goma still need to be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city remains a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, alongside some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Accompanied by a relative sense of dread regarding it, "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for the remote, a haunting reality.
Today, Timbuktu is a remote town, even though its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to threats from desert locusts.
This was one of the featured stops during Henry Louis Gates’s special Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city is situated in a strong contrast to other cities in the country, because it has a larger Arab population compared to African populations.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and lies along the border with Mozambique to the north, and the northern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is situated within 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
This is a leading attraction in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there is a daily conservation fee and an entrance fee to the park.
It’s still possible for someone to qualify with a Wild Card, which provides entry to any of the parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the area most often visited by tourists as a primary focus.
The array of buildings creating the Hong Kong skyline is likened to a dense bar chart reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong's skyline, go to the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across from it.
The significant development of Hong Kong Island province is largely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place seized by the British colonizers as their own, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest tidally influenced halophytic mangrove forest in the world, extending for 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the territory of India is called Sundarbans National Park.
Even the elders here are not unaware—they are among the few remaining reminders that stand of the great antiquity that once occupied the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², where approximately one-third is covered by water/land erosion.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, even if there are many, especially those going east, and the Jakar/Bumthang buses leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Because inter-district buses are usually full, it is common to book tickets several days in advance.
The older districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to remote places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, have a length of 378 meters, and feature two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge was scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, just as the completion of customs checkpoints in Brazil was expected.
The Guarani are the most important group of indigenous people inhabiting present-day Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and gatherers who are still skilled in agriculture.
The Chaco region was the refuge of other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through conquest, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish colonization period, which lasted for three centuries, began with the arrival of the Spaniards.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has continuously preserved its many native customs and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the most competitive teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Larger tournaments and competitions can still be found here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at any bank on the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands and within the Stanley credit card network, and US dollars are still commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, even if British and US currency is; it’s best to inquire with owners in advance to understand what payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands money outside the islands, so exchange your money first before traveling to the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it experiences winter when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures commonly rise above +30°C.
Cold can feel much colder: temperatures rarely drop in the cold, but the wind and humidity contribute to making it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Even though there are many animals in the park and you can see people around, wildlife should still be respected and not fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must remain at least 100 yards/meters away from bears or wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Even if they are kind and generous, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, a dozen visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Furthermore, it is known that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly-smelling foods and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of around 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a violent gathering in the village resulted in the murder of the most important leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland landing on two shores. The most famous are in three locations.
The North Shore coastline (in the North Harbour district) faces the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are rocky and not good for swimming, and there’s a lot of shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive lead to Waitemata Harbour, above the market towns of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is a beautiful beach perfect for families, with many shops lined up along the shore. Swimming is prohibited.
The leading local beer is 'Number One', it’s not a complicated beer, but rather enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be drunk, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easily available if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is an 'espresso', cappuccino is full of cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is based on Belgian standards. Fruit jams are expensive but have little flavor.
Numerous trips to the reefs are made throughout the year, and damage to the reefs due to any cause is rare.
Even so, still seek guidance from authorities, follow all instructions, and pay attention to safety reminders.
Box jellyfish appear near shorelines and near the river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770. They are sometimes seen outside of these periods.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles here are not commonly found in the ocean, their main habitat is in the river estuaries north from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing they will have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents usually have deals with specific hotels, but you might also find that it’s possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include meals, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can still hold the reservation for you if you need more time to consider the offer or gather other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For many festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp on site, and many attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a camping site near the music.
I understand that even if the music stops in the main parts [of the event], perhaps there will still be parts of the party where music will continue to be played until the middle of the night.
Many festivals have a special camping area for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in the depths of winter, determine the cabin's location, because traveling on the ice will cause terrifying sounds for those most affected.
Included in trips to Saint Petersburg is time in town. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos generally create many distractions to increase the time and money spent by visitors. They often have no windows or clocks, and it is difficult to tell the time.
Typically, they have special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay.
Many places offer intoxicating drinks at home. Likewise, intoxication impairs judgment, and everyone knows that good judgment is important for staying of sound mind.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
When roads are icy with snow, friction is reduced and you can't drive as fast as you would on asphalt.
During a blizzard, the right amount of snow to trap you can fall in a short amount of time.
Visibility can still be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues with hardly any interruptions throughout the year.
The safari parks are among the biggest and most attractive tourist destinations in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to journeys to the land to see the fascinating wildlife of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Tall animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are often seen in vehicles and standard equipment will allow for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes camouflaged, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or going "footing") consists of hiking, which can be done within a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only city in Asia that has hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies differ, but in late March, many of the coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not take effect until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that the majority of tickets to the event will range in price between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for guests to use, even if there isn't one present in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Do not let the fabric get too hot, as it could cause burns (or, in severe cases, a fire).
There are various ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, collecting water takes only a minute, while in others, several minutes are needed.

The stirrups are the support for the feet of the rider who is seated below or on either side of the saddle.
They offer more stability for the rider, but there may be concerns about safety due to the potential for riders' feet to get trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but one foot is caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To lessen this risk, many safety precautions should be taken.
Indeed, many riders were wearing riding boots with heels and spurs, and relatively short shafts.
Next, modern saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that provide a path for a leather seat to fall with the saddle if pulled back by a fallen rider.

Under good conditions, you can cover a greater distance by skiing than by walking – but you’ll rarely get the thrill of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on well-groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means going through many visa applications and passport controls multiple times.

A rip current is a strong, narrow current flowing outwards from the shore, typically through a break in the waves or near a sandbar or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topography, the return current is concentrated in certain deeper areas, and the fast current can be diverted downwards into the deep water there.
Many deaths are happening as a result of exhaustion in the effort to swim back against the current, which can make it impossible.
When the tide goes out and you're far from shore, swimming back is harder than usual.
