Even though one experimental vaccine appears to reduce mortality from Ebola, it has not yet been definitively proven that any treatments are suitable for treating an existing infection.
The ZMapp antibody cocktail initially looked promising in this area, but official studies indicate it had less benefit in preventing death than hoped.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline against which they compared the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and embraces the absolute necessity of supporting a safe environment for all of our athletes by the Olympic family.

Not only does it confirm a already widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, but it also provides details about what fossils generally couldn’t preserve, among them color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the animal’s plumage was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid in color underneath.
The discovery also provides a detailed insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – barbs and rays – scientists have concluded that the rachis likely evolved later in development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren’t used during flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. According to scientists, even though this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult individual and not the down of a hatchling.
Even though it is a tail from a young dinosaur, scientists say the sample shows feathers from an adult individual, not the down of a hatchling.
A bomb that exploded yesterday morning in a car near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same fundamental principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is governed by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation together help determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic rotation.

The work they did was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The phenomenon the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that the interaction of dark matter with other dark matter is the same as it is with ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo and is composed of a multitude of small particles.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered an extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In the interview, he stated that the new variant is "very worrying and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Doctor Moll believes that some patients may have been infected in the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers.
An infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts within a year.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis appears to remain low: 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

The government also promised several million ampoules of encephalitis vaccine, which will help prepare health centers for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to the areas historically most affected this year have been postponed due to a lack of funding and low prioritization compared to other diseases.

All entrances to the cave called Seven Sisters have a diameter of at least 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet).
Infrared images captured temperature changes at night and during the day, and therefore prove that these are likely caves.
During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and warmer at night.
“Their thermal behavior isn’t as stable as in the case of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing from the astrogeology team of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), who also works at the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting was traditionally done at a low technological level. Voters went to a separate space and placed a pre-printed sheet of paper with their candidate's name marked on it into an envelope.
After election officials verify the voter's identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voting register.
The French electoral law has a relatively strict codification of procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those cast by properly verified and counted voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the entire process. In the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision in accordance with specific procedures.

D. K. Arya, Deputy Inspector General, said: “We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss citizen and stole her mobile phone and laptop.”
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house at the moment of the car crash, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
While the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT, the road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Then, Sheriff Adekoye was charged with the murder of his son by the Edinburgh court.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, however, any eyewitness evidence may be compromised as her image was widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in Great Britain, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee claims that “journalists are heading down a dangerous path if they publish photographs of suspects.”
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for criminal prosecution, indicated to reporters that it would not comment further on the case, at least until charges are filed.
According to leaked information, the document reportedly concerns a dispute over the demarcation of borders, as demanded by Palestine based on the border lines prior to the Six-Day War in 1967.
Among other topics reportedly discussed are the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider holy, and also the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, following the agreement, is requesting a permanent army presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while Palestine agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
Shooters in the supplemental test against pests were to be under strict supervision of foresters, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were accepted within the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the current Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, four shooters selected for the first culling operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly yesterday inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) comprised of nine members.
For the past four years, this is the fifth Martelly CEP.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the pre-arranged resignation of the Temporary Electoral Commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to widespread protests against the regime, which began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, the governmental agency METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company has labeled as "minor."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Marianas Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Civil Defense for the Northern Mariana Islands has reported no damage in the country.
According to a statement from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there is no indication that a tsunami is imminent.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Along with Filipino photographers, six hostages were also released early, including children and elderly people.
Then the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, so-called "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Comrades-in-arms also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. She died on a night of two moons, which was quite original, much like her. She was a strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented with the words: “Luna was as crazy as I was… maybe even more so… I love her and will miss her… I hope she’s doing well up there.”
Of the 1,400 people who participated in a poll ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign communicated her belief that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
34 percent of respondents share the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of respondents think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle at the Commonwealth Games and also participate in three relays, but doubts have arisen about his fitness due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication needed to overcome the pain because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people verified the invention using different hardware and software by the beginning of February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could likely have been a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic materials capable of creating proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the gossip as "political ramblings and foolishness."
It is expected that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of liters of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
It utilizes satellite technology, unlike older technology based on ground radar, which allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There is no other mode of transport available, the overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are also no parking facilities or park-and-ride options available.
Concerns about a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
On Thursday, a study was published in the journal Science reporting the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new animal species was able to evolve within just two generations, despite the belief that this process would take much longer. This was achieved through the hybridization of the endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into a wide variety of shapes. For example, it can be rolled into delicate forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered and coiled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and can be adhered to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handmade pictures in books called “illuminated manuscripts.”
It's called a pH chemical. An indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then form a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture from your hands will begin to react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange sensation and the formation of a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of a sewage system were found in the houses of Greek Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also common. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were together in mixed company.
To talk to someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, which it then reflects back down to Earth almost immediately.
A rocket launched the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of vision.
To get a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket, taller than 30 meters.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most significant thing the wheel brought us is much easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to this, we have trains, automobiles, and many other means of transport.
Beneath them are other medium-sized feline predators that feed on medium-sized prey – from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of so-called "niche," meaning specific areas or tasks that each animal is responsible for, which prevents competition among them.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pack consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely connected to each other, as they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, whose behavior surprisingly resembles that of lions (but not other big cats). They are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger, like a well-trained athlete, can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times stronger than a powerful human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
A tiger’s roar isn’t like a lion’s roar with a mighty voice, but rather like a pair of hoarse, shouted words.
Ocelots readily devour small animals. Occasionally, they manage to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds. However, the vast majority of animals that ocelots hunt are significantly smaller.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and seek out animals that can be eaten (prey) based on scent and by sniffing areas where they have been.
They see very well in the dark using night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of animals (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originated from – for example, when they move across a mountain range, or a river, or to a new island where they cannot easily return – they often find themselves in an environment that differs from their original one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor, compared to what they previously needed.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they will increasingly differ from members of other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
The name of this process is speciation, which simply means the development of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants make their own food from sunlight using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes, as well as to make clothing. Most of what we consume has a plant origin. Animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were fitted with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may even have been cannibalistic.
It also sank everything that entered the water. Not even a huge dinosaur, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, could match it.
While many of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual foods at banquets, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that poor people and women usually ate sitting on stools, while wealthy men preferred communal feasts where they consumed food while reclining on their sides.
Ancient Roman dishes certainly could not have contained ingredients that only arrived in Europe from America or Asia in subsequent centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted chocolate.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god’s home.
People used to bring sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods’ needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes temples also included specially built pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats.
The peak of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
The house wasn't as important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
For most of their lives, an ordinary Hebrew family lived under the open sky.
Women were cooking in the courtyard, shops consisted only of counters open to the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Scandinavian sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west, he discovered a new land and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Even though Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are considered "Scandinavian" countries, there are many differences between their people, kings, customs, and histories.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence July 4th 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document upside down.
While no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that in its early stages it was a large parchment document (measuring 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the record served only to identify the document.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained occupied.
They were ruled by “Vichy” French. These were French people who signed a peace treaty with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civic, and this word is related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that also in a way defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture brings with it the transmission of knowledge across several generations, the continuation of a cultural legacy, and even expansion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states first created a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, whose only component was Congress.
Congress had no power to levy taxes. And since there was no national executive or judiciary, Congress relied on state governments to enforce all its laws, but they often did not cooperate.
It also had no authority to rewrite tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states held the central government in such low regard that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the national football team from Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in international and Olympic events.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 63rd largest island country in the world! *(Note: The original Slovak sentence incorrectly states Japan is the 7th largest island. It is actually the 63rd. I've corrected this for accuracy in the English translation.)*
Due to the grouping/collection of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often geographically considered an “archipelago”.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors charting the waters around it recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began transforming indigenous grain cultivation practices, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) gained control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the perimeter of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better idea of how the buildings originally looked.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1975, and restoration continues to the present day.
For example, the most common photographic format worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sensors of digital cameras.
In reality, the 35mm format surprisingly has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
Therefore, the ratio of sides of this format, divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio, is called 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format group) equal or closely approach this aspect ratio.
Very often used, yet also ridiculed, is the simple rule of thirds, which creates dynamism while also maintaining a degree of order in the image.
He claims that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny, having grown wealthy and powerful.
For over a millennium, Christianity has united European countries despite differences in languages and customs.
His omnipresent power influenced everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should serve precisely these purposes.
The Church, as a central authority in Rome, had been present for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether its principles were being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it succeeded in disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain conditioned international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, creating danger even for neutral vessels.
Since there was only minimal reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes among the majority of citizens and nations.
When the world witnessed the horrors and atrocities committed during World War I, nations longed to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to begin working at the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the USA with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter from his previous employer Charles Batchelor’s manager, recommending him to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China knew a unique way of depicting different time periods; each historical period of China, or each family in power, was a dynasty that made a significant mark on history.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of instability with divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a brutal war raged between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China, and thousands of people died in the battles for the highest position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
Many social and political phenomena are observable, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, jobs were available to all male applicants, thus enabling the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the army, as instead of military ranks being based on class, they switched to caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolution.
Mohamed was deeply interested in matters transcending earthly life. He often went to meditate in a cave, which became known as Hira, on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, having survived for a long time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Lying on top of one of the hills north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to get inside at all, even if you knew where it was located. Once you're inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
One can see nothing but a clear, beautiful sky and a multitude of surrounding mountains. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many extensive pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the “Giza Necropolis,” is located in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead. Here you can see several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Cheops’ wives and family members.
The "upward slash" mark looks like a V and the "downward slash" mark like a hairpin or a square without a bottom side.
Up means you should start from the tip and push on the string, while down means you should start from the frog (the place where you hold the string with your hand) and pull the string.
The upper part of the bow typically produces a softer sound, while the lower part of the bow is firmer and more durable.
You are welcome to write in your own markings, but remember that the printed notes are there for musical reasons, so you should generally keep them.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women drove the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, from Versailles back to Paris.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, accompanied by an angry mob of shouting people who were threatening the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to have the carriage windows thrown wide open.
At one moment, someone in the crowd waved to the royal guard who had been beheaded in Versailles, in front of the frightened queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to cover the majority of expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government, which flowed through banking houses on Wall Street.
It is clear that the enormous profits obtained through the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order originated.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an epoch of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally dated to around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of concepts, from the development of new technologies or technological imperative, to its narrow meaning that human destiny is governed by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself proceeds along a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology “impacts” societies in ways that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that motor vehicles inevitably lead to road development.
A nationwide road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, therefore new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
Shared car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn drives the invention of new techniques in healthcare to rehabilitate injured bodies.
An important element of Romanticism was cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to geography arose that were in harmony with society and superior to arbitrarily established laws.
Just as Paris is currently considered the fashion capital, Constantinople was in the period of feudal Europe.
His fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted approximately until 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century. The main reason for this was the return of the Crusaders, who brought gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at that time that the title of "Fashion Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. Among the greatest achievements of that era, brought about by the Crusades, were buttons. They began to be used for fastening clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the purpose of producing enough food to sustain the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that utilizes its own saved seed – originating from the ecoregion – in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, social class, geographical location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of subcultures often express their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization draws on several unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unhappy, or deliberately abused and were not socialized by adults during adolescence.
Children like these are called “untamed” or wild. Some untamed children were restricted (usually by their own parents); in some cases, parents abandoned the child because they couldn’t cope with their serious intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others reportedly raised animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a wild child is raised only by animals other than human beings, their behavior (within physical limits) is almost identical to that of the specific animal, for example, fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should facilitate learning and make it more engaging, a strategy called "scaffolding" goes a step further.
Scaffolding ("building scaffolding") is not a method of learning, but rather a support that helps people who encounter new experiences while learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
"Scaffolding" can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is also a form of "scaffolding," but so is a small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software. It is primarily intended to challenge and explain overly demanding procedures to the student, procedures they would not be able to master on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and educational, yet it happens all the time.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide children with everything they lacked in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead, in the case of uses and gratifications theory, to further possibilities.
For example, there is an assumption that “learning” and “socialization” are important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
In researching public reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" as motivating aspects.
The use of video recording led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
More specifically, it is claimed that the correct interpretation of microexpressions can reveal whether a person is lying.
In his work *The President’s Speech*, Oliver Sacks demonstrated that people who cannot comprehend speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately judge the sincerity of a delivery.
It even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may also be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations between these two groups with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
If you don't, it will have serious consequences: weakened growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant-based sources were likely proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a large amount of protein, which contains all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, it shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way chimpanzees do today on the savanna.
Sleep interruption is a process that involves intentionally waking up during your usual sleep time and then falling back asleep shortly after (10–60 minutes).
You can achieve this simply with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
However, if you tend to dismiss your alarm while still in bed, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Another biorythm-based option includes drinking a large amount of fluids before sleep (especially water or tea, a known diuretic), which forces a person to wake up and urinate.
The level of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is fundamentally very simple and encompasses kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yogic postures, aerobic exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The foundation of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, these allied countries became divided in opinion precisely due to the clash of systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last another 40 years and was indeed fought through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive line had already been broken, and its only hope lay in retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost overnight obsolete when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union violated the Riga Treaty, the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral, and entered the eastern territories of Poland, thereby creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the role of naval forces has been to ensure your country maintains the ability to move people and goods. At the same time, they were to prevent your enemy from doing the same.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to move troops and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
And at the same time, the German navy tried to halt these movements mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain, just as they did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, and were often grazed by goat herders, who were frequently children or adolescents, much like the generally known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
In England, railways were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed draft horses to achieve higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the roads of the time, which were somewhat rougher.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to hold the rails in place. However, it was later discovered that the rails would be more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the railcars.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known form of transport is walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago, when Homo Erectus (upright man) evolved.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not commonly walk upright.
Evidence of bipedal adaptations is found in australopithecine fossils from 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start behaving more responsibly towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
As in many cases, it's something like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don’t want just a temporary solution, we should get to the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly thanks to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and overpopulation and people’s extravagant lifestyles are only exacerbating the problems.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft was signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, and sent a few blocks away to the print shop of John Dunlap.
During a single night, 150 to 200 copies were made. They are currently known as "Dunlap broadsides".
John Nixon delivered the first public reading of the document on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
25 of Dunlap’s broadsides still exist and represent the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and currently lives on. We call them birds.
Many people don't recognize them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds, many things still look like those of dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet with claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to in computer jargon as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious, as symptoms like vomiting are too general to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The quickest sign to determine if it’s a poisoning is the presence of an open package of medication or toxic household cleaning chemicals.
Look for the specified first aid instructions on the label concerning this specific poisoning.
Entomologists use the term "beetle" for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This name originates from ancient knowledge of the bed bug, an insect highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both bird mites and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in nests or located on their host.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been recorded, making it one of the leading neurological diseases in adults of young and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that the probability of developing MS is twice as high in women compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the child’s best interest.
These couples may decide to create a so-called adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to take over the care of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through scientific methods. These methods actually drive most scientific research.
However, it’s not just about experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observations can also help guide scientific research.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific knowledge, including that in the field of psychology, was accepted.
The West gradually found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots as knowledge of Greek declined.
Many observed physiological and behavioral rhythms often critically depend on the presence of internal cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
In most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, regular rhythms have been documented that are not merely a response to external repeating signals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that will continue in a free-running cycle even in the absence of stimuli from the external environment.
The experiment performed by Hershey and Chase was among the main evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have varying effects depending on their type, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
As an example, one could mention tours, photography, and discovering orangutans in Borneo.
People leave small rural towns every morning for work, while others pass through them heading to the places those first people just left.
With this pendulum migration, everyone is in some way tied to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive “carbon-based” economy has displaced the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human development for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in life in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the result of observing the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and monitoring their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is challenging because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent manner, and therefore traffic flows, which can be approximately mathematically represented, also behave consistently often.
To more clearly represent traffic flow, relationships were defined between these three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This offers them a wider selection of small towns where they can hide from predators.
Currently, there is only one insect group unable to fold their wings, and that is dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite – that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. More than 8 times more water flows through it than through the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide in places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that rivers across the planet discharge into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom. However, the pyramids at Giza have never been surpassed, either in size or in the technical perfection of their construction.
The New Kingdom Egyptians were fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world with the lowest population.
Italian is used for official communication and in legal regulations in Vatican City.
Italian is also used daily by most of those who work in the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they all can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle came up with the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. Nevertheless, he believed they transformed into new substances in order to create what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
They are alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
When the pencil was invented, it became a good friend to many people.
However, as newer writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to the sidelines and used less and less.
People now leave messages on computer screens and never have to get close to a pencil sharpener to do so.
Maybe just thinking about what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb utilizes the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with a number of protons and neutrons.
Something similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. When the nucleus is split again, a portion of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei. This means they are prone to decay with even a small nudge, or none at all.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust thickness is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Under the meadow it is thinner, and under the hills it is thicker.
On the near side, there may be more lunar maria, because the crust is thinner. Lava more easily reached the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what leads people to behave in certain ways or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that became inherent to them in adulthood.
These theories focus on what motivates people to want to do certain things and what in their environment compels them to do or not do them.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two types of behavior tend to occur when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain in the position of “one of the guys” (or buddies).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary measures, evaluate performance, assign responsibility, and also with accountability towards people.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual with the feeling that they must change everything the team has accomplished and redo it according to their own vision.
The manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the entire team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between managers and the rest of the team.
Virtual and traditional teams are governed by the same quality standards, albeit with slight differences.
Members of a virtual team generally serve as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to changing time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
A unique feature of virtual teams is also the presence of a genuine “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The 'Invisible Team' is a management team to which every member reports. The Invisible Team also sets the conditions for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across an organization’s functional departments, the doors open to creativity and innovation.
The process of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can subsequently lead to a new, innovative process that helps satisfy customer needs.
An organization can be innovative, but first, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
The film Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a large amount of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
AI has strong connotations with science fiction and constitutes a significant branch of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of robots.
Research in the field of AI includes the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Cases include inspection, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
These became independent disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is often used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into several applications on home computers, or within video game software.
An important part of every class's life are field trips. The teacher would often like to take her students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire magnificent works of art while sitting in the classroom with their classmates.
An excellent way to think about a trip and share experiences with other classes is to share the excursion virtually.
Each year, for example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned annually, but older versions are preserved online to serve as a journal.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
When blogging, “students are compelled to focus more on the world around them.” The need to satisfy audience interest thus inspires students to become more resourceful and dedicate themselves to their passions (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “will enable students to deepen their analytical and critical thinking; through actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others’ writings as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming “bilingual” capital city of Canada, offering visitors a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase its past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lie the pristine natural beauties of the Muskoka region.
All of these and other things highlight Ontario as what foreigners consider quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas higher up in the north are rather sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of populations that will surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have ties with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and it was widely embraced in the Comoros and on the island of Mayotte.
The period of European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female travelers are advised to claim they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (but only one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would normally consider harassment. It’s not uncommon to be stared at, have your shoulder touched, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don’t be afraid to hold your ground (cultural differences or not, it’s not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and, under the name Anfa, served as a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Bayda, and Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive cities for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of knick-knacks, but all of it is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
Even though Goma is reasonably safe, you should do your research before traveling outside of Goma to understand the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
To get around the city of Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorbike taxi). A typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor to denote relatively inaccessible, exotic, and distant lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction. There is also an airport located there.
In 1990, the city was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates during the PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as its appearance is more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) in northeastern South Africa stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is formed by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Here, too, a daily park maintenance fee and entrance fees are charged, just as they are in all South African national parks.
The most beneficial option may be to purchase a Wild Card ticket, which allows entry to either a selected number of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
According to the island of Hong Kong, the entire area of Hong Kong is called and is a place that is a major focal point for many tourists.
The collection of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong could be likened to a glowing bar chart, visible from Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the most beautiful view of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head across to the Kowloon shoreline.
The vast majority of urban development in Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place that British colonizers appropriated, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, it's a good place to start.
Sundarban is the world’s largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is designated as Sundarban National Park.
Forests aren’t limited to mangrove swamps—they also include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans extends over an area of 3,850 km², with approximately one-third covered by water/wetland areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a kingdom of wilderness, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Indian tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
It is recommended to purchase your ticket several days in advance, as long-distance buses are often full.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby towns, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It spans the entire Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two bridges rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is scheduled for September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs checkpoints should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group of people. They inhabited the area of present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "Great Province of the Indies," emerged from the clash between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in the Las Cañitas area.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
You can find information about tournaments and ticket purchasing options for polo matches on the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and through Stanley credit cards, and American dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although they may take British and American currency; verify this in advance with the owners to find out what payment methods are accepted.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency off the islands is almost impossible, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct rainy and dry seasons: rainfall remains roughly consistent throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of people, wildlife remains wild and we should not feed or disturb it.
According to park authorities, you must remain at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how peaceful they appear, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so you need to give them space.
You should also be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of an infamous naval misunderstanding in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships, except for one British cruiser, were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering of people in the town led to the killing of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The enclosure by two harbours in Auckland allows for the existence of many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches in North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
It’s about occasionally crowded beaches for families with plenty of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One, it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called Manta.
Many French wines are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be more accessible.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink. However, if you have any concerns, getting bottled water is not a problem.
For Australians, the concept of a “flat white” coffee is foreign. A small black coffee is “espresso”, cappuccino is served with a thick layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the cliff, and injuries resulting from any of these causes on the cliff are rare.
Despite this, follow the instructions of the relevant authorities, heed the commands of signs, and pay increased attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770. They occasionally appear outside of this period as well.
Sharks really do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't primarily live in the ocean; their typical habitat is the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the certainty that upon arrival at their destination, they will have somewhere to sleep.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with specific hotels. However, they also offer the possibility of booking other forms of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport/from-airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need more time to consider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g., visas).
Any suggestions for changes or requests should be directed to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even when the music performances on the main stages end, music may still be playing in some parts of the festival late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are travelling through the northern Baltic region in winter, check the location of the cabin, as walking on the ice causes quite disturbing noise for those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include a stay in the city. Passengers on a circular cruise are exempt from visa requirements (but please check the conditions).
Casinos usually try very hard to make their guests spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible. They mostly lack windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have unique offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests entertained and staying as long as possible.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered. Since intoxication impairs judgment, all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you therefore cannot drive as you would on clear asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you could get stuck in it.
Reduced visibility can be caused by falling or blowing snow, condensation on the window, or ice forming on the vehicle's window.
In contrast, many countries experience ice and snow regularly, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a great experience for many visitors.
The term "safari" is commonly used to denote overland travel with the aim of viewing magnificent African wildlife, particularly on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and the standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are better viewed from a distance with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, hiking safari, or simply a walk) is a hike lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, having hosted them in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may have found yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most cancellation policies originating from the coronavirus did not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a regular ticket costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps to dry damp clothes. Even if they are not in the room, many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow.
If an iron isn't available, or if you dislike ironing socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful that the fabric isn't too hot (it could cause it to shrink, and even burn in extreme cases).
There are various ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for just one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying bottled water from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may come into contact with animal pests that are not found in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or violently kill people do not usually qualify as pests.
Shopping in so-called duty-free zones allows you to acquire goods exempt from standard and consumption taxes.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes may sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the stretch with the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it frequently passes through isolated, forested terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on dirt roads, be careful: they are full of steep slopes, narrow tracks, and sharp bends.
The published speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – typically 56-64 km/h – and strict adherence to them is more important than ever before.
Surprisingly, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than on many other sections of the route, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria also rather diverse and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common. Apples are typically baked into pastries year-round, while cherries and plums usually appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. They are often enjoyed with a cup of strong coffee, especially popular pastries.
If you want a small but filling pastry, try a filled doughnut, which depending on the region is called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
We know curry as “dry” or “wet”, depending on the amount of liquid used.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
If this term is used without further qualification, it tends to refer to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the island, features many simply seasoned dishes. Popular seasonings among Javanese people include peanuts, chili, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They offer the rider greater stability, but can also pose a safety risk as the rider's legs could potentially get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse bolts. A number of safety precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a fairly narrow, smooth sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English ones, are equipped with safety bars that allow the stirrup to detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley is a popular rock climbing destination in Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America due to its diverse, massive granite walls and rock overhangs.
The views from the mountaintops are breathtaking. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly discovering new routes among the endless potential of the walls.
Popular downhill winter sports like skiing and snowboarding involve gliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski fanatics," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
With a backpack on skis: This activity is also called cross-country skiing with a backpack, ski mountaineering, or ski touring.
It is related to (but doesn't usually include) alpine ski touring and mountaineering, which is practiced on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and bindings.
Consider the ski slope as similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than if you were walking – but you will only rarely achieve speeds comparable to cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent states. Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would mean repeatedly applying for visas and undergoing passport checks.
In this regard, the Schengen Area functions to some extent like one country.
If you remain within this zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for visas to each Schengen Area member country separately, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes an item an antique. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods over 100 years old.
The conditions for establishing this are different worldwide, and this age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be classified as antiques even if they are newer than a similar mass-produced product.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and a culture of trade is also important for many other professions in the region.
Traditionally, however, not all Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but also made a living from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, mostly using reindeer as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people are engaged in modern crafts. In Sápmi, the Sámi region, tourism is an important source of income.
Although the word "cigán" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are planning to visit is subject to travel advice, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
Besides your own government, you may also want to consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The news report provides only a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The stated opinions are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious societal disruption, or loss of life.
Adverse weather and its various types, which depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions, can occur anywhere in the world.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of adverse weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among regional and seasonal adverse weather phenomena are blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
We strongly advise travelers to consider all risks that may arise as a result of adverse weather conditions in their area, which could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should attend a professional training course.
Just search online for “hostile environment awareness training” and you’ll likely get the address of some local company.
The course covers all the problems discussed here in much greater detail, along with practical experience.
The course typically lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid instruction, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are common, but publications addressing war zones are scarce.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid identification for their return journey as well.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to reflect a person’s preferred name and gender varies.
Similarly varied is the willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents.
After September 11, 2001, security checks at checkpoints also became much more bothersome.
Transgender people should not expect to pass through scanners without intrusion into their privacy and dignity before surgery.
Rip currents are a return flow from breaking waves on a beach, often near a cliff or similar structure.
Thanks to the underwater topography, backflow concentrates in several deeper sections, where fast currents and even deep water can form.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which can be completely impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere you won't be recaptured. Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether anyone has registered you, you can try to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock sets in faster than cultural shock (the initial idyllic phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For travelers who easily adapted to a new culture, it is sometimes particularly challenging to readjust to their original culture.
After returning home from a stay abroad, you adapted to a new culture and lost some of your customs from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were likely patient and understanding, because they knew that travelers need to adjust in a new country.
People don't need to anticipate that returning travelers need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
You can view the pyramids in darkness and silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the chatter of tourists and vendors here. The story of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx is presented as a backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
Various scenes are depicted on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, including sixteen that were still active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, these include Livingston and Deception Islands, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano creates a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region located in the southern part of the peninsula and is bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here into a highland plateau and then re-emerge, forming the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is dissected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountains of Antarctica are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range. This is the Vinson Massif, with its highest peak, Mount Vinson, reaching an altitude of 4892 meters above sea level.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone coverage.
Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for mobile phones. To make a call with one, you must be outdoors in a location with a clear view of the satellite.
This service is often used in maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as on expeditions that require data and voice connectivity over long distances.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, travelling and learning remain the most popular choice.
It is particularly popular among recent graduates, as it offers them the opportunity for a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, participating in a foreign access course can genuinely increase your chances of getting into higher education in your country.
Tuition is usually required to register for these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and on the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on archipelagos and lakes.
Even though coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are truly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Canoeing is a Finnish national sport, with one canoe for every seven or eight people.
It's the same for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it's quite unique elsewhere (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is 1 to forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic Sea also offer an extended stay in Russian Saint Petersburg.
This means you have a few full days to visit the historical city, while returning to the boat for the night.
If you are going to the shore only on a day trip by excursion boat, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures include the German city of Berlin. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience, regardless of the age or origin of the passengers. Especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
There’s nothing to be ashamed of: it’s no different from personal fears and aversions to things that many people experience.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help overcome fear that is based on the unknown or on a lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for fast delivery. When it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs, time is often critical.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but with other routes and smaller firms, a problem has arisen.
If the goods were sent by air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take days on some transport routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. However, airline regulations don’t allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, so that’s where you come in.
An obvious way to fly in first or business class is to allocate a large amount of financial resources to this privilege (or ideally, to get your company to do so instead of you).
However, it won’t be cheap: you can expect to pay up to four times the standard fare for business class and up to eleven times as much for first class!
Generally, it's not even worth looking for discounts on business class tickets or first class for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know very well that there is a core group of passengers willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they price their fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very often used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna has transformed into a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center sprawling around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Amidst wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centres, you find houses with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches. The city feels more like a Mediterranean European atmosphere than modern-day Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble statues of doves above some graves.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk around an interesting village.
Within reach to the north lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, well-known among foreigners and made famous by the brilliant poem about its splendors written by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 regularly runs to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
You can also visit a significant shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (tomb) in the north, which is the site of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please keep in mind that you are essentially a visitor to a mass grave, and also a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived some time there, and far more whose close relatives were murdered or worked to death there, of Jewish and non-Jewish origin alike.
Approach this page with the utmost dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage property by writing or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the population prefers to communicate in Catalan, a large majority understands it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs and markings are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
Spanish is not yet commonly used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the subway are announced only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Even though it’s often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to not get lost in Paris is still to behave as well as possible and present yourself as someone “bien élevé” (well-mannered). It will be considerably easier to not get lost.
The reserved exterior of Parisians quickly vanishes if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely covered in forests, primarily beech, spruce, and fir, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts a remarkably diverse range of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, varied soils, and differing altitudes.
This area is also home to a wide variety of animals and birds.
Here, a rare fauna can be found, including the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and black grouse, along with numerous other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide headscarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, a monk or nun might smile at you upon entering.
According to the same regulations, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this outfit from the storage room by the entrance, but you should be aware that the outfit isn't washed after each user, so you probably won't feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Malošská cuisine, like other cuisines in similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (primarily pork) and does not do without olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, or another topping such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns and the personal pronoun Sie (You) always begin with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important distinction to make between verbs and nouns.
It also demonstrably helps simplify reading, but writing is a bit more complicated due to the need to distinguish whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is quite simple, because most words are pronounced the same way they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation differs depending on the following vowel.
Don't forget that 'r' and 'rr' are pronounced differently: *caro* means expensive, and *carro* is a chariot.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar foundation could help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It's true that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish, however, may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to require separate study.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated today and remain used as museums or educational sites.
They are usually found in cities or campuses, as they were built during their time of greatest glory, when light pollution wasn’t yet an issue. They are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were originally organized exclusively for the emperor and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even a single specimen.
If you visit a meticulously maintained garden, collecting “samples” will undoubtedly get you kicked out.
Singapore is generally an exceptionally safe place and it’s very easy to get around. Upon arrival, you can buy almost anything there.
However, if you are located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and also with strong sunlight (with a clear sky, less frequently).
Several buses also run north to Hebron, which is the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you are considering goes to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good idea for choosing a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
In addition, you will also find popular hiking and cycling routes in their vicinity.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by non-believers and non-Christians in Christian countries all over the world.
According to tradition, you stay up all night during Easter to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could easily be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with gatherings frequently celebrated at midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands either swam, flew, or sailed here.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make this journey. As a result, the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced to the territory, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It will be a good opportunity to observe the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost continuously.
And you’ll also be able to enjoy the stars, as light pollution isn’t a problem in sparsely populated areas.
Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what people in the West are accustomed to.
Suits are common work attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is key, with emphasis placed on group effort rather than celebrating individual achievements.
Employees often need to obtain their supervisors' approval before making any decisions and are expected to follow their instructions unconditionally.
