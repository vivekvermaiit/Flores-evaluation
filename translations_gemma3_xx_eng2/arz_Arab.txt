The cocktail, belonging to one of the antibody treatments—which is ZMapp—showed promise from the beginning in this field, but official studies showed that its benefits were less than those hoped for in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, they used the drug ZMapp as a control standard, meaning the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the message of the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute need for the Olympic family to strengthen a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement by the American Olympic Committee that the interests of athletes, clubs, and their sport can be served effectively when we strive for change within our institution, rather than revoking licenses.

The matter doesn’t confirm, but rather suggests that at least some dinosaurs had feathers – it’s a well-known, actual theory – but it also provides details that fossils generally can’t, like color and a three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal’s feathers were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored underneath.
The discovery allows us to have a deep understanding of the topic of feather growth in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers didn’t have a long, large chain called a spine, but they did have other characteristics within the feathers, like protrusions and thorns, but researchers found that the spine was most likely something that happened as a result of further evolution of those other characteristics.
The structure of the wings shows they weren’t used for flying, but for regulating body temperature or display. And the researchers say that although this dinosaur is small, the sample shows the feathers were large, not small.
Researchers said that although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of a fully grown bird, not chick feathers.

But the work that’s mostly finished is theoretical; however, the program was written to simulate the observations that were recorded of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by tidal forces existing between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just like the moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way galaxy also attracts the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have figured out that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way it affects normal matter.
This theory explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy exists surrounding it, resembling a halo, and is made up of tiny particles in huge numbers.

In France, voting has traditionally been an experience of limited technology: voters would isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper showing the candidate they like into an envelope.
After the officials check the voter’s card, the voter puts the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law outlines the procedures in a very strict and precise manner.
Since 1988, it has been necessary for ballot boxes to be transparent so that voters and observers can ensure there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting, and that no envelopes are added except for those of registered voters who are authorized accordingly.
The candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. And at night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and following specific procedures.

That didn't make sense to me; and it definitely wasn't fair.
All I’m going to tell people is that you treat us the way we treat you.
The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, proposed a bill prohibiting the sale or rental of video games with violent content to minors, and he also signed it into law.
The bill requires a label reading "18" to be placed on violent video games sold in the state of California, and imposes a $1000 fine for each offense and on anyone who sells them to a minor.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, issued a statement this morning announcing the trial of Hohne and Pryce.
He has resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by parliament member Eyd Davies. It is expected that parliament member Norman Lamb will take over the position of Minister of Business that Davies is leaving.
A meeting will bring Howen and Bryce to Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
Among the losses were Nicholas Alden, who was twenty-five years old, and Zachary Kodibak, who was twenty-one years old; Kodibak worked as a driver.
Edgar Figuerola sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, but Christopher Schneider needed reconstructive surgery to his face.
Schneider suffers from persistent pain, blindness in one eye, and lost a portion of his skull—his face was reconstructed with titanium—all of this happened while Oka's weapon was aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider gave his testimony via a video link from an American air force base located in his country.
Karbanido entered two individual races in the championship because of the issue we discussed on Wednesday.
The first race I participated in was a slalom, but I didn't finish the race from the first round. I got 36th place out of 116 competitors vying for the same result in that race.
In the second race, which was the giant slalom, I came tenth in the women’s sitting class after a time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Lösch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
In the women's race, four competitors didn't finish, and 45 out of 117 competitors didn't register points in the giant slalom race.
The police in Madia Pradesh returned the stolen computer and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, “We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop.”
The names of the accused are Baba Kangar, Botha Kangar, Rambro Kangar, Ghaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
The police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants stood in front of the court with covers on their faces.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
But the driver sustained serious injuries to his head.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT.
He initially went into the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
And then he went to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that moment on, they accused Adekoya of murdering her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is being held in reserve, awaiting formal charges and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be fabricated due to the widespread dissemination of her photo.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have considered publishing the photos to be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said that “It’s clear to me that journalists are heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or something similar concerning suspects.”
The public prosecutor’s office stated to journalists that it will not comment further, at least until charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document indicates a dispute over borders, with Palestine wanting them based on the borders that existed before the war that occurred in the Middle East in 1967.
The other topics that are said to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is an important issue for both peoples, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting the continuation of a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years, as soon as an agreement is expected, but the Palestinian Authority agrees to this presence continuing for only five years.
The guards needed to closely monitor the released individuals during the supplementary pest control experiment, and the experiment was being conducted while evaluating its effectiveness.
In a partnership established between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Australian Sports Shooters Association, they identified qualified volunteers within the Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Deputy Director of Parks and Heritage Protection at NPWS, the four hunters they chose for the first hunt received intensive training on safety guidelines and procedures.
Martili submitted his resignation yesterday from a new temporary electoral council with nine members.
This is the fifth temporary electoral council for Martelli in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the temporary electoral council, and this was part of a set of measures to organize new elections in the country.
The committee was essentially a hammer blow response to the large protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, emerged due to the failure to hold the elections that were scheduled to take place since 2011.
I’m reporting about around 60 malfunctions and overheating issues with an iPod device, and this caused approximately six fires and injured four people, but their burns were minor.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the company "Meity" announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional incidents that caused overheating, which the company described as "not critical."
The ministry responded to Apple’s request to postpone the report as “a real shame.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The office of emergency management in North Mariana said there was no damage in the country.
One of the people working at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there are no indications that a tsunami might occur.
A police officer, while working for the government, dared to kidnap tourists arriving from Hong Kong as hostages after he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire from his M16 rifle on the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six have died so far.
Six Reuters journalists were released early, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom, and then they shot Mendoza.
He grew up to be like his father, and medicine became his profession.
He trained to become an obstetrician and worked at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Legin began investigating premature births in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that taking the hormone might make the fetus's lungs grow quickly.
Xinhua said that government investigators recovered flight recorders, or what is known as the black box, on Wednesday.
The wrestling colleagues praised Luna Berda.
Tomy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna, passed away on the night of the two moons. A strong woman, unmatched."
Dustin "Golddust" Ranzales said: "Luna was strange like me... and maybe even stranger than I am... I love her and I will miss her... I have hope that she’s in a better place."
Among 1,400 people who were in the poll before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by eight percent from 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of those in the survey agree with this viewpoint, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the latest poll results that came to our attention, 29% saw that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% saw that Australia absolutely shouldn't become a republic at all.
The fitness of the athlete who won the Olympic gold medal is now in doubt due to his complaining, as he was scheduled to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He can’t take the medication he needs to overcome his pain because it’s prohibited in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, succeeded in discovering the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
A few people verified the discovery and used various devices and programs starting in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are considered a source for delivering water to Earth, along with the organic materials that could form proteins and make life possible.
Scientists have hope to understand how planets are formed, and specifically how Earth was formed since the collision of comets with Earth a long time ago.
Komo, who is 53 years old, began his rule at the beginning of this year and signed a law last month allowing same-sex marriage.
And he said that these rumors are just “trivial, political, and ridiculous things.”
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The next generation system, which the Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses a method that connects to satellites, unlike the old method which used ground radar to help air traffic controllers accurately pinpoint the location of planes and provide pilots with very specific information.
There won’t be any extra transportation, local public transport trains won’t stop at Wembley, and there won’t be parking or facilities for the gardens or for getting around inside the stadium.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors without fans.
There’s a study published on Thursday in the Science magazine saying that a new species of bird has emerged in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden said that the evolution of new species continued for just two generations, even though they initially thought this process would take a very long time due to interbreeding between Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, the cactus finch, and the single-billed ground finch.
Gold can be manufactured in all possible shapes, and it can be deformed into small forms.
And you can draw it into a thin wire that you can wrap and twist, and also you can hammer it or roll it into sheets.
We could make it very thin and adhere it to another metal. And it could be so thin that it was used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called “illuminated manuscripts.”
We call this the pH level of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical substance they want to test.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (this is because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Gently mix the dry powders together, then squeeze them with a clean, wet hand to form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and that gives you a strange feeling – it’s like a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with a flushing mechanism in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in homes in the cities of Minos in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets at certain times were part of public baths because men and women would go there together in a mixed-gender setting.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you’re using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
The task requires a huge rocket over 100 feet long to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the shape of the world in an unbelievable way, but providing an easier and faster means of transportation is the most important thing it contributed for our sake.
We have trains, buses, and many other types of transportation.
Among them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
At the end of the matter/issue, there are small cats (including stray domestic cats) eating small prey whose numbers are higher, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The reason for their success was the concept of status – a specific role for each cat to prevent it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
The lion family consists of one to three adult males, and alongside them there are thirty females and cubs.
Usually, the females are close to each other because they are essentially a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like packs of hyenas or dogs, and their behavior is very similar to that of lions (but not the other big cats), and they are also very deadly to their prey.
Because he is an exceptional athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not well), swim and jump long distances, and can pull with a force five times that of a human.
The leopard stays within the same group (the cat family) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. And those four are the only ones that can produce a roaring sound.
The tiger's roar isn't like the lion's full, complete roar, but it's closer to being like a shout with angry words.
Dwarf leopard cats love to eat small animals, and they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can manage to do so. Almost all the animals that a dwarf leopard cat hunts are smaller than it in size.
Scientists believe that fennec foxes track and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell; and they also smell where they are located in the ground.
You can see well in the dark using night vision, and it also moves stealthily. Also, dwarf leopard cats hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main group they came from (for example, when they migrate across a mountain range or river, or move to a new island where they can't easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they previously knew.
Because this new environment has different resources and competitors, this newly formed group will need different characteristics or ways to adapt in order to become a stronger competitor compared to the strength it needed before.
There hasn't been any change to the indigenous population at all; they still need the same adaptation methods as we know them for.
Over time, as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarity to the other residents gradually decreases.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will be so different that we won't consider them the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale (that is, from our breath).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we make clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the dominant predator in its time, so it didn't fear anything except other Mosasaurs.
Her long jaws were fixed with more than 70 teeth like blades, and another set in the roof of her mouth, and that means there’s no stopping anything that gets in her way.
We don’t know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he might have been a carnivore.
It attacked everything that goes into the water again; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't stand against it.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual festive dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
There was also something different, which was that the needy and the women used to eat their food while sitting on chairs, while the wealthy liked to have banquets and eat reclining on their sides.
It wasn't possible for ancient Roman meals to include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and the ancient Romans didn't eat turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of the gods, and it was considered the god’s house.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to fulfill the gods’ needs during festivals and celebrations.
There’s an open courtyard in every temple, inside which is a secluded, safe chamber that only the priests enter.
At times, they used to build distinctive towers shaped like pyramids called ziggurats to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a safe place for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house has no importance.
Most of the Hebrew family’s life was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were simply open tables facing the street. Stone was used in building the houses.
There weren't big forests in the land of Canaan, that’s why wood was expensive.
People settled in Greenland sparsely. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on charges of murder, and when he travelled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even without knowing about its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living in these areas.
Despite the fact that each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched National Treasure, you might feel like a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the paper, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has the phrase “Original Declaration of Independence in four July 1776” written on its back. And the text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although the author of this section of the text is unknown, we know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was originally stored folded.
Therefore, the symbol might have been added simply as a designation.
The landings that took place on that historic day, and the battles that followed, led to the liberation of northern France, but the south hadn’t been liberated yet.
It was under the rule of the French "Vichy" regime. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture that a large group of people share, who live and work together – meaning a society.
The origin of the word "civilization" is the Latin word "civilis," which means "civic," and is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city or city-state." This, in turn, defines it in terms of a societal mass.
The country – the city is the first step in building nations. Civilizational culture, in its essence, is the transfer of knowledge from one generation to the next and a cultural imprint that is preferred and distributed fairly.
Minor cultures often end without leaving any concrete historical evidence and aren't recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the time of the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, with Congress being its only component and possessing the articles of the federal system.
Congress had no authority to enforce taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial power, they relied on state authorities which were, for the most part, not cooperative at all to enforce all of its laws.
She didn’t even have the authority to override the tax and customs laws between the states.
The required materials stipulated unanimous approval from all states before any amendments, and the states mocked the central government to the point that their representatives were largely absent.
The Italian football team, and also the German football team, are the second most successful teams in the world, and they were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), and that makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Because of the cluster/system of islands that exist in Japan, they used to geographically refer to Japan as an “archipelago”.
Taiwan began its return to prominence in the fifteenth century when European sailors passing by it wrote the name Formosa, or the Beautiful Island, for the island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to alter the original grain production practices and employ Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar farms.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, and after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu city has three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been restored, and restoration work is still ongoing today.
For example, the most widely used format for capturing still images worldwide is 35mm, which was the most popular film format at the end of the analog film era.
Production is still ongoing to this day, but more importantly, the image sensor aspect ratio in digital cameras inherited the proportion of image width to height.
The 35mm format is, in reality, a bit confusing, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this image is (either divide by 12 to get the ratio in its simplest whole number form) therefore it will be 3:2.
It either equals or closely resembles many common formats (like a set of advanced image system formulas) this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which they misuse and often mock, actually represents a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in a clear form.
The most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (as shown in the example).
The Catholic Church, which became wealthy and powerful, was under the scrutiny of investigative authorities during this period of European history.
Christianity linked the European countries together for more than a thousand years, despite their differences in language and customs.
The comprehensive power he possessed had an impact on everyone, from the king to the common people.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that funds held by the church exist specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the Church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this focus on power and money has led many people to question whether this doctrine is achieving its goals.
Britain hastened to impose a naval blockade on Germany after skirmishes and confrontations emerged.
The strategy proved effective; it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law as generally accepted and codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering vast areas of the oceans, and this act threatens even neutral ships.
Because there was limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its own policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, peace and isolation were the attitude most citizens and nations preferred.
After seeing the disasters brought about by World War I, the country wanted to avoid a repeat of it happening again later.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to work with Edison's company in New York City.
He came to America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method, and praise be to God, they refer to specific periods in history; they refer to each period of China or each dynasty that was in power as a different type.
There was a period of cold and instability with the division of provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the First Intermediate Period, which lasted 60 years between the Sixth Dynasty and the Eleventh Dynasty.
During these times, a strong war broke out between many nobles who wanted to reach the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died fighting for the highest positions in the grand palace in Xian.
The social and political impacts are numerous, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolute rule to a republic, nationalism, and the conviction that the state belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Even after the revolution, jobs were mostly given to well-connected young men, and this was an opportunity for anyone with more ambition to get ahead.
The same thing happened in the army, because instead of army ranks being based on class, now they depend on caliber [of weapons/influence].
The French Revolution also impacted many oppressed working-class people in other countries, inspiring them to start their own revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, was very interested in things that go beyond this worldly life. He got used to going to a cave, known as Hira, above Mount Noor, to contemplate.
The cave that the Prophet entered and that has remained present in every era presents itself as a very vivid image of the Prophet Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it’s never easy to find him even if you know he’s there. Because as soon as he enters the cave, he becomes completely isolated.
There’s nothing you can see except the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. And you can only see or hear very little of what’s inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza Governorate is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the pharaohs in the third century BC, is a large pyramidal structure they constructed to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," located in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains some pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
The "upward string" sign looks like the letter V, and the "downward string" sign looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
An upper mark indicates that we should start from the tip and push the bow, while a lower mark means we must start from the end of the bow (where your hand holds it) and pull it.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and a bit sharper.
Don't hesitate to mark your parts with a pencil, but remember that the printed curved markings are there for a musical reason, so you must take them into account.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their young children (Marie Thérèse, who was 11, and Louis Charles, who was 4), and the King’s sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a group of market women rioters.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by many people who were shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A group of fans managed to force the king and queen to open their car windows all the way.
One of the gang members at a certain time signaled with his head to one of the royal guards who was killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the price for the American imperialist war in its invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Naturally, the large profits coming from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are what will constitute the primary gains of American imperialism.
We need to understand the context that led to the organization’s creation, in order to grasp the Knights Templar.
The era in which all these events took place was the High Middle Ages, which corresponds to the period in European history from the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, all of which end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas, ranging from technological dynamism or technological necessity to the strict viewpoint that the fate of humanity is determined by a fundamental logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the evolution of technology itself follows a course largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has an “impact” on the culture of society that is inherent and socially unconditional.
For example, someone might say that a car engine leads to the development of bridges.
Building a road network across the country isn’t economically beneficial just for a few cars, so they’re developing new roads to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also leads to an increase in the rate of road accidents, and this causes the invention of new methods in healthcare to treat bodies that have been exposed to damage.
Romanticism was based on a large element of cultural determinism, drawing from authors like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
With the rise of the Romantic movement, geography was shaping individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to this geography emerged. These people, because they were in harmony with the place and society, were better off than those subjected to imposed laws.
Paris is famous for being the fashion capital of the world now, but Constantinople was the fashion capital of Europe during the feudal era.
Its fame is that it was a center of luxury, starting in 400 AD and lasting until 1100 AD.
Her condition deteriorated during the twelfth century primarily because the Crusades returned with gifts like silk and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
But at that time, Paris became the fashion capital instead of Constantinople.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th or 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Despite that, and due to the slowness of communication channels, the situation in the West could lag behind by about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, due to the Crusades, was people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the type of agriculture whose goal is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family only.
Subsistence farming – which is often organic – is a simple system where they use seeds saved from previous harvests that are suited to the local ecosystem, alongside crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to improve yields.
Most farmers have worked in agriculture before for subsistence purposes, and this situation continues in many developing countries.
Subcultures work to reconcile individuals with similar thinking and those who feel neglected by societal standards, and these standards allow them to develop an identity for themselves.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to age, race, class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures signal their affiliation through their use of a style that includes clothing, adornment, and jargon in a symbolic and distinctive way.
Among the common approaches used to illustrate the significant role socialization plays, is focusing on the unfortunate few cases of children who suffered—through neglect, bad luck, or intentional harm—and were socially disconnected from adults during their upbringing.
These children are often called "the feral ones" or "the wild ones." Some lost children have been held captive by people (usually their parents); in some cases, parents would abandon the child due to their refusal to accept the child’s severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced mistreatment during childhood, or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
There are doubts that other animals raised them, and some people say that some lived in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child displays behaviors (within physical limitations) that strongly resemble those of the animal caregiver, such as fear of humans or indifference towards them.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more engaging, the support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning isn’t a learning method in itself, but rather a supporting tool that provides assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, like using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and in-person, and in another way, the teacher is considered a form of interactive learning, and also the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Internal learning within the program is supported internally, and its goal is to raise questions, encourage participation, and explain procedures that might be difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in state care because they face things like neglect, harm, and even blackmail.
It's absolutely unacceptable for any child to grow up in an environment that doesn’t prioritize upbringing, care, and education, but that’s what they’re doing.
We know that the alternative care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and dependable healthcare.
Alternative care must provide all the necessary things they lost in the homes they previously left.
The internet combines elements of mass and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions regarding the concept of "uses and benefits."
For example, some people say that learning and socialization are key drivers for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and ongoing relationships were identified as new motivational aspects by Im and McCord (1998) when they studied public reaction to websites.
Using these video recordings led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions, which are movements of the face that last for only a few fractions of a second.
It’s specifically said that one can discover if a person is lying or not by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks said in his paper that the President’s speech states that people who can’t understand language due to brain damage are able to assess sincerity with great credibility.
He's proposing the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals, like pet dogs.
Research in the twentieth century clarified the existence of two groups of genetic variations: one hidden and the other apparent.
The mutation adds new genetic diversity, but selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
The splitting and re-assembly operations introduce random drift back and forth between the groups with each generation.
In the savanna, major mammals with digestive systems similar to those of humans struggle to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
If you continue to work like this, it will lead to serious consequences such as stunted growth and malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant resources that were easily accessible to us are the proteins we can get from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if they aren’t cooked.
On the other hand, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) isn’t just easy to digest, but it also provides a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
When we put everything in our heads, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Sleep interruption is waking up intentionally during your sleep period, after a short time of falling asleep (from 10 to 60 minutes).
It’s possible to do this easily by using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you back to awareness without waking you up from your sleep.
If you find yourself resetting the clock again while asleep, it might be placed on the opposite side of the room, and that forces you to get out of bed to stop it.
Options based on the circadian rhythm include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less stress there is, the more positivity increases, which gives you the strength to live. And everyone has the hidden ability to enjoy lasting peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach what they want. But the only thing stopping us on our path to our goal is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it extended through the Mahayana path of love and other methods taken from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations, particularly with Kundalini Yoga.
The Tibetan meditation center is basically yoga with God. Through visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness is created for enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and that led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and America, but when the war ended, differences in systems, procedures, and cultures caused the conflict between the two countries to reappear.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed that this war would last for the next forty years, with fighting on the ground, through proxy armies coming from Africa and Asia present in the battlefields of Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
And on September 17th, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridge.
Despite all that, these plans became outdated overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland – and this was a violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport these goods is the most effective way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The navy’s function, traditionally, was to ensure your country’s ability to transport its people and goods, and at the same time, disrupt the enemy’s ability to do the same.
A recent example that needs to be noted is the Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
The German navy was trying to prevent the occupation by using submarines at that time.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to reach Britain just as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used it to easily access milk, hair, meat, and hides.
The domesticated goats used to be raised in herds that roamed the hills and other grazing areas, and were mostly tended to by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, like the famous shepherd. These grazing routes are still used today.
The paving of roads for carriages in England was developed at a time dating back to the 16th century.
Although the old train carriages were simply wooden planks stacked facing each other, horses were given the opportunity to pull them to be fast and also to pull heavy loads, especially when compared to the very rough roads at the time.
The crossbars were initially used to secure the rails in place. But gradually, they realized that if they installed a steel bar above the tracks, it would improve efficiency.
This is a well-known fact, but the iron caused corrosion to the wooden wheels of the carriages.
And finally, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron ones. And in 1767, they introduced the first complete iron rails.
Walking was the first means of transportation, and humans began to walk upright two million years ago, which was around the time *Homo erectus* appeared (meaning 'upright man').
Australopithecus ancestors didn’t walk upright the way we’re used to.
And also, there are species with footprints in Australopithecus excavations from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs from seven million years ago.
We could start living in a way that’s more in harmony with the environment, we could join the environmental movement, and we could even become activists to reduce future suffering to a certain extent.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. And even so, if we don’t want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and get rid of it.
It’s clearly evident that the world has changed a lot due to human scientific and artistic progress, and problems have become bigger because of population increase and people’s luxurious lifestyles.
After Congress was alerted on July 4th that a draft written by hand and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson had been followed to John Dunlap's printing shop, a short distance from some of the buildings.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as “Dunlap’s critical broadsides.”
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in Independence Hall on July eighth.
One of them followed her to George Washington in July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. And a copy of it arrived in London on August 10th.
Dunlop’s twenty-five broadsides represent the oldest remaining copies of the American Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version hasn’t survived.
Many paleontologists today are confident that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
They often don't realize they're dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with protective outer layers and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
All computers currently in use fundamentally rely on processing information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary digit can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits – or bits, if we’re using computer language.
Internal poisoning might not show its symptoms on time. An immediate diagnosis can’t be built solely on symptoms like vomiting, as they are generally insufficient.
The best indicator of poisoning inside the home could be the presence of an open container for medications or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the ticket to find the first aid instructions for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term “bed bugs” in its official sense to refer to these groups of insects.
This term comes from ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have greatly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Deadly remnants and bed bugs share characteristics like the length of their incubation period, and they can also live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Subhan Allah, America alone has around 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease among young people and adults of middle age.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
There's a man and a woman who are doing what *they* want, not what’s in their best interest or the best interest of their young child, to raise a small child.
These couples can choose to develop an adoption plan for their children.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using a scientific approach. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Despite that, she isn't unique in this regard, and experimentation is considered a test that can be used to eliminate one or more potential hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and specifically on the Gospel in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all scientific subjects, even psychology.
When the level of knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior heavily rely, often, on the presence of self-sustained oscillations and their generation by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which aren’t merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living organisms, including those found in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that run in cycles repeatedly, even without external influences.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the crucial pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to determine whether the bacteriophage used DNA labeled with phosphorus-32, or protein labeled with sulfur-35.
Mutations can have a range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells or not.
But mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, photographing, and getting to know the orangutan in Borneo.
People leave the small towns in their cars every morning to get to work, and on the way they encounter other people who work in the place they just left.
In this vibrant mode of transport, everyone relies on and is connected to a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this great carbon-based economy has pushed the atmosphere out of its stable state, and which supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems, yet they all complain about the transportation systems.
It's rare to hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why are the transportation systems causing all these complaints, and why are they failing daily? Are the transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it’s impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% accuracy.
Luckily, drivers usually tend to act rationally; and because of that, traffic flow is balanced, and we can represent it with a very rough approximation.
To better clarify the flow of traffic, there’s now a relationship between the three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and reach food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the feature of being able to fold their wings back along the length of their bodies.
This gives them a larger collection of smaller places to hide from predators.
Today, the single-winged insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many thought the opposite, and that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because you don’t feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It contains more than 8 times the water of the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes its width reaches 6 miles.
20 percent of the water that flows from all the rivers on the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River, glory be to God.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the fact that the pyramids were built with stone and continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed in size and artistic distinction in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians during the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of those who came before them, which lasted for more than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the whole world and the least populated.
Vatican City uses the Italian language for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a language of everyday life used by most people working in the country, but Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
The residents of the Vatican are all of the Roman Catholic faith.
People have known since ancient times that there are essential chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, and that all these elements can be discovered in nature in their original form and extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory stating that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed it transforms into new materials to form what we see.
Ingots are originally a mixture containing two or more metals. And don’t forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also other minerals like silver and gold.
It's also possible to take ingots that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe was created from matter, and all matter was created from small particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, to the point that trillions of them could fit within the size of the dot at the end of this sentence.
Again, the pencil was a good friend because of how many people appeared with it.
Unfortunately, when new writing tools emerged, the pencil’s importance diminished and we no longer use it except in a few cases.
People nowadays can write messages on a computer screen without needing to use a pencil sharpener.
People can’t help but wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle of accumulating energy to create a nucleus packed with protons and neutrons.
It’s like rolling a heavy car uphill. The core inhales again and some of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and that means they tend to decay with a simple movement or without any.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust reaches about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
He is thinner under Maria and thicker under the highlands area.
There could be many lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner there, and it was easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on the idea that people search for what attracts and excites them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that manifest spontaneously once they reach puberty.
These theories deal with the issue of what makes people do what they do, and the things in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories for content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, there are two behaviors that can emerge when managers start leading former peers: one of them is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, determining responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, a person turns into someone you wouldn’t recognize and feels like they need to change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
And after all of that, the leader is the one who takes responsibility for the team’s success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Mostly, virtual team members work like a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
They usually have more independence than members of traditional teams, as their teams may meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
Larsen and Fasto (1989, p109) described the existence of a real covert team as having a unique composition unlike a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team that every member reports to, and it’s responsible for setting the standards for each member.
Why might an organization want to establish an educational organization in a process that takes a long time? Innovation is considered one of the goals of applying institutional learning concepts.
When you effectively utilize all available resources through the functional departments within the organization, creativity and excellence can be achieved.
As a result of this, the cooperation within the organization to overcome difficulties can lead us to a new, innovative process that meets the client’s needs.
Before the organization can be capable of innovation, management must create a culture of innovation and knowledge sharing alongside education for the organization.
Angel (2006) explains a method called continuity and how it’s used to help organizations reach a high level of performance, sir.
Data related to neuroscience provides concrete evidence for the theoretical approach when seeking knowledge. And thus, it works to narrow the search area and make it very accurate.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's well-known for a long time that different types of brain damage – including traumas, lesions, and tumors – affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes in ways we haven’t before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence closely resembles science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The goal of research in artificial intelligence is to make machines perform tasks automatically, and that requires a smart approach.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and also through it you can recognize handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate fields focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now being used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and they were also used to develop a range of software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are considered a big part of any semester. Often, the teacher might like to accompany her students to places they can’t reach by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips, and students can see artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Also, participating in a virtual field trip represents a wonderful way we can use to think about a trip and exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School every year in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but they keep the old versions online as a record.
Blogs can help improve students’ writing. And at the time students often begin their experience with blogs with incorrect grammar and spelling, but having an audience changes all of that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "force students to be smarter with the world around them." There's an incentive to feed public interest and that makes students excel and be beneficial (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that allows people to collaborate and encourages students to continue their education even after the regular school day.
The proper use of blogs makes students more analytical and critical through their active response to online materials, identifying their position regarding the writings of others, and also presenting their own viewpoints regarding specific topics (Oravik, 2002).
Ottawa is the attractive capital of Canada, which has two official languages and features a few art exhibitions and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Niagara Falls is located in the far south, and the north is a place with natural beauty that isn’t exploited, like Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more make Ontario seem like how foreigners see it – originally, sir, it’s Canadian.
Vast areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited.
To illustrate the comparison that surprises many people: the number of African Americans living in America is larger than the population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, opposite the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island, and it’s considered an independent continent – we spoke about the wildlife there.
Most small islands are independent countries or associated with France, and are often known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the land, and it spread widely in the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
The beginning of European influence and colonialism in the fifteenth century was when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama successfully navigated the Cape Route, connecting Europe to India.
From the north, the region borders the African coast, and the Atlantic Ocean borders it from the south and west.
For women: Regardless of their actual marital status, women who are traveling must declare that they are married.
He’s helping her get a ring on her finger (but not one that looks *too* expensive).
Women need to know that cultural differences can lead to harassment and that it’s common to be followed, and grabbed by the arm, etc.
You need to be strong in front of men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (differences in culture or anything else don't make it acceptable!).
The new city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Badia, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it the White House (Dar al-Bayda).
Casablanca isn’t one of the most attractive places for shopping in all of Morocco.
It’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods everywhere in the city, like tagines, pottery, leather items, shisha pipes, and all sorts of cheap things, but it’s all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it’s situated in the far east, close to Rwanda.
The lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma in 2002, covering most of the city’s streets, especially downtown.
Any visits outside of Goma need to be investigated to understand the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu province, while Goma itself is reasonably safe.
The city is a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the most affordable ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can take a *boda boda* (a motorcycle taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
The area of "Timbuktu" is used metaphorically to refer to faraway, exotic lands because it’s difficult to reach.
Timbuktu nowadays is a poor city, despite its reputation which makes it a tourist attraction and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites under threat, due to the threat of desert sands.
One of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates in the PBS series was about the wonders of Africa’s private heritage.
The city has a stark contrast with the rest of the country's cities, as its character is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, extending parallel to the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It’s one of the areas that attracts visitors in South Africa, and is considered one of the best national parks in South Africa.
There are maintenance and entrance fees imposed at the garden, like all public gardens found in South Africa.
It’s beneficial to buy a Wild Card, as it allows you access to a selected group of South African parks or all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name, and it’s a place many tourists consider a major attraction.
The buildings that, like a row you draw to depict the Hong Kong skyline, resemble a glittering graph appearing above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of urban development in Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonists used as their own private space, and because of that, if you’re looking for evidence of the region’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending for 80 km (50 miles) into areas off the coasts of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was announced as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Its name refers to the forested part located in Indian territory within Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests aren’t just mangrove swamps; they also contain the last remnants of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges River.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, approximately one-third of which is water and wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a haven for wildlife, and currently house 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses run from the bus station between the areas (via the river) all day, although most of them, especially those going to the east and Juba/Bomthang, run between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
The buses that travel between neighborhoods are usually very crowded, and it’s best to buy your tickets well in advance, a few days before.
Most areas are served by Coaster buses, which are small Japanese vans and are comfortable and sturdy.
These shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get around to nearby places, like Baro (Nu 150) and Bonakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers is 83 meters, and their length is 378 meters, and they have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The clear vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection points are also completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the area we now know as Eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers while also practicing subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaikuru and Paiagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, which was formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indians," emerged in the 16th century due to the confrontation between Spanish invaders and the indigenous population.
The Spanish began the colonial era that lasted three centuries.
From the moment Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay was able to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous worldwide for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held this year in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Alongside that, you can check out the tournaments and smaller matches here at other times of the year.
If you want to know news about tournaments and where to buy polo match tickets, check out the Argentine Polo Association’s website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British Pound (GBP).
Is it possible to exchange currency at the only bank on the islands in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West shop?
You can use Sterling in every part of the island, and you can also use Stanley credit cards and the US dollar frequently.
In the more remote islands, they might not accept credit cards, but they may accept British and US currency; be sure to check with the owners beforehand to find out the accepted payment methods.
It’s impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you have to exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it will have summer when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical areas, and temperatures often exceed 30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
It's possible the winter is deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
The amount of rainfall remains consistent throughout the year, without distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Even though many of the animals in the zoo are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and shouldn’t be fed or disturbed.
According to the park management, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how harmless it looks, bison, moose, deer, bears, and pretty much all large animals can attack.
Many visitors get injured every year because they don’t keep a safe distance. These animals are large and wild, and can also be dangerous, so you have to give them their space.
Over here, be careful because smells attract bears and other wild animals, so don’t carry or cook smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. And this city is located on Apollo Island and its population is less than 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was a location for naval confrontations, reportedly fierce in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain were refused permission to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British warship, and around 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle of the Maoist movement for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the death of leader Tupou Tamasisi Lulofie III.
Because Auckland is located between two harbors, it has many beaches, the most famous of which are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All the beaches are sandy, allowing for almost safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by bougainvillea trees.
Tamaki beaches are located on the Waimata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches get crowded sometimes, with a good selection of shops lined up along the beach. Swimming is safe.
The basic, popular beer is called "Number One," it’s not a mixed drink, but it’s a fun and refreshing drink. The other local beer is Manta.
French wine has many varieties, but New Zealand and Australian wines might become more widespread.
Tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you’re worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is an "espresso," and a cappuccino has a layer of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent, although they are expensive.
Many trips to the coral reefs are available all year round, and it’s rare for the coral reefs to be damaged for any reason.
Despite that, seek advice from the authorities, and comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770, and you might find them sometimes at other times of the year too.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. And most sharks are afraid of people and swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles don’t usually live in the ocean, but their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing they’ll have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Even though you might find other types of accommodation bookings, like camping through a travel agent, travel agents generally deal with specific hotels.
It’s customary for travel agents to offer packages that include breakfast, and arrangements for transportation to and from the airport, or even comprehensive packages including flights and hotels.
They can hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (like a visa).
Despite that, any modifications or requests are made through the travel agent initially, and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of people attending music festivals decide to camp on-site and consider that an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
You need to remember that the music on the main stages might be finished, but some sections of the festival might continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals include dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea region in winter, you need to check the cabin's location, because travelling through ice causes a lot of noise for people who are very affected by it.
St. Petersburg cruises typically include a specific amount of time spent in the city, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (double-check the conditions though).
Casinos put in a lot of effort to increase the time and money guests spend there. Normally, there aren’t windows or clocks, and it’s also difficult to find exits.
They have a habit of offering special meals, drinks, and entertainment shows, to keep the guests in a good mood and make them stay in the building.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but sugar impairs sound judgment, and all discerning gamblers know the importance of a gambler being conscious.
If you're driving your car at high altitudes or over mountain passes, you need to consider the possibility of snow or ice falling, or that temperatures might be below zero.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is weak and it won’t feel like you’re driving on smooth asphalt.
During snowstorms, a significant amount of snow can fall, and that’s often enough to block roads very quickly.
Snowfall, blowing snow, condensation, or the presence of snow on car windows can all cause limited visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic generally continues to flow without interruption all year round.
Safari trips could be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and more prominent for many visitors.
The term "safari trips" is generally used to refer to traveling across the country to see the wonderful wildlife in Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars and standard equipment that allows for good viewing.
Lions, leopards, and tigers are sometimes shy, and you can see them better using binoculars.
Walking safaris (also known as "a journey on foot", "hiking while walking", or "a stroll") are long-distance walks that can last for hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021, and some of the events will be held at other locations in different parts of Japan.
After hosting the Olympic Games in 1964, Tokyo remained the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice.
If you had booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before they announced the postponement, you might face an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from late March, most cancellation policies due to coronavirus won’t be applied until July 2020, when the date of the Olympic Games is determined.
It is expected that most of the event tickets will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while the cost of regular tickets will be around 7,000 yen.
Iron the wet clothes while they’re drying. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if no one is in the room.
If there isn't an iron available, or if you don’t like wearing ironed socks, you can try using an air dryer if you have one.
Don't let the fabric get too hot (because that could make it shrink or even burn in the worst case).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in other areas you need to boil it for several minutes.
The benefit of filters varies; if you’re worried, you should buy bottled water in tightly sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers might encounter animal pests they are unfamiliar with from their home regions.
Pesticides can spoil food, cause irritation, trigger severe allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people severely are not usually described as plagues.
Shopping in the duty-free market is an opportunity to buy goods without taxes, and the fees are limited to specific locations only.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can often save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont remains the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it regularly passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on rural roads, you need to be careful, because there are always slopes, narrow passages, and really sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than they were in previous and subsequent sections—typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h)—and adhering to them is significantly more important than not doing so.
But the mobile phone service is much stronger here than the service in other parts of the road, like the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they have many diverse benefits, like the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruitcake is well-known, apples are baked into it all year round, and cherries and plums appear in it during the summer.
Many German baked goods are made with almonds and hazelnuts, and other types of nuts. They often eat popular cakes with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small and rich pastries, try the ones called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry dish is a dish that contains herbs, spices, meat, and vegetables.
The spice mix for curry can be “dry” or sometimes “wet” depending on the liquid present.
In the inland areas of North India and Pakistan, they usually use a lot of yogurt with curry, while in South India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, they usually use coconut milk.
This Indonesian food is essentially a broad term encompassing a large collection of regional cuisines spread throughout Indonesia, due to the fact that Indonesia has 17,000 islands which makes differentiating between them difficult.
But if we use it without other terms, the term tends to mean that the food originates from the central and eastern regions of the large island of Java.
Currently found extensively throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of dishes seasoned simply, and the popular flavors favored by Javanese people are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They offer a lot of stability for the rider, but can potentially cause safety concerns because the rider's leg might get caught in them.
If the horseman fell off the horse, his foot would still be stuck in the stirrup, and the horse might run away dragging him. There are some safety precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
Initially, the vast majority of horse riders used to wear riding boots that had a heel and very soft, narrow soles.
The other thing is, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the horsehair/padding of the seat to fall from the saddle as soon as you pull it back, as soon as the rider dismounts.
Wadi Kushamo is the first place that comes to mind when we talk about climbing in Chile, and it’s known as the Yosemite of South America, with many walls and large granite rocks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from above. Climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes between the many walls that have endless possibilities.
Snow sports on slopes, like skiing and sledding, are popular sports such as sliding on snow-covered ground with sleds or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is considered a major activity during travel, and there are many enthusiasts for it, sometimes called “ski bums” who plan entire vacations dedicated solely to skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is really old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The history of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Defining snowshoeing: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, snowshoeing trips, or long-distance snow hiking.
This is related to ski touring or mountaineering in the Alps, but it doesn’t usually include cross-country skiing or ice climbing, because those require steep and uneven terrain and need hard skis and tall boots.
Think of the ice skating trail as a kind of long-distance walking path.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to cover longer distances than walking, but you’ll rarely reach the speeds of long-distance skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared trails.
Europe is a small continent, but it has a lot of independent countries. And under normal circumstances, when you travel and pass through many countries, that means you have to apply for visas and have your passport checked multiple times.
Despite that, the Schengen Area functions to some extent as a single country in this regard.
Since you're in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
And the good thing about it is, once you have a Schengen visa, you won’t need to apply for entry visas to each Schengen member state individually, and that’s why it saves time, money, and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define antiques as goods over 100 years old, but there's no comprehensive definition for what we consider antiques among manufactured items.
To explain geographical differences, for example, the maximum age limit is shorter in places like North America than it is in Europe.
Handicrafts can be recognized as antiques even though they are newer than similar goods that were made a long time ago.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important because of many other professions it supports.
Despite the traditions, not every Sami tribe participated significantly in reindeer herding, but they lived off fishing and hunting, and mostly used reindeer as animals to pull things with.
Many Sami people now work in modern crafts, and tourism is considered an important income source in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Despite the widespread use of the word "ghajar" specifically among non-Roma people, it is considered an offensive term because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If the country you’re visiting requires travel advice, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will always be tailored to their citizens.
So, for example, American citizens who are in the Middle East might face completely different situations than those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is a concise summary of the political situation in a country.
Generally, the opinions that are presented tend to be quick, general, and simplified when compared to the wealth of detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the term used to describe any dangerous climatic phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or deaths and people dying.
Bad weather can happen anywhere in the world, and it comes in different forms depending on geography, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, cold temperatures, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes.
Severe regional and seasonal climatic phenomena: includes things like storms with snow, ice, and dust.
Travelers are strongly advised to familiarize themselves with all the risks associated with bad weather in the places they visit, as this can significantly impact their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should get professional training.
Searching for "hostile environment cycle" online could lead you to the address of a local company.
There’s a course that usually covers all the issues we discussed here in more detail, and it’s often with practical training.
As far as I recall, the course duration is between two to five days, and it includes roles and first aid, and sometimes weapons training is involved.
Books and magazines about how to survive in the wilderness are very common, but the number of publications talking about war zones is very few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documentation for their return journey.
Governments are preparing to issue passports without mentioning gender (X), or to issue updated documents to suit a desired name or gender identity that differs.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect documents varies greatly.
Security checkpoint inspections have increasingly involved violations of privacy, especially after September 11th, 2001.
Transgender individuals before surgery should not expect to pass through scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are a flow that comes back from the waves breaking on the shore, usually near coral reefs or something like that.
Because of the topography under the water, the backflow concentrates from places like Goyta, and fast currents can form for the deep water there.
Most deaths happen because of exhaustion while you’re trying to swim against the current, and that might be impossible.
As long as you swim against the current, swimming and returning won't be harder than usual.
Try to point to a safe spot and don't get stuck again, and that depends on your skills and if anyone notices you, you might have to wait for rescue to come.
The shock of returning to the homeland happens faster than culture shock (shortening the honeymoon phase), and it lasts a long time, and its intensity can be greater.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes face particular difficulty readapting to their original culture.
When you return to the homeland after living abroad, you will have adjusted to the new culture and lost some of the customs from your homeland’s culture.
When I first travelled abroad, people tended to be patient and understanding, keeping in mind that travellers in a new country need to adapt to the situation.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are still necessary for travelers returning to their countries.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most enjoyable things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in peace before the show starts.
You can always hear the voices of tourists and vendors here normally. The sound and light show is like the story of a book.
The Sphinx has been designated as a background and a witness to a long history.
The shows are projected onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Many countries are claiming the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819 and have most of the bases, including sixteen that were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers away from the north of the peninsula, but the largest archipelago is found on King George Island, which has a settlement called Villa Las Estrellas.
And among the other places is Livingston Island, and Deception Island, which offers a stunning natural harbor – a submerged caldera of a still-active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula, and is surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the Sinai Peninsula here on the plateau merge, and then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains, which extend for 360 km, and are divided by the Minnesota Glacier river.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, and its peak is approximately 4892 meters, Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where there’s no mobile network coverage, a satellite phone might be the only option.
Satellite phones won’t be a replacement for mobile phones, because you have to stand outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to be able to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used via shipping, including pleasure boats, and also by exploratory missions that have needs for remote data and audio.
There needs to be a local phone service provider available who can provide a lot of information about how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning is always an option for people who are planning a gap year.
This thing is very popular among people who left school, because it allows them to spend a year before joining university, without negatively impacting their education.
Often, enrolling in a year-long training course abroad can improve your chances of getting into higher education in your home country when you return.
Usually, there are fees for registering in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful place if you want to go boating. It also has “the Land of a Thousand Lakes” as well as thousands of islands in the lakes and the coastal archipelago.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelago and lakes.
Despite the fact that coastal archipelagos and lakes are often so large they can swallow any yacht, small boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, to the point where there’s a boat for every seven or eight people.
He meets Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise he’s unique and special (like the Netherlands, the number from one to forty).
Most high-end Baltic cruises include the benefit of permanent residency in Saint Petersburg, Prussia.
This means you can spend several full days visiting the historic city and then return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you’re only taking coastal exploration trips on ships, you won’t need a separate visa (starting from 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature the German city of Berlin; as you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and the cruise price doesn't include a visit to the city.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven’t traveled before or have been through a traumatic incident.
It's not something to be ashamed of: because it's not very different from personal fears and other disliked things that many people have.
Understanding how an airplane works or what happens during a flight can help some people overcome their fear of the unknown or feeling of lack of control.
Shipping companies charge good money to deliver things quickly, and time is usually very important for work documents, goods, and spare parts that need urgent repair.
The biggest companies own their own planes, on some airlines, but there was a problem for the other airlines and smaller companies.
If you ship the goods by air freight, it’s possible that unloading and customs clearance could take days on some routes.
Sending the packages like luggage for inspection was the only way to receive them quickly, but internal regulations don’t allow airlines to send luggage without a passenger, that’s why your turn comes in this stage.
The best way to travel in first or business class is to pay a lot of money to get this perk (or even better, to have your job pay for it).
Despite that, this doesn't come cheap: like strict rules of thumb, you can expect to pay around four times the usual economy fare for businesses, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there’s no point in looking for low prices on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know very well that there’s a specific group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money to get there quickly and comfortably, and they count on that.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. And the local language is Romanian, but Russian is still widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
This conflict in 1994 led to the establishment of the self-declared Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion practiced in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of 3.7 million, and it has the second largest port after Istanbul, and it is also a distinguished transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna was once located around a large bay surrounded by mountains, and it is now a bustling, modern, and developed commercial center.
The wide streets, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers with traditional red-tiled roofs, along with the 18th-century market, mosques, and old churches—despite the city having a more Mediterranean European feel when compared to traditional Turkey.
Haldarsvik village offers views of the nearby Österøy island and features a unique church with an octagonal design.
In the courtyard of the church, there are statues made of marble, amusingly viewed from the pigeons above some of the tombs.
The matter is worth half an hour to wander around the village that sparks our interest.
The romantic city of Centra, with its great beauty, is located to the north in an easily accessible place, and it’s the city that became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron’s captivating account of its wonders.
Bus Scotturb 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and also stops in Cabo da Roca.
To the north, there is also the great shrine of Sayyida Fatima (the tomb), which is a place of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please don’t forget that you are fundamentally at a mass grave site, and this is also a site with a meaning that has no end for a large portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many other people whose loved ones were killed or worked until they died there, both Jews and non-Jews equally.
I wish we would treat the site with all the dignity, respect, and seriousness it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't distort the site by adding marks or writing sentences containing offensive words about homes.
The city of Barcelona officially uses two languages: Catalan and Spanish. Around half the people prefer to speak Catalan, which most people understand, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
Despite that, most signs are expressed in Catalan because, by law, it is the official language of the region.
Despite that, the use of the Spanish language is widespread in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are broadcast in Catalan only, but unexpected disruptions are announced using an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The reputation of the people of Paris is terrible because of selfishness, rudeness, and arrogance.
The ideal way to get by in Paris is to behave politely as a well-mannered person – a "bien élevé" – although often it boils down to falling for a wrong stereotype.
The superficial Parisian airs will evaporate quickly if you offer some basic flattery.
Dense forests contain Plitvice Lakes National Park, whose foundation is beech, spruce, and fir trees, and which is characterized by a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
She has a large and diverse collection of communities with many plants due to the range of local climates, different soil types, and varying altitudes.
The area also has a very diverse selection of animal and bird breeds.
We might find rare animal species there, like the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat, and the hoopoe, alongside many other well-known species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries have headscarves available for women who aren't prepared, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, the monk or nun will smile at you at the entrance.
And like that, they're asking men to wear trousers that cover their entire legs.
This could also have been borrowed from the store near the entrance, but these clothes aren't washed after every use, because then they might not feel comfortable when you wear the skirts. And one size fits all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like other areas of the Mediterranean, relies on bread, vegetables, and meats (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is *bamya* with bread dipped in olive oil and *fuul*, and any available toppings like cheese and tuna, and things like that.
All names, even the word "Sie" for you, must begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
It’s an important way to differentiate between some verbs and nouns.
We could also say that it makes reading easier, even though the writing is a bit complex because we just need to know whether the verb or adjective is being used in a circumstantial form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters we need to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation differs depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, make sure to pronounce the letters “r” and “rr” differently to distinguish between them; for example, “karoo” means precious, but “karro” means a donkey-drawn cart.
The Persian language has relatively easy rules, and is often familiar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar will help you learn a lot about the rules of the Persian language and understand sentences better.
Without telling you, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
Despite that, people who know a little Spanish might realize that Portuguese is very close to it, so you don’t necessarily have to study it on its own.
Observatories that predate the modern era are usually unusable today, and end up as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution at its peak wasn’t like the nature of the problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, making them easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Modern research telescopes are mostly massive facilities located in remote areas with suitable weather conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, called hanami, is a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept originated in China, and plum blossoms were what were famous, and its market is doing better.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom viewing parties for himself and for other people belonging to the noble class around the imperial court.
Plants are at their best when they remain in a natural environment, so you must resist the urge to pick them, even if it's just a single sample.
When you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "samples" will also lead to your rejection without discussion.
Generally, Singapore is considered a very safe place, and it’s easy to get around, to the point where you can buy anything you need after you arrive.
However, due to its location – being “close to the tropics” but just slightly north of the equator – you need to deal with two things: consistently high temperatures and scorching sun (and that’s rare unless the sky is clear).
There are also a few buses heading north to the city of Hebron, which is the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
You need to make sure the bus you’re thinking of goes all the way to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Internal waterways could be a good idea if we want to spend a vacation on them.
For example, visit the castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to fun places on the Danube River or a boat trip on the Erie Canal.
They also designated paths for popular sports like hiking and bike trails.
This Christmas is a well-known holiday among Christians, and people celebrate it as the birth of Christ.
Many holiday customs were adopted by non-religious people in both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There’s a tradition where you spend the entire Passover night until you end up in an open space to watch the sunrise.
It’s certainly possible to interpret this tradition from a Christian theological perspective, but there’s a possibility it was a religious rite for the spring and fertility seasons predating Christianity.
Many traditional churches hold Easter Vigil services on Saturday during Holy Week, and gatherings usually begin celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ when midnight strikes.
All the animals that originally came here to these islands came by swimming, flying, or floating.
And because the distance from the mainland is far, mammals didn't succeed in reaching the islands, and that's what made giant tortoises the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, a large number of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you’ll experience polar night, which means the sun doesn’t rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the aurora, as a large part of the sky will be dark or less bright most of the time.
You can enjoy the stars in the sky because of the low population density of the areas and the lack of light pollution causing a problem.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The uniform is the typical work outfit, and colleagues at work call each other by family name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is very important, as it emphasizes group effort rather than encouraging individual achievements.
Workers are expected to follow their superiors’ instructions without question, and to obey their superiors’ instructions without question.
