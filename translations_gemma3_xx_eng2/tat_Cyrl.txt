Not only does it confirm the widely accepted theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides details, such as color or three-dimensional positioning, that fossils usually cannot.
Scientists say that the scales of this creature are grayish-brown on top and light or carotenoid-colored underneath.
This finding allows us to observe the evolution of feathers in birds as well.
Dinosaurs lack a well-developed sail, called a neural spine, on their backs, but they possess other features of the carapace – barbels and barbules – which researchers believe the neural spine represents a later evolutionary development.
The structure of the horns suggests they weren’t used for fighting, but perhaps for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers believe that even if this horned dinosaur was young, the sample reflects the horns of a mature animal, not those of a baby mammal.
Researchers determined that, even if this tail belonged to a young dinosaur, the specimen reflects the scutes of a mature animal rather than those of a baby mammal.

In France, high technologies are not usually used during voting: voters enter the booth alone, mark their candidates on a pre-printed paper ballot, and place it in an envelope.
After official persons verify the identity of the voter, the voter casts the ballot into the envelope and signs the voting list.

Starting in 1988, polling stations must be highly visible so that voters and observers can see the absence of envelopes at the beginning of voting, and that no envelopes are added except from persons properly authorized and accounted for to vote.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict control based on certain procedures.

In the group where women were sitting, four skiers failed to finish their runs, and 45 out of 117 skiers couldn't secure their places in the slalom-giant.
The Madhya Pradesh police returned stolen items – a personal computer and a mobile phone – to their owners.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused: Baba Kandjar, Bhuta Kandjar, Rampuro Kandjar, Gaza Kandjar and Vishnu Kandjar.
Chandr's Police Superintendent Shekhar Solanki said that the accused were brought to court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the car when it crashed into the house, no one was injured.
The driver sustained serious head injuries.
While rescue services were extracting the driver from the red Audi TT, the road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed.
Initially, they took him to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been held at Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of murdering her own son.
He is under suspicion and awaiting trial, but any witness testimony could be compromised, as his photograph was widely published.
This is the case in other regions of Great Britain, but the Scottish courts operate differently and consider the publication of photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from Dundee University states: “Journalists cross a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects, etc.”
The Crown Prosecution Service, responsible for prosecuting cases of contempt of court, stated that it will be making no further comment until at least an indictment is issued to journalists.
The document, as clarified, concerns the dispute over the desired borders of Palestine before the Six-Day War in 1967.
It is reported that the topics discussed include the status of Jerusalem and the issue of the Jordan Valley, which are sacred to both nations, when translated into another language.
Israel demands the possibility of maintaining military forces in the center for ten years after a ceasefire agreement is signed, while the PA is only willing to agree to this for five years.
Participants in the additional test on controlling short-barreled weapons were to be rigorously inspected by rangers, as the test was conducted under surveillance and its effectiveness was evaluated.
NPWS and the Australian Shooting Sports Association (New South Wales) Inc. jointly recruited qualified volunteers under the Sporting Shooters’ Association of Australia’s hunter training program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director for conservation and heritage at NPWS Parks, the four shooters selected for the first cull operation received clear safety and exercise instructions.
Martelli swore in a new Temporary Election Commission (TEC) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth VSS within four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed the resignation of the former Supreme Court, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
This commission was a response to the widespread protests that began in October against Martelly’s regime.
Sometimes, the inability to hold elections has fueled protests – some dating back to 2011 – that were dispersed with force.
Reports indicate nearly 60 incidents of overheating with faulty iPods, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) reported that it had been informed of 27 incidents related to these defects.
Last week, METI reported that Apple identified another 34 cases of overheating and called them "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's request for an extension "truly regrettable."
The earthquake began in the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reported that no damage was recorded in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami indicator.
Former Philippine police arrest a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several shells were rescued, and at least six are reported to have died at this time.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, will be released first, like Filipino photographers.
Later, as a mature woman needed to go to the toilet, her place was taken by photographers. Mendoza is shot dead.
Liggins deviated from his father's path and began a career in medicine.
She received training as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in his free time, Liggins began researching ways to predict a child’s gender in advance.
His research has shown that administering hormones may accelerate lung maturity in the fetus.
Xinhua government investigators reported on Wednesday that they had found two flight recorders, known as "black boxes."
Fellow wrestlers also expressed respect to the Moon.
Tommy Dreamer: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna left during a two-month period. Quite unique, just like herself. A strong woman," he said.
Dustin "Golden Dust" Rannels said: "The moon was as strange as I am... perhaps even stranger... I love it and I will miss it... I hope it’s in a better place,"
The number of people among 1400 surveyed before the 2010 federal election who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
34 percent of those surveyed agree with this view, expecting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
On opposing sides of the inquiry, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the World Aquatics Championships in 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays, but her form was questioned due to injuries.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to suppress the pain, because they were prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery in early February using various devices and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of bringing organic matter that could have provided the conditions for life, impacting the Earth and creating streams.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, because comets have collided with Earth for a very long time.
The 53-year-old Cuomo, whose governorship began earlier this year, signed a law last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political empty talk and foolishness."
It is believed that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen – according to the FAA, is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes and, saving millions of gallons of fuel, reduce carbon emissions.
Unlike older technology based on ground radar, it utilizes dependent surveillance technology and enables air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of aircraft more accurately, and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport and overland trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no arrangements for dropping off or parking on site.
Concerns about transport shortages increased the likelihood that the game would have to proceed behind closed doors.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species evolved in as little as two generations because of interbreeding between Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*, despite the process being thought to take much longer.
Gold can be processed into any forms. It can be cast into very small shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin strip, woven and braided, dipped in water with a brush, or spread flat and dried.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. It can be made so thin that sometimes, with its help, they decorated illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This chemical substance is called a pH indicator. The indicator can be made with the help of red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H) ions in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Combine two cups of flour and then knead into a ball with clean, damp hands.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, making them interesting in appearance and forming a visible film of their own.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a drain connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bedrafs existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, bedrafs were sometimes part of public feasts where men and women socialized together in mixed company.
When hailing someone miles away, you use an echo.
It receives the faint shimmer of companions in space and almost immediately reflects it back to Earth.
The satellite was launched into space with the help of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and visibility to some extent.
A very large rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a spacecraft or telescope into space.
The wheel has wonderfully changed the world. The greatest thing the wheel has given us is the ability to move much easier and faster.
He gave us a train, a car, and many other means of transport.
Under them are more medium-sized cats, which prey on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray house cats) that prey on a considerable number of small victims such as insects, rodents, moles and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of "own space," allowing each cat to have its own separate task, not competing with others.
Lions live in large groups called prides and are the most social of all cats.
Prides consist of related lions, from one to three males, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Women, generally, maintain close relationships with one another, especially within families of older sisters and daughters.
Lion prides generally behave like packs of wolves or dogs, these predators’ habits are very similar to those of lions (but not like those of other large cats) and they are also very dangerous for their prey.
The tiger – an athlete who has achieved versatile development – climbs (though not very well), swims, jumps long distances, and can pull itself up with five times the strength of a courageous person.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same group (the panther genus). There are no other roaring cats besides these four felines.
The tiger’s growl didn’t resemble the full-mouthed, evil roar of a lion, but rather a sentence composed of dull, screeching words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find animals they can eat (their prey) by their scent on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and also in very stealthy movements. Ocelots hunt by blending their large prey with the surrounding environment, then ambushing the larger ones.
A small group of organisms (a small population) often finds itself in a different environment than the original population it came from – after becoming separated from it (for example, by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by moving to a new island, and therefore making return difficult).
In this new environment, there will be different resources and different competitors, therefore, for a new population to be a strong competitor, it will require different functions or adaptations compared to the previous one.
The previous population generally remains unchanged, they still require the previous adaptations.
As time passes, the new population increasingly adapts to its new environment and becomes less and less like the original population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that they may not even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation. The formation of species is inevitable, and this is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants obtain nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also cast shadows.
We build houses from plants and sew clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the strongest predator of its time, therefore it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
In its long treasury, 70 swords seemed to have passed, and in addition to them, a cluster of extra teeth had grown together on the upper side of the mouth. Therefore, nothing that entered here could escape.
Although it cannot be said with certainty now, it is likely that its tongue was forked. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs. It is also very possible that it was even a cannibal.
He attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex couldn't have overcome him.
Although many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had gifts consisting of unusual or uncommon delicacies, including boar, peacock, dormouse, and a rodent called glis.
Another difference is this: while poor people and women ate their meals sitting on the floor, rich men preferred to hold banquets together and recline while eating at them.
Among the food of ancient Rome, there could not have been foods that came to Europe from America or later centuries in Asia.
For example, they don't have corn, or tomatoes, or beets, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman has ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, considered a house of God.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, while priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every place of worship had an open porch, and then a sacred chamber inside, accessible only to priests.
Sometimes they built unique tower-like structures resembling pyramids, called ziggurats, as part of temples.
The minaret's top was a special sacred place of God.
In the warm climate of the Near East, a home wasn't quite as important.
Much of the Jewish family’s life was spent outdoors.
Women prepared food in front of the gate; the shops were only open stalls facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland is very sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, they were exiled from Iceland for killing Erik the Red, and while traveling west, they discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, it was already inhabited at that time by Eskimo tribes.
Although each is a "Scandinavian country," the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are distinctly different.
If you've watched the film "Millennium Treasure" (National Treasure), you might think there's a treasure map written behind the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not the case. Even if something is written on the other side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written "Original of the Declaration of Independence dated 4th of July 1776." The text is written upside down in the lower portion of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that upon its completion, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was prepared for preservation.
Therefore, it is also possible that the inscription was added only as a symbol/mark.
On D-Day, the airborne landing and the subsequent course of battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south remains still unliberated.
There, the French of "Vichy" ruled. These French, instead of fighting, made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked on the side of the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an operation codenamed "Operation Dragoon."
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a rather large group of people living and working together – it is a distinct culture common to society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis," meaning relating to citizenship, and is connected to the Latin words "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or state, and also indicating the size of a society in some way.
City-states serve as the pioneers of nations. A civilized culture envisions the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, leaving a cultural legacy, and equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving sufficient historical evidence and cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the war for independence, the first central government formed by thirteen states was weak: based on the Articles of Confederation, Congress was its sole component.
Congress has no authority to levy taxes, and, due to the lack of a national executive or judicial system, it relies on state authorities to enforce its actions, which they often refuse to cooperate with.
He also does not have the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs in different states.
To amend the articles, unanimous consent of all states was required, but the states regarded the central government with great leniency, so their representatives often didn't even bother to attend.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, ranks second in the world based on team results and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion in football.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in northern regions, where Italians participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan consists of approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world by area!
Since its islands are located in a cluster/group, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan begins as early as the 15th century. At this time, European sailors passing by the island wrote its name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch West India Company established a base in northwestern Taiwan, altered the indigenous seed cultivation practices, and began employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) conquered the west and north coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
After its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki. According to it, sovereignty over Taiwan was transferred to Japan, and the island remained under its administration until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can better understand what they were like in the past.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used standard image size for photography is 35mm. It dominated during the recent analog film era.
It has been published up to the present day, but the most important thing is that its aspects shifted to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format, although quite unusual in reality, measures 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
This format's aspect ratio (when divided by twelve to create the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and frequently the subject of ridicule, is simply a guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in the composition.
The most useful place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, comes into the spotlight.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power influenced everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the fundamental principles of the Christian faith is that wealth should alleviate hardship and poverty, and church funds are collected for precisely that reason.
The central administration of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money in one place has led many to question whether this principle is being followed.
After the military operations began and some time passed, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The rationale behind this strategy – the cutting off of essential military and civilian supplies – was presented as necessary for life. However, this blockade, in general, violated international law, codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries and widely accepted.
Britain mined a complete section of the ocean – international waters – to the point that not a single ship could enter. This posed a threat even to neutral vessels.
Since this tactic had a limited response, Germany expected the same response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifist and isolationist views prevailed among the majority of citizens and nations.
Having witnessed the horror and savagery of World War I, nations desired to prevent such occurrences in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America at the invitation of the Edison Company in New York.
He arrives in the United States with his name, plus 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of advice to Thomas Edison from Charles Bachelor (his former boss).
In ancient China, there was a unique way of indicating different periods of time. Each period of China’s development or each family in power established a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of instability spread between each dynasty's provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Many ruthless wars took place among the numerous nobles who fought for the throne in those dark times.
The Era of Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people perished for the chance to sit in the highest position in the grand palace of Xi'an.
Using the metric system, transitioning from absolutism to republicanism, believing that national identity and the state should belong to the people rather than a single ruler – these have many social and political effects.
Also, after the Revolution, job opportunities opened up to all male claimants, and a path to achieving goals opened up for the most ambitious and successful.
This also applies to military service: previously, ranks in the army were given based on class distinctions, but now they are beginning to be awarded based on internal qualities.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class people in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this transient world. He often went to a cave, later known as “Hira,” on Mount “Nur” (light) for contemplation.
Even the cave, preserved until this time, clearly depicts Muhammad’s spiritual quests.
This cave, located on one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, even someone who knows it exists may not easily find it. Once you enter the cave, you find yourself in complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen but numerous mountains encircling with a clean, beautiful blue sky. From inside the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid located in Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, created by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, stands as one of the numerous pyramidal structures built in memory of the deceased Pharaohs.
In Egypt, on the Giza Plateau or in the "Giza Necropolis", there are several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest among them), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in memory of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in memory of Khufu’s wives and family members.
The "greater than" symbol resembles the letter V, while the "less than" symbol looks like a bracket or parenthesis with no bottom side.
When aiming upwards, you need to press the bow from the top down, and when aiming downwards – from the frog (this is where your hand holds the bow) down to the bow.
Generally, the upper bow produces a softer sound, while the lower bow produces a louder and harsher sound.
You can place your own marks, but remember that repeat marks are printed for musical purposes, and therefore generally require permission.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were driven from Versailles back to Paris by a group of market women.
A group of people shouting insults surrounded the carriage taking them back to Paris, addressed to the king and queen.
A group of people forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
At some moment, someone in the group shook the head of a royal guardsman killed in Versailles before the frightened queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover the majority of expenses and interest on bonds issued through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Certainly, the super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute a key benefit of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that motivated the order's formation.
The period when these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages – the period in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages there were the Early Middle Ages, and then came the Late Middle Ages, which conditionally ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas: from technological push or technological imperative, to a strict understanding driven by the logic that the fate of humanity is fundamentally linked to scientific laws and their reflection in technology.
Most proponents of technological determinism share two main ideas: the development of technology itself largely proceeds independently of cultural and political influences, and technology, in turn, “influences” organically arising societies rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the motor car led to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country is economically unviable for very few vehicles, therefore new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Mass production of cars also leads to a large number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the healthcare sector for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism contains a large portion of cultural determinism borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
If Paris is recognized as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its period of prosperity, as a center of wealth, began around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
Throughout the eleventh century, its status declined, largely due to returning with gifts such as silks and spices—which were more valuable than what the Crusaders offered in the markets of Byzantium.
The name of the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris precisely at that time.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was under the strong influence of the Byzantine Empire in the east.
However, due to the slow pace of interaction, Western styles could have lagged behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. The greatest achievement of that era was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to fasten their clothes with buttons.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture based on producing enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and their family.
Natural farming is a simple, primarily organic system that utilizes preserved seeds naturally occurring in the eco-region and relatively simple methods such as crop rotation to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this still exists in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel forgotten by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of unity.
Subcultures may differ based on the age, nationality, social class, location, and/or gender of their participants.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be a combination of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or other factors.
Representatives of subcultures often signal their involvement through distinctive and symbolic stylistic choices, including fashion, customs, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to cite several poignant examples of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their upbringing.
Children like these are called "feral" or simply wild. Some feral children have been deprived of freedom by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents' refusal to accept a child's severe mental or physical disability leads to such neglect of the child.
Neglected children may experience severe abuse or trauma before being fostered or running away.
It is believed they were raised by animals; some say they lived alone in the wild.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child almost always behaves exactly like that specific animal (taking into account physical limitations), including in terms of their fears and indifference towards people.
If project-based learning is meant to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes another step.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather consists of more support measures, helping people experience new learning, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding measures can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is also a form of scaffolding, as is a person like a small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding measures are embedded within the software and should be able to prompt, suggest, and explain procedures that the learner might find difficult to ask about, propose, or perform independently.
Children are given to foster families for various reasons, ranging from deprivation to abuse and even abandonment.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, comfort, and educate, yet that is often the case.
We consider the patronage upbringing system to be a safe space for those children.
Our foster care system should ensure safe homes, loving guardians, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The family who took them in should satisfy all the needs that were unmet in their previous home.
It combines elements of both mass and personal communication, and the internet.
The distinct characteristics of the internet reveal additional aspects from the perspective of usage and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are presented as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when examining audience reactions to websites.
Significant breakthroughs have been made in the field of interpreting facial micro-expressions, lasting several milliseconds, with the help of video recording.
It is believed that a person's deceit can be detected by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," demonstrated that people who could not comprehend speech due to brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately identify sincerity.
He even suggests that the ability to interpret a person's behavior in this way might exist even in animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown the existence of two types of genetic variations: latent and expressed.
Mutation gives rise to new genetic variation, and natural selection eliminates it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination transfer variation back and forth between two groups with each generation.
It is difficult for primates with a simple digestive system resembling that of humans to satisfy their need for amino acids from plant resources in the savannah.
It's not just him; failing to do so leads to dire consequences: stunted development, a hand-to-mouth existence, and ultimately, death.
Leaf and legume proteins could serve as the easiest-to-use plant resources, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest when raw.
On the contrary, food from animals (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also contains a large number of proteins that include all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our very ancient ancestors, to some extent, solved their own "subsistence problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Waking up after sleep onset is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
You can gently wake up by bringing yourself to consciousness with the help of a relatively quiet alarm without fully waking up.
If it is determined that you turn off the alarm clock while sleeping, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Based on biorhythms, another option is to drink plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, a mild diuretic) to wake a person up for urination.
The extent of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the anxiety, the greater the positive life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve opening their heart. The only thing standing in the way on this path is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is expanded by the Mahayana path of love and with the help of many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of the path of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and all-embracing love.
With the help of Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of the opening of the heart) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation lies divine yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and an understanding of the opening of the heart arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which is why the USSR and the USA cooperated. After the war ended, a clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to a breakdown in relations between these countries.
Two years had passed since the end of the war, and former colleagues had already become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
He was supposed to continue for 40 years and would have led to real wars with the help of foreign armies, from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been shattered, and regrouping through the Romanian bridgehead remained the only hope.
However, these plans almost immediately became obsolete, because the Soviet Union, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, invaded Poland’s eastern territories with over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is, undoubtedly, the most efficient way of transferring large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The work of the naval forces generally consists of ensuring the ability to transport one's own country's people and goods, but at the same time, not allowing the possibility of transporting the enemy's people and goods.
Not long ago, one of the clearest examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans, in order to help Great Britain, tried to transport their personnel and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using submarines, attempted to stop this operation.
If the Allies had suffered a defeat, Germany could have conquered Britain, perhaps like it conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats, as you can see, were first domesticated as livestock in the Zagros Mountains of Iran approximately 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate cattle for the easy use of milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Goats were usually kept in herds grazing along hillsides or other pastures. Often, children or teenagers, globally referred to as "shepherds," tended to the goats. These herding practices are still used today.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although carriage roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed draft horses to develop great speed and haul large loads on the uneven roads of that time.
The matches were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. Afterwards, gradually, as the iron plate covered the wheelset, it became clear that the wheelsets would become even more effective.
This became a common practice, but iron, and consequently wooden wagon wheels, wore out faster.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. The first fully iron rails appeared in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was riding on horseback. With the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright walking man") two million years ago, people began to walk upright.
Their ancestors – australopithecines – did not usually walk upright.
Many specializations were identified in the fossilized remains of australopithecines dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can start living in harmony with the environment, join environmental movements, and even become activists.
In many cases, it seems like this is symptomatic treatment. But if we don’t just want a temporary fix, then we need to find the root of the problem and stop it from becoming active.
Thanks to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, the world has changed significantly, but problems have increased due to the excessive population and extravagant lifestyles of people.
After being adopted by Congress, on July 4th the manuscript draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the John Dunlap printing shop, several blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and they are now known as "The Broad Sides of Danlap."
The reading of the document to the public for the first time was conducted by John Nixon on July 8th in front of the Independence Hall.
A copy of the document was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
To date, the 25 extensively studied aspects of Danlap are considered the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But even now, birds resembling dinosaurs have many distinctive features.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all of today's computers are based on manipulating information encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers or, in computer jargon, bits.
Internal bleeding may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as dizziness are common, therefore a diagnosis shouldn’t be made right away.
The best sign of indoor pollution is the presence of open containers with medicine or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label for instructions, and on the label for first aid for a specific poison, following the instructions.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The origins of this term date back to ancient times – to familiarity with leeches, which have become very well adapted to being parasites in humans.
Both ticks and lice are parasitic insects that have adapted to live in nests or on their hosts.
Approximately 400,000 cases of disseminated sclerosis are registered in the United States, which identifies it as a neurological disease in older and middle-aged people.
Disseminated sclerosis is a disease that damages the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
The court can decide whether or not parents need to raise children in their interests and in the child's best interests.
This couple may decide to make a plan to adopt a child.
To become the second set of parents to a child, the biological parents must relinquish their parental rights upon adoption.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world is structured using the scientific method. Most scientific research relies on this method in practice.
But it is not the only experiment. An experiment is a test used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and conduct observations, as well as direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers turned their attention to classical texts, particularly to the Vulgate Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted with regard to all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West began to detach itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Rhythms observed in the physiology and order of organisms, often due to the presence of endogenous cycles, are strictly linked to the production of those cycles with the help of biological clocks.
Not only external temporal signals, but also recorded temporal rhythms including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a free-running cycle even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the leading hypotheses proving that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the phage’s DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage’s proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have varying consequences depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected site in the genetic material, and the importance of the cells affected by the resulting cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or the development of cancer.
People interested in entering natural territories due to the beauty of natural phenomena, considering the plant and animal world, are attracted by nature tourism.
Activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, entering parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
As an example, it involves entering the orangutan habitat in Borneo, photographing them, and studying them.
Every morning, people in small towns get into their cars and drive to work, and others come to the workplaces they left behind.
In this dynamic transport network, everyone is reliant on and approves of a transport system based on personal vehicles.
Currently, as science shows, this large-scale carbon economy has moved the biosphere out of the stable state that sustained human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in public life and uses transportation systems. But almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints regarding water quality or due to the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints? Why do they break down daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something else, more fundamentally, being done wrong?
Traffic flow is the science of driver behavior, the movement of vehicles between two directions, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, because it is impossible to predict the driver's behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers, as a rule, behave quite predictably within a certain range. Thus, traffic flows have a kind of rational order and can be approximately represented by mathematical figures.
To better visualize traffic flow, three key characteristics were identified: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This helps in planning, designing, and operating roadbed objects.
Insects were among the first animals to take to the air. With the ability to fly, they could escape from predators and find food and mates more effectively.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings back along their bodies.
This allows them to find more small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects unable to fold their wings back – are grasshoppers and bush crickets.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people agreed with him, but many believed the opposite – that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It sounds very convincing, because it doesn't resemble an earthquake at all, does it?
The Amazon River is the longest and largest river. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles.
A full 20 percent of all the water flowing from rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Its water collects from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one has surpassed the Great Pyramids of Giza in terms of size and technical perfection in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom gazed in awe at monuments built by those before them, monuments that were already over a thousand years old in their time.
Around 800 people live in Vatican City. This is the world's smallest independent country and the least populated state.
Italian is used for legislation and official communication in Vatican City.
Italian is also the everyday language of communication for many people working in this country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens in Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known simple chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of them can be found in nature in their native form and extracted with relative ease using primitive tools.
Aristotle, as a philosopher, proposed the theory that everything is formed by the combination of one or more of four elements. These elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. But, in his opinion, they transform into new substances to form the things we see.
Alloys – are mixtures of two or more metals in their base. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are accepted as metals. There are also metals like silver and gold, of course.
Alloys can also include non-metallic elements in small amounts, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Thanks to this, the pencil, even after its creation, becomes a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the importance and frequency of use of the pencil are decreasing.
People now write letters on computer screens and don't even come close to using pens.
If something new comes along, one can only dream about what the keyboard will become.
The operating principle of a hydrogen bomb is based on the need for energy to compress many protons and neutrons into one nucleus.
It felt like pushing a heavy cart uphill to the mountain peak. Re-experiencing the dream releases a certain amount of that energy again.
Some atoms are unstable, meaning they tend to separate even with a slight external influence or even spontaneously.
The surface of the Moon consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria, but thicker under the high mountains.
There may be more maria on the side, because the shell is thinner. That's why the lava easily reached the surface.
In content theories, finding things that people will mark or be attracted to is central.
According to these theories, people have specific needs and/or desires that are gradually satisfied as they mature.
These theories study what motivated the actions of certain people and what phenomena in their surroundings led them to perform or not perform those actions.
The two most popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when leaders begin to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain “one of the guys (or girls).”
This type of leaders struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, they transform into someone unrecognizable. This man or woman—or team—believes that everything done up to this point needs to be fundamentally changed and made their own.
Ultimately, the leader is fully responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams rely on the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a connecting point for physical groups who frequently work together.
They are much more independent than typical team members, because they can meet even in cases that local leadership might not understand, regardless of different time zones.
The existence of a true “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is another unique component of a virtual team.
“The invisible team” is a governing group where every member is accountable. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to reach a learning state? One of the goals of implementing the learning organization concept is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across an organization’s functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Thus, a new innovative way of meeting user needs may be revealed as a result of the collaborative process of developing the organization's core.
For an organization to be innovative, the leadership, along with an innovative culture, must create knowledge sharing and organized learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of productivity.
Neurobiological data serves as physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying cognition. This expands the research field and significantly increases its accuracy.
The correlation between a patient's pathology and their behavior helps scientists in their research.
The association between concussion, trauma, poisoning and swelling affecting grip, and leading to changes in certain cognitive functions has been known for a long time.
The development of new technologies opens up opportunities for us to observe the structure and processes of matter that were previously unseen.
He/She brings us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models. These models help us understand the processes of our minds.
Despite having the hallmarks of strong science fiction, artificial intelligence forms a very important branch of computer science responsible for machine learning, knowledge acquisition, and intellectual adaptation.
Automation falls within the scope of tasks in the field of AI that require intelligent handling from machines.
Controlling, planning and organizing such instances, the ability to respond to user needs and requests, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition are included.
Such things have turned into separate disciplines that ensure the solving of real problems of life.
A neural network and artificial intelligence system built in video game software is currently widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military field.
Excursions are a significant part of every lesson. Often, a teacher wants to show their students places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology suggests solving this with the help of a virtual tour. Students can view museum exhibits, enter an aquarium, or admire works of fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing the excursion virtually is also a great way to think about travel and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their annual trips to the state capital. It is updated every year, but its previous versions are stored online and serve as an archive.
Blogs also help to improve readers' writing skills. Although readers often start blogging with soft grammar and spelling, this usually changes thanks to their audience.
Since students are often the most demanding audience, a blogger, in order to avoid criticism, begins to refine their writing style.
At the same time, blogging "forces readers to learn more about the world around them." The need to maintain audience attention encourages readers to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Maintaining a blog is a means of encouraging collaboration and inspiring learners to broaden their education far beyond the traditional school day.
Using blogs effectively can "enhance readers’ analytical and critical thinking skills. By actively responding to online materials, readers can define their perspectives in the context of other writings and form their personal opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's impressive bilingual capital. Here you'll find many clock galleries and museums depicting Canada's past and present.
Far to the south lies Niagara Falls, while the northern part is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and others.
These and others highlight Ontario being considered a true Canadian by outsiders.
In the vast territories of the far north, the population is very sparse, and some places are completely wild.
Comparing by population size that has caused much suffering: The number of African Americans living in the USA is larger than the number of citizens of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest and, in terms of its wild nature, a truly unique continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or are associated with France and are known as upscale beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became widely practiced in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened a route from Europe to India via the Cape Route.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, while in the south and west – the Atlantic Ocean.
Women. It is advisable to refer to female travelers as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also beneficial (as long as it doesn't look overly valuable).
Women need to understand that, due to cultural differences, situations may be perceived as harassment, and such instances of harassment are often encountered, for example, being held by the hand, etc.
Stand firm against men decisively and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether or not there are cultural differences – this is not a normal phenomenon!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and, when rebuilding it, changed its name to Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Badia, while Spanish merchants who founded trading posts here called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to wander around the shops in all of Morocco.
It’s easy to find places around the Old Medina selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather products, hookahs and many other kinds of knick-knacks, but all of this is mainly for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano buried most of the streets of Goma city, especially the city center, and destroyed the city.
Even though Goma is relatively safe, it is necessary to study all instances of leaving Goma in order to understand the state of the ongoing military operations in North Kivu province.
Besides being one of the best places to observe the rarest mountain gorillas in Africa, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyragongo volcano.
It is possible to use boda-bodas (mototaxis) to get around the city. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Although reaching it was relatively difficult, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but due to its prestige, it is a place that attracts tourists, and it even has an airport.
In 1990, due to its unique sandy landscapes, it was included in the list of endangered World Heritage Sites.
He was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s "Wonderful World of Africa" series on PBS.
The city strongly differs from other cities in the country, because it has more Arabic flavor than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border lies along the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with its own diverse wildlife and plant life.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, this park also charges a daily conservation fee and an entrance fee.
It might also be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
The name of the Hong Kong territory originates from Hong Kong Island, and this island is a place that particularly attracts the attention of many tourists.
The buildings creating Hong Kong's skyline can be compared to a shimmering histogram, as clearly demonstrated by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon shore.
A large portion of urban development in Hong Kong is densely concentrated in reclaimed land areas along the northern shore.
This is a place that was taken over by British colonizers, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence confirming the colonial history of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the inland districts of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest located within the territory of India is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not only vast woodlands, but also the last remnants of the powerful jungle forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², one-third of which consists of waterlogged or marshy areas.
Since 1966, it has been the Sundarbans National Park, and, according to estimates, currently around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer live in this area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and to Dzhakar or Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses in the area are often full, it is necessary to buy a ticket several days in advance.
In most districts, comfortable and reliable small Japanese Coaster buses operate.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two viaducts are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and 3.50 meters wide with two lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it remained closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, after the construction of Brazilian customs posts is completed.
The Guarani are the largest indigenous group who inhabited the territory of present-day Eastern Paraguay, and they were nomadic hunters also engaged in natural agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to local tribes such as the Guayakú and Paiaguá, who were engaged in hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, initially called the "giant province of Hindustan," emerged as a result of the conflict between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples in the 16th century.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its foundation in 1537, Asunción has been able to preserve its local mentality and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament will be held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
You can also watch small tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
You can find news about tournaments and places where tickets for polo matches are sold on the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is valued at par with the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
Throughout the islands, British pounds are generally accepted for payment, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
While British and US currency may be accepted in more remote areas, credit cards might not be; it’s best to find out from the owners in advance what payment methods are convenient.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it experiences summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and the temperature during the summer months is usually above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: even if the temperature rarely drops below zero, due to the wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons here: the amount of precipitation remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild nature remains wild, and it is not right to feed or disturb it.
According to the park administration, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from the bear and wolf, and at least 25 yards/meters away!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, moose, bears and all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of entrants flounder due to failing to cover the required distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so allow them to act freely.
In addition, remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted by smells, so refrain from bringing or preparing fragrant products and maintain cleanliness in the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and its population reaches 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850, and has officially been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of the unfortunate, well-known naval standoff of 1889. At that time, seven ships of Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the bay.
All ships except for one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the Mau movement and the struggle for independence, the uprising in the city culminated in the assassination of the paramount chief of the main leadership, Tu'ua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is located between two bays, it has many beaches. The most popular are in three places.
The north shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly safe for swimming, sandy beaches, and many of them have shade from pohutukawa trees (New Zealand Christmas trees).
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches where there are often many people and various shops located along the shore. Entering the water is safe.
The main local beer is named "Number One." It's not complex, but pleasant and invigorating. The second local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are probably more readily available.
Tap water is drinkable, but if you are unsure, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, thinking about "flat white" coffee is irrelevant. They have black coffee "espresso", cappuccino with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Berry juice is expensive, but very good.
There are many trips towards the reef throughout the year, and the injuries resulting from these causes are rare in the rift.
Despite this, listen to the authorities' advice, follow all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish can be found from October to April near beaches and river mouths, migrating northwards since 1770. Occasionally, they can be seen outside of this period as well.
Sharks are seen in these waters, but attacks on people are rare. Most of them are afraid of humans and swim away without getting close.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the river estuaries stretching north from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler confidence in where they will spend the night after arriving at their designated destination.
Tourist agencies often make agreements with well-known hotels. However, through a travel agency you can find the possibility to book different types of accommodation, for example, camping sites.
Tourist agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to or from the airport, or combined packages including flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to consider the offer or to formalize other documents for the trip (for example, a visa).
However, any amendments or requests should be sent not directly to the hotel, but through the agency.
At some festivals, especially music festivals, most participants decide to set up camp in one place, and most of them consider this a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be closer to the stage, you should come earlier to get a spot not too far from the music.
Even though the music has finished on the main stages, keep in mind that music will likely continue to play at some venues of the festival until nightfall.
Some festivals provide small families with special camping areas.
When crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the placement of cabins, as a creaking, harsh sound occurs when passing through the ice, which can have a strong effect, especially for sensitive people.
River cruises along Saint Petersburg include time spent living in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally put a lot of effort into maximizing the money guests leave behind and the time they spend there. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and finding the exit can be difficult.
Typically, they create special offers regarding food, drinks, and entertainment to ensure guests are in a good mood and keep them staying.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the company’s account. But drinking ruins the mind, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to travel in high altitudes or through mountain passes should account for the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is low, and you can't drive as if you were on asphalt.
In a short time, to get snowed in, during a blizzard it is possible for a lot of snow to fall.
Visibility may be limited due to falling snow or blizzard conditions, as well as ice forming on condensers or vehicle windshields.
On the other hand, in many countries, ice and snow are normal occurrences, and traffic, for the most part, does not stop year-round.
Safari is probably the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important event for many visitors.
The term "safari" refers to a journey across land with the aim of observing the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and simple devices can help them see them better and stay safe.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be afraid of people, so you can use binoculars to observe them better.
Hiking (also called "walking tour", "foot travel" or "hiking trip") includes walking trips lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some competitions will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice within its territory, as it had its first experience of hosting the Olympics in 1964.
If you booked tickets for the flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The return policy changes, but considering the situation at the end of March, most of the return policies that arose due to coronavirus do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were planned.
Tickets for the evenings are expected to range from 2,500 to 130,000 yuan, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 yuan.
Ironing loose clothing can help it drape better. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for temporary use, even if they are not available in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed boots, try using your hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (this can cause it to shrink or, in the worst case, catch fire).
There are various methods of cleaning chimneys, some of which are more effective against specific types of blockage.
In some areas, it’s enough to boil water in a minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters differ in effectiveness, and if you are unsure, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar and dangerous animals and insects in their homeland.
Ticks can spoil food, cause skin diseases, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.

The section of the road between Point Marion and Fairmont is considered the most challenging place to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, and it often passes through remote areas.
If you are not used to driving along country roads, be patient: here there are steep climbs, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The designated speed limits are much lower than those on the preceding and following sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and adhering to them strictly is more important than in other cases.
What’s interesting is that the mobile connection is much better here compared to other parts of the route (for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds).
German flour products are very good, especially in Bavaria, just like in its southern neighbor Austria – quite rich and diverse.
Baked goods with berries and fruits are a common sight: apple pies are baked year-round, while cherries and plums are available in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes go particularly well with strong coffee.
If you're looking for a small but satisfying pastry, consider trying Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on what region you are in.

Indonesian cuisine, consisting of over 17,000 islands, is a collective term encompassing the diversity of local dishes that can be found throughout the country.
However, if used without additional explanations, this term generally refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island (Java).
Currently, Javanese cuisine is widely spread throughout the archipelago and includes many simple, flavorful dishes. Peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices are among the flavorings preferred by Javanese people.
Stirrups – supports for the feet of a rider, suspended on both sides of the saddle.
They ensure the stability of the sled, but they can pose a danger as the sled's runners can get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse and their legs get caught in the stirrups, and the horse bolts, they might be dragged along. To reduce the likelihood of such a danger, safety precautions should be taken.
Firstly, most cavalrymen wore heeled and soft, rather narrow-toed boots, specially made for riding horses.
In addition, some reins, especially English reins, have safety releases that allow the rider to slip the rein if pulled back hard by a falling horse, preventing them from being dragged.
The heart of the area features various large granite walls and cliffs. It is known as Yosemite in South America and serves as a prime rock climbing location in Chile.
Breathtaking views open up from the mountain peaks. Climbers who come from different corners of the world constantly create new routes among the endless potential of the walls.
Mountain sports, including skiing and snowboarding, and gliding down snowy slopes with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet – are popular sports.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities, and many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as "ski bums," dedicate an entire vacation to skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very ancient – rock carvings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Mountain skis, as a sport, have been known since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also known as ski mountaineering, ski hiking, or backcountry skiing in wild natural conditions.
This is related to skiing or alpinism in the Alpine style, but generally doesn't include them – the latter is done on steep mountain slopes and requires even more demanding skis and boots.
Think of it as thinking about a similar hiking route to the Changy route.
Under good conditions, you can cover greater distances walking – but with heavy backpacks on prepared trails, cross-country skis rarely achieve the speed of walking.
Europe is a continent consisting of numerous independent countries, even if it isn't particularly large. In simple terms, you would have to obtain visas multiple times and go through passport controls to travel through several countries.
But the Schengen zone is like one country in this case.
When within this zone, as a rule, you do not need to repeatedly pass through border control checkpoints that check passports when crossing borders.
Also, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to submit a separate application for a visa to each country participating in the Schengen area, and this saves time and money and reduces paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities consider goods over 100 years old to be antiques.
This definition can vary depending on the geographical location; compared to Europe, even newer items in places like North America might be considered antiques.
Even if handicrafts are mass-produced after similar goods, they can still be considered antiques.
Raising bulls is a source of livelihood for many people, and the culture associated with this occupation is also important for many other professionals.

For example, American citizens may encounter situations in the Middle East that differ from those experienced by Europeans or Arabs.
Recommendations are simply a brief description of the political situation in the country.
The ideas presented are often superficial, general, and simplified, studied only briefly, in comparison with the detailed information shown in other sources.

The readiness of foreign governments to accept these documents also varies.
Inspections at border control points have become significantly more rigorous since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals should be prepared for the possibility that scans during surgery may not protect the privacy and dignity of their personal lives.
Rip currents are currents that return from the impact of waves on the shore, often on underwater slopes and similar areas.
Regarding underwater topography, the return current accumulates in several deep areas, and a fast current can form there in deep water.
The cause of most deaths is people exhausting themselves trying to swim against the current, when it’s impossible to swim against the current.
Going with the flow and swimming back is not more difficult than usual.
Try to steer yourself to a place where you won’t be caught by the returning currents, or, depending on your skill and whether they see you, you might prefer to hope they rescue you themselves.
Recurrent varroa shock develops faster (with fewer honey bees), lasts longer, and can be more severe than cultural shock.
For travelers who quickly adapt to a new culture, returning to their own culture can sometimes be very difficult.
After living abroad and returning to your home, you become accustomed to a new culture, and some of the customs characteristic of your own culture are lost within you.
Initially, when people go abroad, they are probably patient and understanding, because they know that travelers to a new country need time to adjust.
One might not think that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The Pyramid sound and light show is one of the most exciting things for children in this place.
Before the performance begins, you can see the pyramids in darkness and silence.

Among others, there's Livingston Island and Deception Island, which features an impressive natural harbor formed in the water-filled caldera of an still-active volcano.
Elsurt Land is a region bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea, located south of the peninsula.
The Bruce Peninsula mountains connect here with a plateau, then reappear, forming the 360 km Ellsworth Mountains ridge, centrally divided by the Minnesota Ice Sheet.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains of Antarctica – the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson being its highest point at 4892 m.
In remote areas with no fixed communication, satellite phones may be the only option.
Generally speaking, a satellite phone does not replace a mobile phone, because to make a call you need to be in a place with a clear view of the satellite in open air.
This service is often used in the field of vessel traffic, including on cruise ships, as well as in expeditions requiring remote data transmission and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider can provide more information about connecting to this service.
Traveling and studying are becoming a popular option for those planning to take a gap year.

Typically, a fee is charged for participating in these educational programs.
Finland is a large country. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are thousands of islands, in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, you might not even need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are truly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaks leave a completely different impression.
Swimming in a tub boat is a traditional form of recreation in Finland, where there is one tub boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but unique elsewhere (for example, this indicator is one in forty in the Netherlands).
Most Baltic Sea cruises include a significant stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
It means you can come to the historical city for these two full days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only go on excursions with a yacht/ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures mention Berlin, Germany. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not located on the coast at all, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.

Courier companies are paid well for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, commercial goods, and spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but problems have arisen with other routes and smaller firms.
If items are shipped by air transport, it could take several days for clearance and customs processing.
The only way to get it here faster was to send it as registered baggage. Airline rules wouldn’t allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
An open secret to flying in first or business class – is accumulating a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, getting your company to pay for you).
But this is by no means cheap: based on experience, roughly speaking, you may have to pay four times as much for business class compared to a standard economy class fare, and eleven times as much for first class!
Generally speaking, searching for discounts on first or business class seats for direct flights from point A to point B is pointless.
Airlines are very well aware that certain key groups of passengers are willing to pay large sums of money to travel quickly and comfortably anywhere, and therefore set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also often used.

Observatories built before the modern era generally now are outdated and function only as museums or educational sites.
Since they bloomed in a time when the light wasn't as intense as it is today, they were usually located in cities or on campuses, therefore reaching their former glory is easier than building something new today.
Most modern research telescopes are very large structures located in places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The custom of observing the blossoming of the cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
