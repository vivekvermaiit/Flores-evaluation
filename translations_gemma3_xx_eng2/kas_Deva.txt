This is a difficult sentence with some transliteration issues, but here's the best possible translation, accounting for likely intended meanings and common Kashmiri phrasing: This is about how USOC (United States Olympic Committee) has expressed agreement with the changes made within the organization by the players themselves, and how these changes will lead to improvements in the performance of Kashmiri athletes and benefit Indian interests as well. **Important Notes on the translation challenges:** * **Transliteration:** The Devanagari to Roman transliteration is imperfect, leading to ambiguity. I've made educated guesses based on context and common Kashmiri words. "किलबन" is likely a transliteration error for "खिलाड़ियों" (khiladiyon - players). "हिन्द मफ़दात" is likely "Hind mafadat" - interests of India. * **Word Order:** Kashmiri sentence structure can be flexible. I've reordered for natural English flow. * **Nuance:** Some Kashmiri words carry cultural weight that's hard to capture perfectly in English. "इतिफाक़" (itifaak) is more than just "agreement" – it implies a harmonious coming together of minds. * **USOC Context:** The mention of USOC suggests the sentence likely relates to a sports-related development or agreement.
The USA gymnastics investigation has supported a free and fair inquiry, and despite the darkness and difficulties, the truth has come to light.

The "-has" ending suggests addressing a group. * **मंज़ (Manz):** "There" or "in that place." * **ओश (Oash):** "Was" or "were". * **हारान (Haaran):** "Said". * **तेम (Tem):** "Then". * **कोर (Kor):** "Someone" or "one". * **पन्नयन (Pannayan):** "That book" or "this book" (context clarifies 'that'). * **मदाहन (Madahaan):** "To bring". * **वाज़ियह (Waaziyah):** A form of "to ask" or "requested". * **ज़ि (Zi):** "To" or "for". * **यी (Yi):** "Her". * **वापस (Waapas):** "Back". It's important to note that without context or a clearer transliteration, this is the best possible interpretation. Kashmiri transliteration from Devanagari can be ambiguous.

This is a difficult sentence with some potentially ambiguous phrasing, but here's the most accurate translation I can provide, aiming for natural English while respecting the nuance: “It is said that a strong thing (or a valuable resource) is hidden within a populated group (or a densely populated area), not in a separate, isolated place – (if you find it in a mountain range or a riverbed, or if you find it on a small island, it won't be easily found again). You are often found amidst various environments.” **Important Notes on the translation choices:** * **"येली अकीस जानदार चीज़" (Yeli akis jaandaar cheez):** "येली अकीस" is idiomatic and translates roughly to "it is said that..." "जानदार चीज़" literally means "living thing" but in context likely means something valuable or powerful – hence "strong thing" or “valuable resource”. * **"हुक लकुट गरोह (अख लकित आबादी)" (Huk lakut garoh (akh lakit aabaadi)):** “Lakut garoh” translates to “hidden group” and "akh lakit aabaadi" means “densely populated area”. Both imply a concentrated group of people. * **"मरकज़ी आबादी नख अलग सपदान" (Markazi aabaadi nakh alg sapdaan):** "Not in a separate/isolated place". * **The conditional clause (the long part in parentheses):** This is complex. I’ve tried to maintain the sense of difficulty in finding it if you search in remote/unusual places. * **"अक्सर पानस अकीस मुखतालीफ़ महोल हस मंज़ पावन” (aksar paanas akis mukhtalif mahol has manz paawan):** “You are often found amidst various environments.” - This suggests a person or concept is adaptable and appears in many situations.

This Sindhi woman, in this age, still has an extra level of ease, meaning, there's no point in explaining further because it's obvious how capable she is – there’s no room for doubt."

Babylonians considered the inhabitants to be, but first, a god had built a fundamental temple, understanding the god’s beautiful home like this.
People offer sacrifices to gods and goddesses; priests engage in discussions and celebrations. Hindu deities have needs, and we should strive to fulfill those needs.
The first temple was of stone and had an open courtyard; inside the husband (priest) and his inner respect (consort/wife) were present, and only that priest received donations.
Once upon a time, there were towering structures, like ziggurats; such temples were built in India, following the ancient method of construction.

If you enjoyed the movie National Treasure, then surely you’ll love this tale; a freedom fighter hid a treasure, and a map and a pen are the key to finding it.
However, this is not a pose. Although the document may seem to be about something written, it is not a treasure or a map.
The question of what constitutes the true words of "freedom" – truly, the declaration made on July 4, 1776 – is a document written, perhaps, in reverse.

The word 'civilization' comes from Latin 'civilis', meaning civil, the Latin 'civis' relates to it, which means urban, then 'civitas', which means city or city-state, and thus it signifies a size/scale where people live together in an organized manner.
Urban-statehood is merely a facade. And the essence of culture is that it shouldn’t be limited to the knowledge of a few, rather cultural steps should be disseminated justly and widely.
A flexible culture is often better than rigid traditions; to finish something without experiencing hardship is not appropriate; civilization is that which accepts your path, and failing to do so is a disgrace.
During the revolutionary war, three states were formed – a strong and weak central government – Congress was one of those, under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress doesn't have the authority to impose taxes or levies; neither an executive nor a judicial body has it, and the state authorities haven’t fully implemented the necessary regulations for this. Often, this cooperation isn't achieved, and it depends on circumstances.
And now, regarding the issue between India and Pakistan, the tariff elimination authority rests with them.
The article discusses amendments brought about, and all the states require consent for these amendments; the states and the central government have a slight difference of opinion regarding this, making it difficult to reach a consensus, and representatives from many are often absent during discussions.

In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, changing the local agricultural production methods, employing Chinese laborers, and building many large forts, reportedly.
From the mid-17th century, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) controlled much of Taiwan, though western Taiwan remained under Dutch and Spanish control until 1885, when it was formally incorporated into the Qing Empire.
During the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), China was defeated, and the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki. As a result, Japan gained autonomous control over Taiwan, which it governed until 1945, after which the island came under its rule.
Machu Picchu includes several important structures, among them are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
We shouldn't build any more buildings in the complex; it’s better this way so that tourists can experience this place as it truly is and it remains visible.
So, apparently, I heard that Machu Picchu is worth visiting, and it’s said to be beautiful, and one should go there.

The 35mm format is actually a bit disturbing, 36mm is longer than 24mm.

This question seems to be a bit complex, and the provided Kashmiri sentence appears to contain a mix of Kashmiri and potentially Urdu/Persian loanwords, and some transliteration issues. However, based on my understanding and resources, here's the best possible translation: “Truly, this is a significant matter, and it’s a very old problem. It seems like everything is crumbling, and there’s no strength or respect left. Many questions arise – what is the basis of all this, and what is the complete solution?” **Important Notes:** * **Dialect & Variation:** Kashmiri has regional dialects, and the specific wording can vary. * **Transliteration:** The Devanagari transliteration might not be perfect, leading to interpretation challenges. * **Loanwords:** The sentence contains words borrowed from Urdu and Persian, common in Kashmiri speech. I've tried to convey the meaning accurately, considering these influences. * **Context:** Without broader context, it's harder to be 100% certain of the precise nuance.

Ancient China had different customs and unique ways of life; in China, whether it was in cities or villages, the Yus and Iktidars were a prominent family among those families.
That was a time of great instability and upheaval, as the inheritance was divided among families. This conflict, known as the Three Kingdoms period, lasted for 60 years between the Wei, Shu, and Wu states, and during the Jin Dynasty.
During this invasion, a fierce battle was fought for the throne of the kings.
The story of the Three Kingdoms is set in ancient China, and within its bloody period, there was a man who, though not of great stature, possessed immense talent – he often sacrificed himself for the well-being of others.
This sentence speaks to the societal and political impact of adopting a metric system, the complete abandonment of inherited republics, and the worship and belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a few rulers.

This is a difficult sentence with colloquialisms and potential transcription errors, but here's the best possible translation, aiming for meaning rather than a strictly literal rendering: "If you mean 'yes' to me, start slowly and carefully, and I will ease the pressure on you; and if you mean 'no' to me, start very slowly (so I understand your feelings), otherwise things will get worse, and I will be annoyed." **Important Notes on the translation and challenges:** * **हियुर (hiur) / गोव (gov) / पज़ी (pazi):** These are highly contextual and colloquial. "Gov" often functions as a particle indicating a question or seeking confirmation. "Pazi" here seems to mean "to me" or "with me." "Hiur" is likely 'yes'. * **तुटिस पेठ (tutis path) / मिनि पेठ (mini path):** These phrases meaning "slowly and carefully/ gradually" & "very slowly" are common ways to express needing a gentle approach. * **दबावुन (dabavun) / दबाव (dabav):** 'pressure' – likely emotional or relational pressure. * **तोन्दिस (tondis):** This seems to be related to "feelings" or understanding someone's emotional state. * **अथस (athas) / कमांस (kamans) / थ्फ छा (thaf cha):** This part is very challenging, likely a warning about escalating consequences ("things will get worse") and expressing annoyance. * **कमानस (kamanas) / लमुन (lamun):** Expresses annoyance or displeasure. Because of the informal nature and potential transcription errors in the original text, this translation is an interpretation based on the most plausible meaning within the Kashmiri context.

This habit led to its eventual capture, and this capture became a severe mental and physical trauma for it, driving it to seek revenge.
Having wandered around aimlessly for years, she finally found peace and comfort after accepting a government job.
The rest are accusations, it’s not upbringing, it’s the deeds of animals. Regarding them, this house isn’t suitable for spending a wild life like that.

Unfortunately, the provided Kashmiri text appears to be garbled and contains characters not typically found in standard Kashmiri written in Devanagari. It seems like a mix of characters, potentially including errors from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or incorrect transliteration. However, attempting a *best guess* based on potential word fragments and common Kashmiri phrasing, and acknowledging this is highly unreliable, a possible (and very tentative) translation could be: **"These insects and bed bugs are a serious problem for the house, and the team is also not finding a host or residence to travel with comfortably."** **Important Disclaimer:** This translation is extremely tentative due to the poor quality of the input text. It's highly likely to be inaccurate. A correct translation requires a clean, accurate Kashmiri Devanagari text.

But based on the rest of the sentence, the above translation is the most likely and natural.

It's hard to say with absolute certainty without context, as Kashmiri can be nuanced. However, a likely translation of: ऐटम छु यित नाक़ाबली यक़ीन हद ताम लकिट आसन ज़ि यथ जुमली कि आखिरस ताम गसन खराब ताम फिट। is: **This is a difficult situation; it was easy to look at, but living through it was ultimately a bad experience.** **Explanation of choices and difficulties:** * **ऐटम छु (Aitem chu):** This translates to "This is." * **यित (Yit):** "This" or "it", referring to the situation. * **नाक़ाबली (Naqabili):** "Inability" or more broadly, "difficulty" or "a difficult situation." Given the rest of the sentence, "difficulty" feels more fitting. * **यक़ीन (Yaqeen):** "Certainty" or "belief," often used to express assurance. In this context, it strengthens the "difficulty". * **हद ताम (Had tam):** "To a certain extent" or "regarding that." * **लकिट (Lakit):** "To look at" or "to see." * **आसन (Aasan):** "Easy." * **ज़ि (Zi):** "But" or "however." * **यथ (Yath):** "As" or "while." * **जुमली कि (Zumli ki):** "In total" or "ultimately" or "at the end". * **आखिरस (Akhiras):** "Finally" or "ultimately." Reinforces *Zumli ki*. * **ताम गसन (Tam gasan):** "To experience" or "to go through." * **खराब (Kharab):** "Bad" or "poor." * **ताम फिट (Tam fit):** "Was fitting" or "was appropriate" but in this context implies "was a bad fit" or simply "was bad". Because Kashmiri relies heavily on context, this is the *most probable* translation based on the words used. There might be slight variations depending on the specific dialect and intended meaning.

"Hīsh" refers to a task or undertaking. "Bārī" means big or difficult. "Gaḍ" means a hard or tough thing. The combination implies a very challenging undertaking. * **"लटकेयू पहाड़स पेठ" (laṭkayū pahāṛas peṭh):** “Laṭkayū” means to climb, and is used here in a past tense implying difficulty. “Pahāṛas” means mountains. “Peṭh” means upon/on. * **"नेऊकलेउस डोबारी तकसीम करून" (nēūkaleus dobārī taqsīm karun):** "Nēūkaleus" means new. "Dobarī" is a specific land measurement or area, common in certain regions. "Taqsīm" means division/partition. "Karun" means doing/having done. * **"तें पति एम पेठ किह तवानाई जेरी करान" (ten patī em peṭh kih tavānā'ī jerī karān):** "Ten" means that/it. "Patī" means portion/share. "Em" means to him. "Kih" means saying/that. "Tavānā'ī" means with good intention, gift, or generosity. "Jerī" means giving. "Karān" means to make someone do/cause to be done, in this case, implying a statement *caused* the giving.

Actually, in this case, it's more about deciphering and reconstructing a likely intended meaning, as the Devanagari is a bit unclear and potentially contains errors/typos common in transliterations from Kashmiri Romanization. However, based on the likely words and common Kashmiri phrasing, here's the most probable translation: **"It is said that in recent times, Americans and Europeans have been facing a lot of problems, especially with regard to their current situation."** **Explanation of challenges and choices made:** * **अक्की (Akki):** Likely means "It is said" or "reportedly." * **मिसाल (Misaal):** Means "example" or "in this instance," but used here to indicate a timeframe ("in recent times"). * **की (Ki):** A common connective particle. * **तोर (Tor):** Means "times" or "days." * **पैठ (Paeth):** Means "recently" or "in recent times." * **मशरिख वस्ति (Mashrik Vasti):** This part is harder. *Mashrik* can mean "East" but in this context, given the discussion of Americans and Europeans, it's likely a corrupted transliteration of something relating to the *present situation* or *current circumstances*. *Vasti* doesn't quite fit and is likely a typo. * **मन्ज़ (Manz):** "In" or "within." * **चू (Chu):** "Are" or "is/are" (copula). * **अमेरिकन लीकन (American Leekan):** "Americans." *Leekan* is a common way to say "people." * **यूरोपियन्स टी (Europeiyans Ti):** "Europeans too/also." * **अरबास सिथ (Arbaas Sith):** "A lot of problems." *Arbaas* means "many" or "a lot", and *Sith* means "problems". * **वारियिहान हालातन (Wariyihaan Haalatan):** This is tough, and where some reconstruction is needed. *Wariyihaan* suggests "facing" or "encountering". *Haalatan* relates to "situation" or "circumstances". * **हुंड (Hund):** "With regard to" or "concerning." * **सामना पेवान (Samana Pevan):** "Facing" or "confronting," reinforces the previous verb. * **करुण (Karun):** “Doing/Making," used here as part of the continuous aspect ("are facing"). It's important to remember that Kashmiri transliteration can be inconsistent, and without the original Romanized script or audio, a perfect translation is difficult. This is the most likely meaning based on the text provided and my expertise.
