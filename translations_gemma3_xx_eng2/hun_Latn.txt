This not only confirms that some dinosaurs were feathered, as that theory was already widespread, but also reveals details that fossils are generally unable to expose – such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top and a light or orange shade on the sides.
The discovery could provide insight into the evolution of bird plumage as well.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed quill, what is called a rachis, but possess other characteristics of feathers – barbules and down – researchers have concluded that rachises were likely a later evolutionary development in relation to these.
The structure of the feather suggests it wasn’t used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have determined that while this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern indicates adult plumage, not that of a juvenile.
Researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern suggests adult plumage rather than juvenile plumage.

In France, elections traditionally involve little technology: voters seclude themselves in a booth and place the pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter’s identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside before voting, and only properly counted and eligible voters may place envelopes inside.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all stages of the process. The votes will be counted by volunteers in the evening, under strict supervision and in compliance with clearly defined procedures.

In her other competition, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women's seated category, with a total running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungarian Dani Gyöngyi who finished ninth.
Four of the female skiers in the seated group were unable to finish the race, and out of the 117 skiers, 45 did not achieve a placement in the giant slalom.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Constable D K Arya stated: “We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency paramedics extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
They were first treated at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
They were later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
He is in custody until the indictment and the start of the trial, but any witness evidence could be compromised, as his image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
According to Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, “journalists are on a dangerous path if they publish photos or similar material of suspects.”
The Crown Office responsible for criminal proceedings informed journalists that they will no longer speak about the case before an indictment is filed.
According to the leaked information, the document concerns the territorial claims that Palestine wants based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Allegedly, among other topics discussed, were the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PLO is only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters involved in the supplementary pest control experiment were kept under strict supervision by gamekeepers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
NPWS and the New South Wales (NSW) Shooting Federation jointly recruited trained volunteers under the auspices of the Shooting Federation’s game management program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Managing Director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage Office, the four shooters selected for the first culling operation received comprehensive safety and practical training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new, nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures intended to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the postponement of elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases have been reported where malfunctioning iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and injuring four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving tools.
Over the past week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as “not serious.”
The ministry, in its response, called the postponement of Apple’s announcement “sincerely regrettable”.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (7:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked their bus, taking Hong Kong tourists hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Numerous hostages were rescued, but the deaths of at least six others were confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman, as the woman needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying premature birth in his spare time.
Her research has shown that administering a hormone can accelerate the development of a baby's fetal lungs.
According to a Xinhua report, government investigators found two black boxes on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. She was very unique, just like herself. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels noted that “Luna was at least as eccentric as I was… perhaps even more so… I love her and will miss her… I hope she’s in a better place now.”
Prior to the 2010 federal election, the proportion of the 1400 people surveyed who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of voters share the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia’s last monarch.
According to the extreme values of the public opinion poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist swimmer was scheduled to compete in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but doubts arose about their fitness due to complaints.
He couldn't get the medications he needed to overcome the pain, as they are prohibited for players.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
Numerous people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, which was then announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the largest deliverers of water to Earth, along with organic materials that form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially the creation of Earth, after comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship at the beginning of the year and signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He/She/It dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
Some say he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It utilizes satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to determine the position of aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport options, trains on the surface will not stop at Wembley, and parking and Park & Ride facilities will not be available.
Fears about potential shipping issues raised the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors, without team fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported on the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported the emergence of a new species, which arose from the interbreeding of the native medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and an introduced species, the large cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris). Although it was previously believed that this process would take much longer, the new species evolved in just under two generations.
Gold can be shaped into any form and worked even in tiny sizes.
It can be drawn into thin, easily twisted and coiled wire. It also allows for forging or rolling into sheets.
It can be shaped very thinly and adheres to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is called chemical pH. An indicator can be made from red cabbage juice.
The color of red cabbage changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons formed by the loss of electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then press them into balls with a clean, wet hand.
The moisture on our hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of drainage systems were found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone on the phone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the broadcast and sends it back to Earth almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use astronomical telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has brought incredible changes to the world. The biggest thing we owe to the wheel is much easier and faster transportation.
This brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are medium-sized cats, which consume medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) also eat considerably more small prey than, for example, insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept, a specific activity that every cat adheres to, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three related males, and up to thirty females and young.
Females generally bond more strongly with each other, being a family with many older sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave surprisingly similarly to wolf or dog packs—animals whose behavior is comparable to that of lions (but not like other big cats)—and are very deadly when it comes to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger is capable of climbing trees (though not very well), swimming, jumping long distances, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger (Genus Panthera) belongs to the same group as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four big cat species are the only ones whose individuals can roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like a lion’s full-throated roar, it’s more like a sentence composed of words snarled out with a grimace.
Ocelots readily consume small animals. If they are able, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds as well. Almost every animal an ocelot hunts is significantly smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots locate their prey by following their scent and sniffing the ground.
They can see very well in the dark, as they have night vision and move stealthily. The marbled cat hunts prey by blending into its surroundings, then pouncing on its victim.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population they originated from (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island and cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than it needed to be before.
The original population has not changed at all; they still require the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it will increasingly differ from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different from each other that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants are capable of producing oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out.
Plants obtain their nourishment from the sun through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants as well. Most of the food we eat is also plant-based. Without plants, animals wouldn't survive either.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except another mosasaurus.
From his long jaws protrude more than seventy razor-sharp teeth, and another row is found on his palate, so nothing escapes that crosses his path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
At the same time, it attacked anything that entered the water; even a dinosaur as large as a T. rex couldn’t reach it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent, the dormouse.
The other difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to host banquets together, where they nibbled and chatted side by side.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the god's home.
People made sacrifices to the gods and their priests, and they tried to satisfy the gods’ needs with rituals and festivals.
Every church had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, known as ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower served as a special sanctuary of the divine.
Due to the warm climate of the Middle East, the house did not hold as much significance.
Much of the life of Hebrew families took place outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the courtyard; the shops were only open stalls facing the street. They used stones to build the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, therefore wood was considered an extremely valuable treasure.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was considered "Scandinavian," the Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and Icelandic people, kings, customs, and histories differed in many respects.
If you’ve seen the movie *The Gold of the Nation*, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words “The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776” were written. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although the identity of its author is uncertain, it is known that shortly after its completion, the large (29 and a quarter inches long and 24 and a half inches wide) parchment document was stored rolled up.
So it's likely the tag was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
This was ruled by the “Vichy” French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies occupied Southern France, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon."
In just under two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is the unique culture that is shared among a larger group of people who live and work together in a society.
The origin of the word "civilization" lies in the Latin words *civilis*, *civis*, and *civitas*, which mean citizen, fellow citizen, and city or city-state, the latter of which also defines the size of a society to a certain extent.
City-states were forerunners of nations. Civilized culture encompasses the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the 13 states first established a weak central government – Congress being its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes and had no national executive or judicial branch, so it often relied on reluctant state authorities to enforce its laws.
He had no authority to overrule tax laws or inter-state customs tariffs either.
Amending the fundamental law required the unanimous consent of all states, but the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives frequently absented themselves from sessions.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, alongside the German national football team, and they won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the clustering/grouping of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical standpoint.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island’s name – Ilha Formosa – meaning Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a foothold in southwestern Taiwan, reformed the indigenous people's grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of western Taiwan and the northern coastal areas, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, granting sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main parts: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the perimeter of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was a defining film size at the twilight of the analog film era.
Its production is still ongoing, but importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35mm format actually represents a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm, which is somewhat confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format can be set to 3:2 (to achieve the simplest whole number ratio after a division by 12).
Numerous common formats (such as the APS format family) match or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and frequently a source of ridicule, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
He claims the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under scrutiny.
The Christian religion bound European states together for more than a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources should specifically serve this purpose.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and seeing this concentration of power and money, many questioned whether it fulfilled its fundamental teachings.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law as codified in multiple international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering vast oceanic areas, thereby endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare as well.
During the 1920s, the dominant behavioral pattern among citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Having experienced the horrors and cruelties caused by World War I, nations will avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a position at Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had nothing with him except a book of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former boss).
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods: each period and each ruling family in Chinese history was a distinct dynasty.
Between individual dynasties, an era of shared provinces and uncertainty prevailed. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, several nobles vying for the throne engaged in fierce battles with each other.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, where thousands perished in the struggle for the highest seat in the Xi’an palace.
The decimal system has a huge number of social and political impacts, representing a shift from absolutism to republicanism, and faith in the nation and its people rather than in a single sovereign ruler.
Following the revolution, occupations became open to all male applicants, thus allowing the most ambitious and successful to rise to the top.
The same applies to the military, as instead of the class determining the army rank, it is now based on merit.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed working-class members in many other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Mohamed showed a deep interest in things beyond the worldly life. He regularly visited a cave located on Mount “Noor” (light), which became known as “Hira”, a place for contemplation.
He himself is the cave that has survived the ages and provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on top of one of the mountains north of Mekka, is completely isolated from the outside world.
Moreover, it’s not easy to find even if one knew of its existence. As soon as we enter the cave, complete isolation sets in.
Nothing else can be seen, only the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. This world is barely visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramids built to honor deceased pharaohs.
On the Giza plateau, or in the “Giza necropolis”, within the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), as well as numerous smaller tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, burial sites, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "pull-up" signal is V-shaped, while the "pull-down" signal looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you need to start at the mountain and draw the bow, down means you need to start at the frog (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A “upstroke” generally produces a softer sound, while a “downstroke” produces a stronger and more defined one.
Feel free to mark your notes in pencil, but please remember that the printed bar lines are there for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
The terrified Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forcibly returned from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a mob comprised of market women and other commoners.
The king and queen traveled back to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a jeering mob shouting threats against them.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
Suddenly, before the frightened queen’s eyes, a member of the crowd shook the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The people of the Philippines paid for the war expenses of US imperialism's conquest of their islands.
To cover the majority of the costs, they had to pay taxes to the American colonial administration, and the bonds ended up with Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits stemmed from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people, and these constituted the fundamental profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, we must understand the circumstances that led to the order's creation.
The period of these events is generally referred to as the Late Middle Ages in European history, encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000 - 1300).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally concludes around 1500.
Technological determinism in practice encompasses broad ideas, but advocating for technology or technological inevitability strictly evokes the sense that human destiny is governed by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path independent of cultural or political influence, and that, conversely, technology has an “impact” on societies, these impacts being inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, there is also the opinion that motor vehicles necessarily lead to road development.
However, the country-wide road network is not economically viable with few cars, so new manufacturing methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership, however, also leads to high numbers of road accidents, which in turn encourages the invention of new techniques in healthcare dedicated to healing injured bodies.
Cultural determinism formed a significant part of Romanticism, and its writers drew inspiration from figures such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and customs and culture developed over time that were tied to a specific geographical location, proving more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws when in harmony with the community’s place.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Its position deteriorated in the 12th century, primarily because the Crusader knights rejected suspicious gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than those offered by Byzantine markets.
During this period, Paris gained the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic style's peak period lasted from the 10th-11th centuries to the 14th century.
The garment was strongly influenced by Byzantine, Eastern culture in its early stages.
However, due to slow communication methods, styles in the West could have lagged behind by as much as 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started fastening their clothes with buttons.
Subsistence agriculture is agricultural activity aimed at producing only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses locally adapted, preserved seeds and crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields within an ecoregion.
Throughout history, most farmers have practiced subsistence agriculture, and this remains true in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of self.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics defining a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical differences, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their affiliation with a recognizable system of symbols, encompassing fashion, behavioral patterns, and the use of slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the few unfortunate examples of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized during their development into adulthood within a community of adults.
Children like these are called feral or unmanageable. Some feral children were isolated by people (often their own parents), sometimes involving abandonment due to parental rejection stemming from the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised among animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If children are raised by non-human animals in the wild, within physical limitations, they will almost entirely adopt the behavioral patterns of the animal raising them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step beyond that.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather assistance that provides support for those engaging in new learning experiences, such as learning to use new software or embarking on a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, the teacher is also a kind of "scaffolding," but so is the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding has been integrated into the software, with the aim of prompting, leadingly questioning, and explaining the processes that would have challenged the student when completing the task independently.
Children are placed in orphanages for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
A child should never be allowed to grow up without a nurturing, caring, and educational environment, yet it still happens.
We consider foster care a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care aims to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and a reliable healthcare system.
Orphanages must provide for all the needs that were lacking in the previous home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to further opportunities from the perspective of the use and satisfaction model.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"“Personal involvement” and “ongoing connections” were also considered new motivational factors in Eighmey and McCord’s (1998) study, which focused on reactions to audience-created web pages."
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, brief facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Especially when they claim that some people can correctly detect when someone is lying based on certain facial expressions.
In his essay, “The President’s Speech,” Oliver Sacks pointed out that people with brain damage who are unable to interpret speech can very accurately perceive sincerity.
He also claims that the ability to interpret human behavior can be found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that genetic variation has two variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation provides opportunities for new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the expressed variation pool.
Mixing segregation and recombination, the back-and-forth variation between the two gene pools in every generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to those of humans to satisfy their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, there are serious consequences if this is not met: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, it wouldn't be surprising if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees do on the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking from a habitual sleep cycle and falling back asleep within a short period (10-60 minutes).
You can achieve this fairly easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock, bringing you to a state of wakefulness without fully waking you up.
If you reset the clock in your sleep, put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is consuming plenty of fluids (especially water and tea, which is a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to urinate during the night.
The degree of inner peace possessed by a person is inversely proportional to the degree of tension between body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vitality. Everyone has the opportunity to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. Only our own tension and negativity can prevent us from reaching this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded with the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and many techniques originating from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is, in principle, very simple. It consists of the path of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and all-encompassing love.
With the help of Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation lies deity yoga. Through the visualization of numerous deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and self-awareness is illuminated.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. At the end of the war, the countries clashed as a result of the differences in their systems, methods, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, with proxy armies clashing in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization through the Romanian bridgehead.
At the same time, these plans were almost overnight declared obsolete when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts, after overrunning eastern Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the work of navies has been to ensure a country is able to move people and goods while hindering the enemy's ability to do the same.
One of the most memorable and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to cross the Atlantic Ocean with people and raw materials to help the English.
At the same time, the German navy attempted to stop this traffic, primarily with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as well, as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for their readily available milk source, as well as for their fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that roamed hillsides or other pastures, often under the supervision of child or adolescent goatherds, similar to more widely known shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
Race tracks were already built in England in the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel-laid planks, they allowed horses to pull loads faster and heavier than on the relatively few, bumpy roads of the era.
The connecting elements were used up fairly quickly to keep the track in place. At the same time, they slowly realized that it would be more effective to place a piece of iron on it.
This became a daily routine, but the iron put more strain on the wagon’s wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known method of transportation was walking. Humans began walking on two legs two million years ago, coinciding with the appearance of Homo Erectus (upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedalism evolved in the Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to somewhat reduce the suffering of the future.
In many cases, this is like treating the symptoms. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It’s quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have grown increasingly larger because of overpopulation and humanity’s luxurious lifestyle.
Following its introduction on July 4th at the Congress, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the print shop of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as “Dunlap prints.”
The document was first read aloud in public by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. The copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap pages, still accounted for today, are considered among the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe nowadays that a group of dinosaurs survived. These are, specifically, the birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they are feathered and capable of flight.
Birds still look quite similar to dinosaurs in many ways.
They have scaled and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Practically every computer used today operates on the principle of processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, which are called binary digits or bits in computer science terminology.
Internal poisoning isn't necessarily immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The surest sign of internal poisoning could be an open container of medication or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label to see if it contains first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bogár" (beetle) officially to refer to this group of insects.
The term originates from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, insects that are exceptionally well-adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both robber bugs and bed bugs are nesters, meaning they are capable of building nests, or they utilize existing structures.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
During adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works using scientific methods. This method is essentially the foundation of most scientific research.
However, it doesn't consist of this alone. Experimentation, and an experiment is a test designed to exclude one or more possible hypotheses, to raise questions and to observe, also aids scientific research.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in every field of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek language proficiency, the West cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observable in physiology and human behavior largely depend, in most cases, on the occurrence and production of endogenous cycles during the biological cycle.
In most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, periodic rhythms can be observed that are not merely reactions to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues free-running cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence supporting the theory that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted in which the phage DNA was labeled with radioactive phosphorus or the phage proteins were labeled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the nature of the mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, while mutations that develop elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in natural sites and enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
The on-site programs include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people commute from small rural towns to get to work, passing by those for whom that town is where they work.
In this dynamic commuter traffic, everyone is somehow connected to everyone else, and supports a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science allows us to conclude that this massive carbon dioxide emission has shifted the biosphere away from the stable state that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone has complaints about them.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints regarding water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they go bankrupt daily? Are logistics engineers simply incompetent? Or is there a fundamental flaw?
Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, as the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally tend to behave within reasonable limits; thus, traffic flows usually have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship was found between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design, and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily, and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantageous trait of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This offers them more places to hide from predators.
Today, only the dragonflies and damselflies can’t fold their hind wings.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite – that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (indeed, all the other stars as well).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth spinning, do you?
The Amazon is the largest and second-longest river on Earth. Its discharge is more than eight times greater than that of the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching 6 miles wide in places.
20 percent of the freshwater flowing into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size of the Giza pyramids or the excellence of their structure.
Ancient Egyptians living during the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments built by their ancestors, which were already well over a millennium old by then.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest and least populous independent country in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language used by the majority of those working in the state, while Latin is used mostly in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People were already familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper in ancient times, as each of these could be found in nature in raw form and was relatively easy to mine even with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he thought these were becoming new materials visible to us.
An alloy is fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. It is worth noting that there are a great number of chemical elements found in the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium, and similar elements are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals as well, such as silver and gold.
Some alloys may contain non-metallic elements in small quantities, such as carbon.
The universe is made of matter. All matter is built up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, it served many people well upon the invention of the pencil.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have developed, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and is used less frequently.
People these days write messages on computer screens and never get near a pencil sharpener.
We can only speculate what the keyboard will be like if they come up with some new development.
A fission bomb operates on the principle that colliding an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's as if we were rolling a heavy car uphill. Re-splitting the atomic nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can split apart spontaneously or with minimal prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
Under lowlands it is thinner, but thicker under plateaus.
It's possible there's more black rock in the nearby area because the crust is thinner. This makes it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what sparks their interest.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during the process of becoming an adult.
These theories investigate what drives certain people to want the things they do, and what in their environment motivates them to do – or not do – those things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can develop when leaders begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is when they try to “remain one of the guys” (or gals).
It is difficult for this type of leader to make unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary proceedings, perform performance evaluations, define areas of responsibility, and hold people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, someone transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels compelled to change everything created by the group and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of their team.
This behavior often creates conflict between leaders and the rest of the group.
The performance indicators of virtual teams are measured by the same standards as those of traditional teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often act as the primary point of contact for their direct physical team counterparts.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones, which local management may not fully understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique characteristic of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the leading team to whom members report. The invisible team sets the standard for its members.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One goal of implementing learning concepts within organizations is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across an organization's functional departments, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, the process of collaboration in overcoming obstacles within the organization has led to a new, innovative process serving to satisfy customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the principle of continuity as a method that can help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports the observations of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and also cause changes in certain cognitive abilities.
The rise of new technologies allows for the observation of brain structures and processes previously never seen before.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material, which allows us to build simulation models to understand the processes taking place in our minds.
Despite its strong science fiction connotations, AI is actually a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence includes the creation of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
For example, management, planning and scheduling, responsiveness to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These kinds of things have become independent fields of study that focus on solving real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as being integrated into numerous home computer and video game software programs.
Class trips are a major part of most classrooms. Teachers often and gladly take their students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology makes virtual field trips possible. Students can view museum artwork, visit an aquarium, or admire any work of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing the experience of a class trip virtually with others is also a great way to reminisce about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, the website is redesigned every year, but they also keep the old versions online in an accessible format as a kind of yearbook.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since the most critical audience often emerges from the ranks of students, the blogger considers developing writing skills crucial to avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging “forces students to better understand the world around them.” Maintaining audience interest encourages students to be thoughtful and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to significantly extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can “prepare students to become more analytical and critical; actively responding to online materials can help students define their position towards the writing of others” and their own viewpoint on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada’s captivating, bilingual capital, boasts numerous art galleries and museums that reveal Canada’s past and present.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, Muskoka with its untapped natural beauty.
These, among many other things, present Ontario to foreigners in a truly Canadian light.
To the north, there are vast, sparsely populated areas and, at times, almost completely uninhabited wildernesses.
A demographic statistic that surprises many: there are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coasts of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and could be considered a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are renowned as coastal luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them to the territories, and it gained significant ground on the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The northern part of the region is bordered by the Sahel, while the Atlantic Ocean borders the western and southern parts.
Women: Female travelers are advised to identify as married, regardless of their marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something they might perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences aside, that's still not acceptable!).
Casablanca, a modern city, was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategically important port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it, then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, while Spanish merchants gave it the name Casablanca and established their trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of trinkets, but everything here is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is necessary to inquire about the situation of ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province before visiting areas outside of Goma.
The town serves as the starting point for climbing the Nyragongo volcano, and is also one of the cheapest places in Africa to observe mountain gorillas.
To get around within Goma, you can use boda-bodas (motorbike taxis). A typical (local) fare for a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
Associated with its relative isolation, it was used as a metaphor to characterize exotic, distant lands – even as “Timbuktu”.
Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although due to its fame it is a tourist attraction and also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of encroaching desert sand.
This was a key stop on Henry Louis Gates’ PBS series, "Wonders of the African World."
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it exudes more of an Arabic vibe than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, and is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe, and to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to unique flora and fauna.
This forms one of South Africa’s main attractions and is considered the flagship of the national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Just like in all South African national parks, a conservation and daily entrance fee must be paid here as well.
It might also be useful to purchase a "Wild Card" card, which allows you entry either to selected South African parks, or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong got its name from Hong Kong Island, and this place is the center of attention for many tourists.
The parade of buildings shaping the silhouette of Hong Kong resembles a glittering column chart, further accentuated by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The urban part of Hong Kong Island is largely concentrated along the north shore on reclaimed land.
This is the place occupied by English colonists, so if you’re looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, extending 80 km inland from the coast into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has become part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests aren’t just mangrove swamps – here you can also find some of the last strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the entire Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², about one-third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
The Sundarbans region has served as a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and is currently estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart all day from the intercity bus station (across the river), but most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since inter-district buses often get full, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and have a large capacity.
A taxi is a quick and comfortable way to visit nearby places – such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque, which belongs to Brazil, with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, which is part of French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two 3.5-meter wide traffic lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs checkpoints are estimated to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group who lived in present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters, and also maintaining subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua tribes, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
16th-century Paraguay, formerly known as “The vast land of the Indians,” came into being as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous peoples.
The Spanish initiated the colonial period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a significant part of its indigenous features and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best water polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition series of the year will be in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
Less prestigious competitions and matches can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
For news about the championships and to purchase tickets for polo matches, please visit the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
Currency exchange is only possible at the single bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West business.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in the surrounding area, and payment can often be made with Stanley cards and US dollars as well.
On the more remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, although British and American currency may still be taken. It’s worth agreeing with the owner in advance what payment methods they accept.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, summer there occurs when winter occurs in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There aren't particularly rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park have become accustomed to encountering people, wildlife is still wild, and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, maintain a distance of at least 100 meters from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, wapiti, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so you must allow them space to move.
In addition, it's important to know that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so be sure not to cook or bring foods with strong odors, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for a single British battleship. Approximately 200 American and German people lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed at a peaceful gathering in the city.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is flanked by two harbours. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean coastline, stretching from North Long Bay all the way to South Devonport.
It is almost safe to swim on all sandy beaches, and most of them offer shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located by the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, where a variety of shops line the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It’s not a complex beer, but it’s pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
You can get a lot of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you’re worried, bottled water is easily available.
The concept of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. They call a short black an 'espresso', pile a lot of cream on top of their cappuccinos (not foam), and serve tea without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian expectations. The fruit juices are expensive, but of excellent quality.
Throughout the year, many visitors come to the reef, and injuries resulting from this are rare.
Despite this, follow the advice of the authorities, obey the instructions on the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish have been appearing near beaches and river mouths since 1770, between October and April. Occasionally, they can be found elsewhere during these times.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and prefer to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides travelers with the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have exclusive deals with certain hotels, although it is possible to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent as well, such as campsites.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and accommodation deals.
They can even hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents required for your destination (such as a visa).
Please send any changes or requests to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At certain music festivals, a significant majority of attendees choose to camp on-site, and indeed, most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Don't forget that even though the concert on the main stage has finished, there may be areas of the festival that continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the cabin’s orientation, as navigating through ice can create terrible noise for those nearby.
Visiting the ring roads of Saint Petersburg is part of sightseeing. Passengers on ships are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos generally make numerous efforts to maximize the time guests spend and the money they lose. Windows and clocks are typically absent, and the exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and encourage them to stay longer.
In certain places, alcoholic beverages are also offered on the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive on them as you would on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, a large amount of snow can fall in a very short time, enough to cause blockages.
Visibility may be limited by snowfall or blizzard conditions, as well as condensation or ice forming on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic flows smoothly throughout the year.
African safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist attractions and offer a remarkable experience for visitors.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to overland journeys aimed at viewing the magnificent wildlife of Africa, particularly on the savanna.
Some animals, such as giraffes and elephants, venture close to the cars, making them easily observable even with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and it’s easier to see them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a bush walk, hiking safari, or foot safari) consists of a hike lasting several hours or multiple days.
The Paralympics will be held between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some competitions will be held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having been the host of the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a strange situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies no longer apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled.
According to expectations, event tickets will generally cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with the typical price of a ticket being around ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes helps with drying. You can find an iron and ironing board in many hotels, even if one isn't in your room.
If you don't have an iron, or don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Caution, do not allow the fabric to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are multiple ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against typical threats.
In some areas, boiling water for just one minute is sufficient, while in others, it requires a longer time to do so.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, consider purchasing water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they may not have encountered at home before.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in more severe cases, allergic reactions, and they can also spread poison or infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the tax- and surcharge-free purchase of products at certain locations.
Travellers to countries with lower taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the biggest driving challenge on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often running through isolated, middle-of-nowhere areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes peeled: steep climbs, narrow lanes, and sharp turns characterize the road.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections—typically 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is particularly important.
It's interesting, however, that the signal strength is much stronger here than on other parts of the route, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German baked goods are very good, they are made quite richly and diversely in Bavaria, in which they resemble their southern neighbours, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are used year-round, while cherries and plums are typically baked into pastries during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The more popular pastries are often a good match with a cup of strong coffee.
If you'd like some small but filling pastries, try what are known as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, made with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be “dry” or “saucy” depending on how much liquid it contains.
In North India and the interior of Pakistan, yogurt is often used, while in South India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used to make curry.
With 17,000 selectable islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a vast variety of cuisines found in the regions of the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term most often refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is widely present, offering a variety of simply seasoned dishes where peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices dominate the flavors of Java.
The stirrups hanging down on either side of the saddle support the rider’s feet.
They offer greater stability for the rider, however, their use raises safety concerns as the rider's foot can get caught.
If a horse throws its rider, but the rider's foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them along if it continues to gallop. To minimize this risk, we can take a number of safety precautions.
First of all, most competitors wear heeled, smooth, narrow-soled riding boots.
Afterwards, some saddles, particularly English saddles, are fitted with safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if the rider is pulled backwards during a fall.
The Cochamó Valley is a prominent mountaineering destination in Chile, known as the “Yosemite of South America,” featuring diverse, massive granite walls and cracks.
Breathtaking views open up from the peaks of the mountains. Climbers arriving from all over the world are constantly creating new routes on the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, encompassing descending snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with a significant fanbase, its enthusiasts are sometimes called "ski lovers," and they plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers can be traced back to as early as 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport date back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backcountry skiing: it is also called ski touring or touring skiing.
It's connected to it, but generally doesn’t involve an Alpine-style ski tour or mountain climb, the latter of which take place on steep terrain and with much stiffer skis and boots.
Interpret the ski route as if it were a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, it will be able to cover a greater distance than by walking – but it will rarely reach the speed necessary for cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling across multiple countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
However, the Schengen Area, in this regard, functions somewhat like a single country.
While remaining in this zone, you generally do not need to pass through further passport control points when crossing borders.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to obtain a separate visa in each Schengen member state, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally defined standard for what manufactured objects qualify as antiques. According to some tax authorities, antiques are objects over 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographical location; in some places, the age limit is shorter than in Europe, such as in North America.
We could define handcrafted products as antiques, even though they are newer than similar, mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding has been an important source of livelihood for the Sami people – and still is today – and the culture surrounding the industry is important to many people engaged in other professions as well.
Even traditionally, not all Sami people participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer mostly as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami area, in the town of Sápmi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you wish to visit is subject to a travel warning, this may affect your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance.
Furthermore, they can also request advice from other governments, but those governments have tailored their advice to their own citizens.
As an example, citizens of Near Eastern countries may receive different treatment from Europeans and Arabs.
Information leaflets are merely brief summaries of a country's political situation.
The presented views are often brief, general, and overly simplified, compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a collective term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or even human fatalities.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it has several types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are manifestations and consequences of extreme weather, alongside thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
We strongly advise travelers to familiarize themselves with the severe weather risks affecting the area, as these may impact their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country designated as a war zone would benefit from undergoing professional training beforehand.
If we search for 'Hostile Environment Course' online, we will likely get the address of a local company.
The course generally covers all the problems discussed here in much greater detail, often combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training as well.
Books and magazines on the theme of wilderness survival are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Passengers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The approach of individual governments differs in whether they are willing to issue a passport where the gender is not indicated (X), or to issue a document containing the new name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is equally variable.
Security checks at checkpoints have become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals facing surgery cannot expect their privacy and dignity to be protected when passing through body scanners.
Rip currents are return flows caused by waves breaking away from the shore, often near a reef or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow becomes compressed in some of the deeper sections, and a swift current can form there in the deep water.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion, when people try to swim against the current, which is almost impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back to shore is no harder than usual.
Try to aim for a spot where the current won't carry you away again, or – depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed – it might be worth waiting for rescue.
Reverse culture shock appears much sooner than culture shock (there's a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For travelers who easily adapt to a new culture, it can sometimes be particularly difficult to readjust to their own, original culture.
Upon returning home after time spent abroad, one adapts to the new culture and abandons some customs from their home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding with you, and aware that travelers visiting an unfamiliar country need time to adjust.
People probably don’t think that returning travelers need patience and understanding.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting sights in the area for children.
We can see the pyramids in the darkness and silence even before the show begins.
Generally, the sounds of tourists and vendors are always audible here. The story told through sound and light is just like one from a fairytale book.
The sphinx provides the backdrop, and it is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by numerous countries and this area has the most bases, of which there were sixteen active bases in 2020.
The island group lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among these are Livingston Island and Deception Island, the latter of which features a spectacular natural harbor formed by the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge with the plateau, then rise again, forming the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif topped by Mount Vinson at 4,892m, is located in the northern part, or the Sentinel Range.
In remote locations where there is no mobile network coverage, a satellite phone may be the only solution.
Satellite phones generally don't replace mobile phones, as a clear line of sight to the satellite is required outdoors to make a call.
The service is frequently used in navigation, including recreational boating, as well as expeditions requiring long-distance communication of data and voice.
Your local phone company may be able to provide you with more information about connecting to the service.
An increasingly popular option is to take a so-called gap year for travel and study.
This is particularly popular among graduating students, allowing them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their studies.
In many cases, a course completed abroad during a gap year can genuinely increase your chances of being accepted into higher education upon returning to your home country.
Participation in these educational programs usually involves tuition fees.
Finland is a wonderful boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also boasts thousands of small islands within the area of lakes and coastal island groups.
In the archipelagoes and on the lakes, a yacht isn't necessarily needed.
Although the island groups along the coast and the largest lakes are large enough for yachting, we can enjoy a different kind of experience with smaller boats or even kayaks.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and every seventh or eighth person owns a boat.
This is the case for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this ratio is one in forty).
Most highlighted Baltic Sea cruises offer a long stop in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a couple of days, spending the night on the boat.
If you only go ashore on excursions from a ship, you won't need a separate visa (since 2009).
In some cruise brochures, Berlin, Germany is also included in the offerings. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea at all, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be frightening for people of any age and background, especially if they haven't flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's no need to be ashamed of this: it's the same as personal fears, or when you don't like something – many people feel this way.
For some, a partial understanding of how aircraft function and the events that occur during flight can help overcome the fear rooted in a lack of knowledge or control.
Courier companies pay well for fast delivery. Time is critical when it comes to business documents, goods, or urgently needed parts for repairs.
Certain routes are served by major companies with their own aircraft, however, other routes and smaller companies have experienced difficulties.
If goods are sent by air freight, on some routes it could take days for the cargo to be unpacked and clear customs.
To ensure faster transit, we checked it as baggage. The airline's regulations don't allow sending a package without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
Flying first or business class is a clear way to flash a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or, even better, get your company to foot the bill for you).
However, this is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay four times the usual fare for business class and eleven times the usual fare for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats between points A and B.
Airlines know there’s a certain group of passengers willing to pay large sums for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a republic comprised of multiple nationalities, and it suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the unilateral proclamation of the Transnistrian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but the country is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between the two parts of Moldova have been restored.
In Moldova, Orthodox Christianity is the main religion.
With a population of approximately 3.7 million, İzmir is Turkey's third largest city, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The former city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide avenues, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, marble statues depicting interesting pigeons can be seen above several graves.
It's worth taking a half-hour stroll through the charming little village.
Sintra, a romantic and stunning town, lies to the north in an easily accessible location, becoming famous among foreigners after Lord Byron’s notes on the town’s splendours.
The number 403 Scotturb bus runs frequently to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, be sure to visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-renowned site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, which holds almost incalculable value for a portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time there, and far more who had loved ones murdered or worked to death there, whether they were Jewish or not.
Please treat this place with the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by drawing graffiti or scratching into the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signage is only in Catalan, as it is the first official language according to the law.
Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Routine announcements on the metro are only available in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced in multiple languages via an automated system, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known as being self-centered, impolite, and arrogant.
While this is often merely an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris still remains to behave as best we can – as someone who is “bien élevé” (well-bred). This will significantly ease our way.
The Parisians' brusque manner quickly disappears if we observe a few basic courtesies.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is a very wooded area, primarily featuring beech, spruce and coniferous trees, as well as a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts a particularly diverse range of plant communities, due to its varied microclimates, different soil types, and varying altitudes.
The area is home to a remarkably diverse range of animal and bird species.
Here, you can find rare wildlife such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and the capercaillie, as well as many other more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you’ll receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Following the same principle, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothing isn't washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, similar to other Mediterranean areas, mainly uses bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and olive oil with everything.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summertime, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and whatever seasonings are available, be it cheese, tuna, or anything else.
All nouns, aside from the "Sie (you)" pronouns, always begin with a capital letter, even mid-sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish certain verbs and their objects.
They claim it makes reading easier, although writing becomes somewhat more complicated, as one has to figure out whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words should be pronounced exactly as they are written.
The capital letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
Furthermore, one must pay attention to the different pronunciations of 'r' and 'rr': 'caro' means expensive, while 'carro' means wagon.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, by reading this grammar foundation, we can learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the expressions.
It goes without saying that someone who knows a Romance language will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
Nevertheless, those people who know a little Spanish quickly jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Observatories prior to modernization are now outdated and are becoming museums or educational venues.
In their heyday, light pollution wasn't as big of a problem, so they are mostly found in cities or university areas, in more accessible locations than their modern counterparts.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities located in isolated areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching the cherry blossoms bloom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were the most beloved flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were hosted by the ruler himself for himself and the aristocratic members of the imperial court.
Plants are most beautiful in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even “just one” specimen.
If they are caught collecting "samples" in a beautifully landscaped garden, they will be thrown out without question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, easy to navigate, and where you can obtain almost anything you need after arriving.
However, as the area slightly north of the equator belongs to the “very hot climate zone”, both the heat (always) and the strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, less frequently) must be taken into account.
There are several buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs – Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob – and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take actually goes into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good theme on which to base our vacation.
For example, a visit to the châteaux of the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or a river cruise along the Danube touching on interesting cities, or perhaps boating along the Erie Canal.
Furthermore, popular hiking and cycling routes are also designated.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, when the birth of Jesus is celebrated.
Many traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by non-religious members of Christian countries as well as by non-Christian countries.
There's a tradition where people spend Easter night awake in some open space to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition as well, but it’s likely that this is a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Holy Saturday night, and congregations often erupt in celebration at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, so the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of people, numerous mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos Islands, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to view the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for most of the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you can also enjoy gazing at the stars.
Japanese work culture is more formal and hierarchical than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Workplace harmony is crucial, therefore it’s important to emphasize collaborative efforts rather than highlighting individual achievements.
Employees must seek approval from their superiors before making any decisions, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
