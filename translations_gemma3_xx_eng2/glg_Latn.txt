It was in late 2017 when Siminoff appeared on the QVC television shopping channel.
Ring also reached an out-of-court settlement with a competing security company, ADT Corporation.
Although indications suggest an experimental vaccine is capable of reducing mortality caused by Ebola, to date, no medication has definitively demonstrated its ability to treat that infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promising results in that field, but other formal studies indicated it offered fewer benefits than expected in preventing mortality.
In the trial against PALM, ZMapp acted as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other medications to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee and acknowledges the urgent need for the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement asserting that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and of their sport, could be better served by looking to the future with a significant change within our organization, rather than withdrawing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could clarify how abuses of the dimensions described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar were able to go unnoticed for so long and welcomes all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same objective: to make gymnastics as a sport, as well as others, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
It was during the 1960s that Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor, and subsequently for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (an already widespread theory) and furthermore provides other data that fossils generally don't offer us, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists state that the animal’s feathers were brownish in color on the upper side and pale or carotenoid-colored underneath.
The discovery also offers a perspective on how feathers evolved in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possess other characteristics typical of feathers (barbs and barbules), researchers have deduced that the rachis likely represents a later evolution than those other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flying, but rather to regulate temperature or as ornamentation. Researchers have suggested that, although it is the fossil of a new dinosaur, the sample exhibits adult plumage and is not down from a young hatchling.
The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a new dinosaur, the sample exhibits adult plumage and is not down from a young hatchling.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at a police station in Gaziantep (Turkey) resulted in two officers dead and more than twenty people injured.

They discovered that the Sun follows the same basic principles as the rest of the stars: it has been proven that the activity of all stars in the system is governed by their luminosity and rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a stellar Rossby number, related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less activity the star will have in relation to magnetic inversions.

The community’s outrage led to the current efforts to draft a policy on the sexual content of the site that hosts millions of open-license media.
The work done was fundamentally theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts attraction on the Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts its attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory posits that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he/she stated that the new variant was "extremely worrying and a cause for alarm, due to its very high mortality rate."
It is possible that some patients contracted the illness in the hospital, in Dr. Moll's opinion, and at least two of them were healthcare workers there.
After a year, an infected person may infect 10 to 15 of their close contacts.
Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group with tuberculosis still appears low: 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at a given time in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been an experience with little technological presence: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed paper ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
Once the poll workers verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
French electoral law codifies the procedure in a very strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no ballots are inside at the start of voting, and also that no envelopes are added, except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attest to every single part of the process. At night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Uka's weapon malfunctioned when aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers from constant pain, was blinded in one eye, lost a section of his skull, and had his face reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave his testimony via video link from a USAF base in his home country.
In addition to the competition on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two other individual races at the championship.
His first event was the slalom, where he received a "Did Not Finish" in his first run. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that competition.
In her other competition, the giant slalom, she finished in 10th place in the seated women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finish of Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the 9th-place finish of Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female sit-ski racers in the group did not finish their runs, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not qualify for the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The deputy chief inspector, Mr. K. Arya, stated: “We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss national woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
The defendants respond to the names of Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki explained that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
Nevertheless, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of murdering his son.
He is currently being held awaiting charges and trial, but any witness testimony could be compromised due to the extensive publication of his image.
This is a common practice in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently and, according to the courts, the publication of the photos was potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that “journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc., of suspects.”
The Crown Office, which generally handles judicial proceedings, told journalists that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment is formalised.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over the borders, which Palestinians insist should be based on the borders prior to the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA accepts maintaining that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial would be closely monitored by guards, during the trial’s supervision and the assessment of its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were contracted, within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association’s game hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage for NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first cull operation were given comprehensive guidelines and safety training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) comprised of nine people.
It is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
Martelly responded to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October with a commission.
Sometimes violent protesters were spurred on by the impossibility of holding elections, some of which had been pending since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod failures due to overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry stated they were aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as “not serious.”
The Ministry responded by describing Apple's postponement of the report as "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management agency stated that no damage was reported in the country.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that no tsunami notifications were registered.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A large number of hostages were rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were initially released, as were the photographers from the Philippines.
Subsequently, the photographers were replaced by an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynecologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began studying premature births in his free time while working at the hospital.
Her research demonstrated that if the hormone were administered, the maturation of the fetus's lungs would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators recovered the two flight recorders—the “black boxes.”
The fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: “Luna was the first Queen of the «Extreme». My first representative. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Something extraordinary, almost like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as strange as mine… perhaps even more… I loved her and will miss her… I hope she’s in a better place.”
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed throughout the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34% of survey participants share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of those consulted believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to problems with his fitness, it's up in the air.
She couldn't take the medication she needs to cope with the pain because it's prohibited in the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date.
Numerous people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, a fact that was made public on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the source of water arriving on Earth, along with organic matter that could create proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a very long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor this year and last month signed a bill into law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is rumored that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than older ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being offered and underground trains will not stop at Wembley; surface parking and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game might have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden have pointed out that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it is thought that this process was prolonged for much longer due to breeding between a Darwin’s finch endemic to Española Island (Geospiza fortis) and a cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be transformed into a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be reduced to a minimum thickness and bonded to other metals. Its thickness could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. An indicator can be created using the juice of a red cabbage.
Cabbage changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean, damp hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture in the hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had cisterns in practically every house, connected to an advanced sanitation system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of drainage systems were found.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, toilets also existed. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, shared equally by men and women.
When calling someone who is thousands of kilometers away, a satellite is being used.
The satellite in space receives the call and then bounces it back, almost immediately.
A rocket launched the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is necessary to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel did for us is offer easier and faster means of transportation.
It gave us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Beneath these, there are more medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat a much larger quantity of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the niche idea—specialized work assigned to each cat that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of the felines and live in large groups, called prides.
Packs are composed of one to three adult males who are related, along with up to thirty females and pups.
Female brown bears are often related to each other, as they typically belong to a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act in a very similar way to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (though not to other big cats) in their behavior and also highly deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can boast (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and strike with a force five times greater than a strong human.
The tiger is included in the same group ("genus panthera") as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the full roar of a lion, but rather a phrase with raspy words in screams.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are considerably smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell, nosing along where they have moved across the ground.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and also move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings before jumping on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originate from (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they previously inhabited.
This new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it needed to be up until now.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still require the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, as the new population begins to adapt to its new surroundings, it also starts to look increasingly different from the rest of the population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have such a different appearance that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that we exhale (that is, release with our breath).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and also make clothes with them. Most of the food we consume is also plant-based. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time and feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw was adorned with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, as well as an extra row on the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing that crossed its path had any escape.
We cannot know for sure, but it’s possible it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it’s even possible it was cannibalistic.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-rex wouldn't be a match for it.
Although most of their food would seem familiar to us, the Romans had a sprinkling of items for strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference lay in the fact that while the poor and women ate seated on chairs, wealthy men preferred to hold banquets together where they could recline on one side while eating.
The meals of ancient Rome could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no coconut, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple which was considered the home of that deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
All temples have an open courtyard and, following that, an inner sanctuary to which only priests have access.
Sometimes special tower-like structures in the form of pyramids, called "ziggurats," were built to be integrated as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses weren't so important.
Most of the life of Hebrew families unfolded outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the region of Canaan there were no significant forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for committing a murder and that, while traveling west, he found a territory to which he gave the name Greenland.
Despite its discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all the countries were considered "Scandinavian", there were many distinctions between the people, kings, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you see the film *The Hunt*, you might think the map of a treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Nevertheless, this is not correct. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, mouth downwards.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that in the early stages of its existence, this document on a large parchment (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was kept rolled up.
Therefore, it is likely that that annotation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained occupied.
It was governed by the France of "Vichy." These were French people who had agreed to peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of confronting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and French liberation forces liberated southern France and were advancing towards the Germans.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a considerable number of people who live and work cooperatively: a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin «civilis», which means civil, relating to the Latin «civis», which means citizen, and «civitas», which means city or city-state, and which also, to some extent, defines the size of a society.
City-states are the ones that give rise to nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is passed on through different generations, a lasting cultural legacy, and considerable dissemination.
Minor civilizations frequently disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and do not come to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first created a weak central government (composed solely of the Congress) under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes and, with no national executive or legislature to enforce all its laws, it depended on state authorities, who frequently refused to cooperate.
He also had no authority to invalidate tax legislation or rates between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, but the states treated the government with such disdain that their representatives were frequently absent.
The Italian team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Some popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern regions, while Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that make it up, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European navigators passing by recorded the island’s name as “ilha Formosa” or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwestern Taiwan, thus initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared the country a province of the Qing empire.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they were originally like.
By 1976, 30% of the restoration of Machu Picchu had already been completed, and it continues to this day.
For example, the most common fixed-image photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It still occurs today, but more importantly is the aspect ratio relationship inherited from the formats of image sensors in digital cameras.
The 35mm format, in fact and to add to the confusion, measures 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Thus, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (when dividing by twelve, the simplest whole number ratio is obtained) is 3:2.
Different common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The excessively used and often ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
It establishes that the most effective position for the main subject is found at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For thousands of years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in languages and customs.
Their dominant power in all areas affected the whole world, from the king to the commoner.
One of the fundamental principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s monetary funds exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was Rome for a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this pillar was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital civilian and military supplies, although this blockade violated international law as generally accepted and codified by numerous international agreements over the past two decades.
Great Britain seeded international waters with mines to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, even endangering neutral vessels.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horror and atrocities committed during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America where he accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his last employer’s manager) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique method for showing different time periods; each era of China or each family that came to power was a particular dynasty.
Likewise, between each of the dynasties there was a period of instability with the division of the provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods of time, a bloody war broke out between different nobles who were trying to gain the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political consequences; for example, the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Similarly, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and determined to achieve success.
The same happens with the military, because army ranks, instead of being based on class, came to be based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a great interest in questions related to the afterlife. He would frequently go to a cave that became known as "Hirana" on Mount "Noor" (light) to engage in contemplation.
That very grave, which has survived the passage of time, provides an intense image of Mahoma’s spiritual tendencies.
Located on one of the mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy at all to discover if one even knew it existed. Inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing can be seen but the beautiful clear sky above the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor the death of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the “Giza Necropolis” in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, while a large number of the other, smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu’s wives and family.
The mark for “upward arc” resembles a V and the one for “downward arc” looks like a staple or a square missing its lower half.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, while down means you should start at the heel (where the hand holds the bow) and pull from the bow.
The upward movement of the bow typically produces a softer sound, while the downward movement is more intense and assertive.
You can write your own notations, but don't forget that the printed markings of the bow are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, age 11, and Louis Charles, age 4), as well as the king’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and issuing threats against the king and queen.
The heat forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At a given moment, a member of the mob cleaved the head of a slain royal guard in Versailles before a terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were obligated to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to finance most of the expenses and the interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extraordinary benefits resulting from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the order’s creation.
The era in which those events occurred is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000 to 1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological drive or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is propelled by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
A large part of interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has “effects” on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that motor vehicles contribute to the development of roads.
However, a network of national roads is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are designed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of vehicles also generates a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture emerged related to that geographical context, which, by being in harmony with the place of that society, proved better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a cradle of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its prestige declined during the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned bringing gifts, such as silk and spices which were more valued than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this period that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Nevertheless, as a result of the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could lag between 25 and 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the era, a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is carried out to produce enough food solely to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, typically organic, that uses locally saved native seeds from that eco-region combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and it is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures group together individuals with similar mindsets who feel ignored by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive by the age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine the differences of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of all these factors.
Members of a subculture frequently make their affiliation evident through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to make use of the few unfortunate cases of children who, through abandonment, misfortune, or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
These birds of prey are called “feral” or wild. Some wild birds of prey have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these birds is due to the parents’ rejection of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that feral children experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived solitary lives away from civilization.
When raised by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely identical to those of the particular animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the statistic goes a step further.
Tutoring is not a learning method, but rather support that provides assistance to individuals who are undertaking a new learning experience, such as using new computer software, or starting a new project.
Statuses can be both virtual and real, meaning the teacher is a form of status, but so is the paperclip-shaped character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are built into the software and their purpose is to question, provoke, and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to tackle on their own.
Children enter care for a wide range of different reasons, which can range from abandonment and abuse to neglect.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that isn't enriching, affectionate, and educational, but it happens.
We perceived the non-adoptive foster care system as a safe haven for that girl.
It is taken for granted that our non-adoption foster care system provides safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care adoption is assumed to provide all the needs lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The particular characteristics of the Internet led to additional dimensions regarding the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivating aspects when they researched public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to fundamental discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting just milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect when a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," explained how people who lack the ability to comprehend speech as a result of brain damage are nevertheless able to determine sincerity accurately.
It was even suggested that these skills in interpreting human behavior could be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research conducted in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection eliminates it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variations up and down between both reserves in each generation.
On the savanna, it is complicated for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the existing plants.
Furthermore, not doing so has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large volume of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way relatively similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep shortly afterward (between 10 and 60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock that helps you return to consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself repeatedly dismissing your alarm without waking up, you can put it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get up and turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present will be. All people have the potential to find peace and absolute fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve a state of enlightenment. The only obstacle standing between us and this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism stems from the teachings of the Buddha, but these were expanded through the Mahayana path of love, as well as many techniques of Indian yoga.
To begin with, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the yoga deity. Through visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are reactivated, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes between systems, processes, and cultures led to disagreement between the countries.
After two years since the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the following forty years and was, in reality, fought—through representative armies—on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and other diverse locations.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize on the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, those plans became obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between Russia and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transport of goods is, by far, the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and cargo across the ocean.
The function of the navy has traditionally been to ensure the country maintains the ability to transport people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move theirs.
One of the most recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, was trying to stop that traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain in the same way it had conquered the rest of Europe.
It is believed that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to gain easy access to milk, fur, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were frequently captives or adolescents, in a manner similar to more commonly known shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
"Waggonways" (horse-drawn carts on rails) were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the tracks for wagons (“waggonways”) consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to haul them to achieve higher speeds and move heavier loads along the slightly more rudimentary roads of the time.
The traverses were introduced very early to secure the rails in position. However, gradually, it became evident that the rails would be much more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known method of transport was walking; humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of *Homo erectus* (which means “upright man”).
His predecessor, *Australopithecus*, did not walk upright as is customary.
Evidence of bipedal specialization is found in the fossils of australopithecines dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although it’s possible that Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more respectful way with the environment, we can join an environmental defense movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it equates to a treatment of the symptoms. However, if we don't want a solution that is purely temporary, we should seek the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is more than evident that the world has changed considerably as a result of humanity’s scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a couple of streets away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
On that very night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another additional copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 known Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of that document. The original manuscript document has not survived.
Different paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. They are called birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and could fly.
These birds exhibit many characteristics still very similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs just like a T-rex.
All computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
It is possible that internal poisoning does not become immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so generic that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household substances.
Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from the classic familiarity with bedbugs, insects with a great ability to adapt to parasitizing humans.
Both lice and bedbugs are nesters, they are adapted to live in their own nest or that of their host.
In the United States of America as a whole, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the neurological disease with the highest incidence among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research found that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or in the child's best interest.
These couples can choose to develop an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to determine how the world works through scientific methods. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
It is not solely through experimentation, but rather the experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, posing questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinion was accepted in all matters relating to science, including psychology.
As the wisdom of the Greeks declined, the West detached itself from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior frequently have a vital dependence on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
There are documented periodic rhythms, which are nothing more than responses to periodic external cues, in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a period of free-running operation even in the absence of external cues.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was one that led to the suggestion that DNA constitutes genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They carried out two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have multiple different effects depending on their type, the relevance of the compromised genetic material, and whether the affected cells are of the germline.
Only mutations in germline cells are capable of being passed on to offspring, while mutations in other areas can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural spaces to enjoy the landscape, as well as the fauna and flora.
Examples of “in situ” activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural villages by car to go to their workplace, crossing paths with others whose work destination is the same place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport service, everyone is in some way connected and supports the transport system based on private vehicles.
Current science shows that this massive economy dependent on coal has altered the biosphere from one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
We all participate in society and use means of transport. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, a similar level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges is rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems generate this type of complaints? Why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there some other, more fundamental problem?
The study of traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and private vehicles from one point to another, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent margins; therefore, traffic flows usually have a reasonable consistency and an approximate mathematical representation can be made.
To achieve a better representation of traffic flow, relationships were established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan and design the operations of traffic services.
Insects were the first to fly. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This offered them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought I was right, but many others thought the opposite; the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems logical, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and most voluminous river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles.
20% of the total freshwater from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the continued construction of stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, none ever surpassed those of Giza in either size or the technical superiority of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humanity has known the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since antiquity, as they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized about the principle that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but the theory was also formulated that they transform into new substances that shape what we see.
Alloys are, basically, a mixture of two or more materials. It should not be forgotten that the periodic table includes many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people at the time of its invention.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to inferior status and uses.
Now people write messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new replaces it.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to dragging a heavy car uphill. When the nucleus splits again, it then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of approximately 70 km in the nearest area and 100 km in the furthest.
It is finer beneath the marine areas and thicker beneath the highlands.
It’s possible there’s more maria on the closer side, because the bark is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories about content focus on investigating what motivates people or what they find appealing.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized as they matured and became adults.
These theories study what makes certain people want certain things and what things in their environment will lead them to perform or not perform certain actions.
Two popular theories about the content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behaviors can occur when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one extreme, they will try to continue being “one of the guys” (or gals).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the coin, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who believes they must change everything the team has done and adopt it as their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior frequently creates divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams respond to the same levels of excellence as traditional teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which national management may not understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) also constitutes a unique component of virtual teams.
The “invisible team” is the management group to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the slow process of establishing one that fosters learning? One of the objectives of putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new process of innovation that responds to customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as share knowledge and learning as an organization.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offers physical evidence for the theoretical approach in cognition research. Thus, it reduces the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The expansion of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This offers a great amount of information and material that allows us to build simulation models to help us understand the process in our mind.
Although AI has strong shades of science fiction, it constitutes an important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence seeks to have machines automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to patient diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
These kinds of things have evolved into independent disciplines, which aim to provide solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they have been integrated into multiple domestic software applications and video games.
Field trips are a very important part of any classroom. Teachers often would love to take their students to places that are not feasible to reach by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual school trips. Students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while seated at their desks.
Sharing a school trip virtually can also be a great way to reflect on the trip and shared experiences with other classrooms in the future.
For example, each year the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website is redesigned, but previous versions are saved online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their experiences with blogs demonstrating poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally causes them to improve.
When facing students, who are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, maintaining a blog "obliges students to learn more about the world around them." The need to fuel public interest inspires students to demonstrate their intelligence and be engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “allows students to be empowered to have a more analytical and critical spirit; by offering an active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of what others have written, as well as define their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the lovely bilingual capital of Canada that boasts a selection of art galleries and museums where you can contemplate the country’s past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and many more make Ontario an example of what foreigners consider intrinsically Canadian.
Large areas facing north are only sparsely populated and many are practically uninhabited wilderness areas.
Here’s a comparison about populations that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, without a doubt, the largest and a continent in its own right regarding flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are famous for being luxury beach vacation destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, where it took deep root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
North Pole, the region borders the Sahel and, to the south and west, with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Women traveling here are advised to state they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It might also be useful to bring a wedding ring (that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences could lead to something they would consider harassment, and it’s common for them to be pursued, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to assert your position (whether due to cultural differences or not, it's not acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sailors in the 10th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as a White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Badya, but the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, “hookahs” and a wide range of trinkets, but all of this aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the easternmost part, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, and most of the city's streets, particularly in the centre, were buried.
Even though Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be investigated to ascertain the state of the ongoing conflict that still persists in the North Kivu province.
Similarly, the city is the base from which you can ascend to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
To get around Goma, boda-bodas (mototaxis) can be used. The normal (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for that short journey.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, the term Timbuktu in English has become a metaphor for exotic and remote places.
Currently, Timbuktu is a very poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It featured as one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates’s PBS special about the Wonders of the African World.
The city offers a stark contrast with the rest of those in the country, due to its more Arabic than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each maintaining different fauna and flora.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like in other South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
It is likely that purchasing a Wild Card would also be beneficial, as it offers access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa’s National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the entire territory and is the place many tourists consider most important.
The skyline of buildings in Hong Kong was likened to a brilliant bar graph, made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best panoramic views of Hong Kong, you’ll have to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea on the north shore.
The British colonizers adopted this place as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial history of the territory, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not simply mangrove swamps: they include some of the last strongholds of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganxeta plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 chitals in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (crossing the river) continuously throughout the day, but most, particularly those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
As buses between districts tend to be crowded, it is recommended to buy the ticket in advance.
Most districts have the small Japanese Coaster buses, comfortable and sturdy vehicles.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers reach a height of 83 meters, the bridge measures 378 meters in length and has two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs controls are predicted to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now known as eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the guaycurú and payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the giant province of the Indies," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous natives.
The period of colonization initiated by the Spanish lasted three centuries.
From the moment of Asunción’s founding in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to maintain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here too, smaller tournaments and matches can be witnessed during other times of the year.
To obtain information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, you can contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
The pound sterling is generally accepted on all the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted in Stanley itself.
On those islands on the periphery, credit cards are likely not accepted, although British and American currency will be; you should consult with the owners in advance to determine the most acceptable method of payment.
It is practically impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to make the exchange before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively mild: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to create a feeling of coldness greater than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, it is in any case wild fauna that should not be fed or bothered.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a minimum distance of 100 meters from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, bears, and practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries from not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they should be given space.
Furthermore, it should be kept in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site where the infamous naval confrontation took place in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the U.S., and Great Britain refused to abandon it.
All the ships sank, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, a peaceful demonstration in the city ended with the assassination of supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to the fact that Auckland is situated between two harbors, it has many beaches. The most popular are spread across three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are all safe beaches for swimming and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Bay, in the upscale residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are usually very crowded family beaches with a good variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most famous local beer is "Number One"; it’s not a complex beer, but it’s pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many types of French wine to choose from, but New Zealand and Australian wines probably travel better.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you have any doubts.
For Australians, the idea of a coffee "with milk" is foreign. A coffee is simply an "espresso," a cappuccino has a layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate lives up to Belgian expectations. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips to the reef are organized, and injuries caused by these trips on the reefs are uncommon.
Nevertheless, one must follow the advice of the authorities, comply with the instructions on signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries between October and April north of 1770. They may occasionally be found outside of that period.
Sharks exist; however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and would escape by swimming away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their primary habitat is found in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance offers peace of mind to the traveler, knowing they will have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to or from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
You can also hold the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or search for other documents for the destination (for example, visas).
However, any modification or request must be processed initially through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees decide to camp within the festival grounds, and most of them consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
To be closer to the action, it will be necessary to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
It shouldn't be forgotten that even though the music may end on the main stages, there could be sections of the festival that continue to play music well into the early hours of the morning.
Some festivals have dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the northern Baltic Sea during winter, you should check the location of your cabin, as passage through the ice generates an extremely unpleasant noise that affects some people more than others.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from needing a visa (conditions apply).
Casinos usually make a great effort to maximize the time and money guests spend. There are often no windows or clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
They often have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay on the premises.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered for free. However, intoxication clouds judgment, and all good players are aware of the importance of remaining sober.
People who plan to drive at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, friction is low, so you can't drive the same way you would on normal asphalt.
During a blizzard in a very short space of time, enough snow can fall to become trapped.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowfall or sleet, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries and traffic continues with practically no interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest attraction for tourism in Africa and the most outstanding for many visitors.
The term "safari" is popularly used to refer to overland trips to see the impressive African fauna, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, get very close to cars, so a normal lens will allow you to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so the best way to see them is with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a “mountain walk,” “hiking safari,” or “footing”) consists of hiking, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics would be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some of the events would be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
The flights and accommodation for 2020 were booked before the postponement announcement, it’s possible the situation will become complicated.
Cancellation policies vary, but from late March onwards, most cancellations due to coronavirus will not extend beyond July 2020, the scheduled date for the Olympics.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between 2500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with the average ticket price around 7000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for use, even if they are not in the room itself.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't feel like ironing your socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Do not let the material overheat (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of them more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water is sufficient for a minute, in others you need to do it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so in case of doubt, you should consider buying bottled water sealed by a reputable company.
It is possible that travelers may encounter animal pests with which they are unfamiliar in their regions of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or, in the worst cases, provoke allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals with the capacity to injure or kill people using force, are generally not considered plagues.
Shopping at Duty Free is an opportunity to acquire tax- and consumption tax-free items in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes sometimes can save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often runs through remote terrain in the middle of nowhere.
If you are not used to driving on secondary roads, stay calm: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and tight bends are common.
The speed limits indicated are considerably lower than those in previous and subsequent sections (generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)), and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Nevertheless, it's curious that mobile phone service has better coverage here than in other sections of the route, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and, in Bavaria, they are quite sweet and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbors: Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apples cooked in the pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German bakery products also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of dried fruits. Popular cookies often pair perfectly with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to try some hard, dense pastries, try the one that, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used to cook curry; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian gastronomy is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of dishes found throughout the country.
Nevertheless, used without any other qualifier, the term usually refers to the typical food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently easily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a range of dishes with simple seasonings, with the predominant flavors favored by Javanese people being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang downwards on each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but they can present safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse and their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, they could be dragged along by the horse if it bolts. To minimize this risk, there are a number of safety precautions that can be taken.
First of all, most drivers wear boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Afterwards, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards in the event of the rider falling.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's main destination for rock climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks have impressive views of the mountains. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes between their walls of infinite potential.
Alpine snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular and involve sliding downhill across snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity, with many followers, occasionally referred to as “ski bums,” who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old: paintings in caves depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski hiking.
It is related, although it doesn't usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, since the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much harder skis and boots.
The ski route should be considered similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, it will be possible to cover slightly longer distances than on foot, but skiing speeds will only be occasionally reached without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would mean having to apply for different visas and go through multiple passport controls.
Nevertheless, the Schengen area in that sense functions to a certain extent as a single country.
Whenever you remain in this area, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you don't need to apply for visas separately for each country within the Schengen agreement, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition to determine which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the limit of antiquity may be lower in places like North America than it would be in Europe.
Handicraft products could be defined as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding its trade is also important for many other professions.
However, traditionally, not all Sámi engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, keeping reindeer primarily as draught animals.
Currently, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism constitutes an important income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although its use is very widespread, especially among non-Romani people, the word "gitano" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of that people.
If safety recommendations are issued for the country you are travelling to, your health or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
Perhaps you might want to consult the advice of governments besides that of your own country, but their advice is directed towards their citizens.
For example, it is possible that American citizens in the Middle East will face situations different from those that Europeans or Arabs might experience.
Alerts are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The views presented are generally superficial, broad, and excessively simplified in comparison with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions is a generic term for any type of dangerous atmospheric phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types, which will depend on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Gusts of wind, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of extreme weather conditions, just like spouts, tornadoes, waterspouts and cyclones.
Some severe regional and seasonal atmospheric phenomena include squalls, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to inquire about any severe adverse weather conditions that may affect their area, as this could influence their travel plans.
Anyone considering visiting a country considered potentially a conflict zone should obtain professional training.
An internet search for a “Hostess Training Course” will likely find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues we've been discussing here in more detail, usually with practical activities.
A course will typically last between 2 and 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aid exercises, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications that talk about war zones are less so.
Travellers who are planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents to return.
The willingness of governments when issuing passports without indicating sex (X) or updated documents to reflect a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with those documents also varies considerably.
Pat-downs at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive following September 11, 2001.
Transgender people pre-surgery will not be required to go through scanners to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the flow that returns from waves after breaking against the beach, generally against a reef or similar.
Due to the topology of the groundwater, return flow concentrates in a few deeper sections and it is possible that a rapid current forms towards the deep waters from that point.
Most deaths occur from the exhaustion of trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, returning to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
It should be attempted again in an area where there is no possibility of getting trapped, or, depending on swimming ability and whether it has already been sighted, wait to be rescued.
The shock of return happens before culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their culture of origin.
Upon returning home after living abroad, one has already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of their own.
When he/she traveled abroad for the first time, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
It is possible that people foresee that patience and understanding are also needed with travelers returning home.
The light and sound show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for young people.
The pyramids can be observed in the darkness and contemplated in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a fairytale.
The sphinx appears as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, all of which remain illuminated.
Many countries claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819. These islands host the largest number of bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston and Deception Islands, where the water-filled caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge with the plain, only to re-emerge and form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, including Mount Vinson in the Vinson Range, which reaches 4,892 m.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone is likely to be the only viable option.
Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for mobile phones, as you need to be outdoors with a direct line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
This service is frequently used for making shipments, including leisure boats, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice capabilities.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to offer more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those considering a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among those finishing school, as it allows them to take a gap year before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can, in fact, improve the chances of accessing higher education in one's home country.
Generally, a fee applies to enroll in those educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" also boasts thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are undoubtedly large enough for any type of yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak allow you to enjoy a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but overall it remains quite exceptional (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg (Russia).
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only plan to go ashore with ship excursions, you will not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin (Germany) in their brochures. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and visits to the city are not included in the cost of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s no different from the fears and dislikes people have about other things.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight could help them overcome the fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies receive good payment for delivering items quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies this posed a problem.
Things were sent by airmail, and it was possible that on certain routes it would take several days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there sooner was to send it as checked baggage. But airline regulations prohibit sending baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
An obvious way to fly in first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, to have your company pay).
Nevertheless, it’s not cheap: as a rough estimate, you could end up paying four times the normal business class fare, and even eleven times the first class fare!
Generally, it’s not worth looking for discounts on business or first-class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know perfectly well that there is an exclusive group of passengers who are willing to pay exorbitant prices for the privilege of reaching their destination quickly and comfortably, with the corresponding surcharge.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered due to ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in western Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties were re-established between those two parts of Moldova despite the failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, featuring the second most important port after Istanbul and an excellent transportation hub.
In the ancient city of Smyrna, there is now a modern, extensive, and bustling shopping center, framed by the outline of a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, buildings with glass and modern shopping centers blend with traditional red slate roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, despite the city having an atmosphere more akin to the Mediterranean Europe than to traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one can observe interesting marble sculptures of doves on the tombstones.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk through such an intriguing town.
To the north and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became popular among foreigners after Lord Byron’s laudatory description of its wonders.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, you should visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (sepulcher), a world-renowned center of worship for the apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave, as well as a place that holds immeasurable significance for a huge proportion of the world’s population.
Many men and women still live who survived their time there, and many more whose loved ones were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
This place must be treated with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Making jokes about the Holocaust and the Nazis is prohibited.
It is forbidden to damage the surroundings with markings or painted scratches on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Nearly half prefer to speak Catalan, which most people understand, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
Nevertheless, most signs are written exclusively in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
Normal metro announcements are made solely in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced via an automated system in a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although often treated as an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris remains maintaining good manners and acting like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-bred). This will make getting around the city considerably easier.
The Parisians’ rough exterior will quickly vanish if basic courtesy is shown to them.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has a dense forest mass, primarily of beeches, different types of spruces, such as fir and false fir, and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a considerably wide variety of plant communities, due to its extensive range of microclimates, different soils and variety of altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animals and bird species.
Here you can find exotic fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, deer, lynx, wildcats, and European pine martens, as well as many other common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that reach the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer cloths for women who do not come prepared, but if you bring your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the pile at the entrance, but that clothing isn’t washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all for men!
Mallorcan gastronomy, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (particularly pork) and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple, popular dish, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available seasoning, for example, cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, with the word "Sie" which means "you," are always written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It constitutes a meaningful way to differentiate between some verbs and objects.
In theory, it facilitates reading, although writing is, to a certain extent, complicated by the need to decide whether a verb or an adjective is being used as a noun.
The pronunciation of Italian is quite easy since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
You should also make sure to differentiate the pronunciation of the 'r' and 'rr': *caro* means dear, while *carro* means an animal-drawn vehicle.
The Persian language has a considerably simple and quite regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar could help you learn a lot about Persian and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that if you already speak a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
Nevertheless, people who know some Spanish might jump to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is similar enough not to require studying it separately.
Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today and are preserved as museums or educational centers.
Although in its heyday light pollution wasn't the problem it is today, they are usually found in cities or campuses, which were much easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes consist of gigantic facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Contemplating the blossoming of cherry trees, known as "hanami", has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept was a Chinese vineyard where plum blossoms were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing festivals were celebrated by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants are more beautiful when found in their natural environment, so the temptation to pick even "a single" specimen should be resisted.
When visiting a garden with a formal design, collecting “samples” will result in immediate expulsion, no discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit where it is very easy to get around; you can also buy practically anything once you are there.
Nevertheless, being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the Equator, you will need to adapt to both the heat (constant) and the intense sun (when the sky is clear, which is less common).
There are also some buses heading north towards Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you are thinking of taking goes to Hebron and not simply to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good topic on which to base a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or taking a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also design routes for popular hiking or cycling excursions.
Christmas is one of the most important celebrations of Christianity, commemorating the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this celebration have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night in vigil in an open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is likely that it is a pre-Christian ritual to exalt spring and fertility.
The most traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, after which congregations typically break into celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally reached the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, so the giant tortoise became the first grazing animal in the Galápagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, that is, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents an excellent opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark practically 24 hours a day.
Since those areas are scarcely populated and light pollution, consequently, does not tend to be a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or job title.
Enjoying harmony in the workplace is fundamental, emphasizing the group's effort rather than boasting about individual achievements.
Frequently, workers must obtain approval from their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to follow their instructions without objection.
