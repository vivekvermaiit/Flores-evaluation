The repetition/elongation of the 'ch' sound is typical in colloquial Kashmiri for emphasis. * **مركذيتس (markazitas):** Central (referring to the government). * **وؤت (vut):** And. * **ساس (sas):** Schemes, plans. * **ؤری (vuri):** Numerous, many. * **رؤمس (raumis):** Since (time marker). * **منذی (mandi):** Independence. * **پنس (pans):** Despite, even with. * **تی (ti):** This/the. * **پاور (pavar):** Question, issue. * **يكسےجای (yeksayjay):** Unemployment. * **روذنٕ (rudzan):** Remains, is still. * **سٕتۍ (sati):** Significant, important. * **وتھ (vath):** Is. * **سوال (suaal):** Question. * **زِ (zi):** Of. * **اسؤل (usool):** Problem. * **اؤساوننہ (osaavannah):** Remains (another way of saying "rudzan") * **اؤمت (aumat):** Is. It’s important to note that Kashmiri is often spoken with nuance and implication, so a direct word-for-word translation would sound very awkward. This version aims to capture the *meaning* of the sentence in fluent English.

The "s" indicates possession, meaning "of the British." * **مدد کرنہٕ (madad karan):** “Assistance” or “helping”. * **خٲطرٕہ (khatera):** “Danger” or “risk”. * **نفر تہٕ سامان (nafar tah samān):** "Men and supplies." * **اپور (upur):** "Across". * **منتقل کرٕنچ (muntqal karanich):** "To transport". * **کُوشش کران (koshish karan):** "Were making efforts". **Important Notes:** * Kashmiri often relies on context, and some words have nuanced meanings.
