However, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of their team.
That's roughly equivalent to: **Actually, the main driver of the train is between the leader and other team members.** (A more literal, though less natural, rendering would be: "Truly, always the driver/operator is positioned between the leader and other team members.")

The virtual team members serve as a bridge for the direct physical teams.
Recently, they’ve been discussing a traditional concept regarding the time zone for the wedding, involving the bride and other members. Usually, she is tasked with handling the local management.
The presence, in essence, of the “invisible team” (Larson and La Castleo 1989, P109) is what constitutes a unique component of a virtual team.
That "invisible team" is actually a management team whose duty is to report the performance of its members. That invisible team also establishes standards for the performance of its members.
How does an organization become a learning organization and master its processes? One key characteristic of an organization is its ability to adopt the concept of learning, namely innovation.
