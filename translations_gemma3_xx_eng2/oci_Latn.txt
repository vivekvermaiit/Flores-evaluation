This confirms not only the fact that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but also provides us with details that fossils generally cannot give, such as their colors and their three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides a first glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers did not have a very developed rachis, but instead had other feather structures – barbules and barbicels – researchers deduced that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than those other structures.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggested that, even though it’s the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not that of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the scale shows adult plumage and not chick down.
A vehicle that exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

They found that the Sun functioned according to the same basic principles as the other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was conditioned by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is linked to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is compared to magnetic inversions.

The work done was essentially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the force of the tides between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way similarly exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a halo around the galaxy, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
During an interview, he stated that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, thinks Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers.
For a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
Fortunately, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire group of people who have tuberculosis still seems low: 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations between night and day likely indicate caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding environment during the day and warmer at night.
“The thermal behavior is not as constant as in the large caves of the Earth which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep clots in the ground,” said Glen Cushing, from the astrogeology team of the American Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed paper indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After verification by the polling officials of the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes were added except those of duly counted and authorized electors.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the proceedings. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

His first race was the slalom, where he achieved a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 of the 116 competitors obtained the same result in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the one who finished in first place, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the one who finished in ninth place, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers from the group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The deputy general inspector D K Arya stated, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are identified by the names of Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
And even though several people were inside the house when the vehicle hit it, none of them were injured.
Unfortunately, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of the murder of his son.
She is being held awaiting her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be compromised by the fact that her image has been widely published.
It is a common practice elsewhere, but in the United Kingdom, Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes, "Journalists seem to be truly walking on a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Public Prosecutor's Office, which usually deals with legal proceedings, has informed journalists that no further comment will be made at least until an indictment is issued.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on those existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that would have been discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while an agreement will be signed, whereas the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters of the supplementary control sample of needy populations were to be closely monitored by the guards, given that the sample was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the framework of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are being recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's game hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage of the park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore an oath before a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It's the fifth CEP from Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the former CEO as part of a package of measures that will lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread demonstrations opposing the regime that began in October.
The outbreaks of violence that have occurred were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due since 2011.
Here's the translation of the Occitan sentence to English: Approximately 60 cases of overheating of dysfunctional iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said he had been informed of 27 accidents linked to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company has described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by describing Apple's report delay as "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT on Friday).
The emergency management bureau of the Northern Marianas Islands declared that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Various hostages have been rescued, and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released today, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the town hall. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he began to study premature labor in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung development of the newborn.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, 'black boxes', on Wednesday.
The working colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna crossed the night of the two moons. She is truly unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as troubled as I was... perhaps even more so... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she finds a better place."
Of the 1400 people who were surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those within the survey share this viewpoint, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of them believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle categories and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his injuries, his physical condition has been questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to alleviate his pain because they were prohibited during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25th.
Various people verified the discovery by using computer equipment and software from the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could possibly have been the source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor at the beginning of the year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political blah blah and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run as president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology in opposition to older technology based on ground radars to allow air traffic controllers to determine an aircraft’s position with greater accuracy and give pilots more precise information.
No additional transport is arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable on the ground.
The fear of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that he would be forced to play the match behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was thought that this process took much longer, due to reproduction between a Darwin's finch native to the island, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch immigrant, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked to create all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled very thinly into small forms.
It can be drawn to become a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and inlaid into another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the illustrations hand-painted in books known as "illuminated manuscripts".
It is a chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage indicator changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (base) of the chemical product.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical product being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry flours together, then, with clean, damp hands, knead them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give you a strange sensation and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in common running water in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of plumbing systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also public toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes a part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and then reflects it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It requires a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster means of transport.
It carried us by train, car, and many other means of transport.
They are felines of medium size that eat prey of medium size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, they maintain healthy small populations (including stray domestic cats) that eat plants and many more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and which prevents them from being in competition with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, who live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides are composed of one to three adult males from the same family, together with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely connected to one another, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
Well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and exert a pull five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase of growled and howled words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by their scent, tracking where they have passed on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (as can happen with a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and rivals, therefore the new population will need different strategies or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed to be before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over a long time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will seem so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants draw their nourishment from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. The majority of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most important predator of its time, and therefore was afraid of nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 teeth, sharp as a razor, together with a supplementary row in the roof of its mouth, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but there may have been a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it’s possible it was also a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; and even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex wouldn't have been a match for him.
And even if the larger part of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebratory elements, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of mixed sounding pastry.
Another difference was that in those days the poor and women ate their food while seated on chairs, while rich men liked to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating lavish meals.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no millet, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted a peach.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple, which was considered as the god’s house.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods’ needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard of the temple open and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes there were special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, which were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn’t so important.
The majority of the Jewish family’s life unfolded outdoors.
The women were doing the cooking in the courtyard; the shops were nothing more than workshops open onto the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no important forests in the land of Canaan, and therefore wood was extremely expensive there.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. Nordic sagas recount that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even beyond his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
And even if each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the film National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it’s not true. And even if it has something written on the back of the document, it’s not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, on the reverse side.
And even if no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its life, this document and large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
And therefore, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings, and the subsequent battles, had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French of "Vichy." They were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fight them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France; the invasion was codenamed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large and significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, a relative of the Latin *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas*, which means town or city-state, and which also defines in a certain way the dimension of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a persistent cultural weight, and an equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government—whose Congress was its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and, because it had no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to implement all its decisions.
He had no authority to override fiscal laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, from a geographic point of view, an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in local grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal regions of western and northern Taiwan and declared that Taiwan was a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
The vast majority of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been refurbished to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Around 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still photography worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio is now more significantly inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, rather surprisingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is boldly misused and often ridiculed, is a simple guide that creates dynamism and simultaneously preserves a measure of order within an image.
He states that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was the object of a meticulous examination.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound together the European states despite differences in language and customs.
His immense power affected everyone from the king to the peasant.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church’s financial resources are specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing dangers to neutral vessels as well.
Since there was a limited response to that tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each stage of China or each family in power represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also between each dynasty an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, a fierce war took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to reign supreme on the highest seat in the grand palace at Xi’an.
There were strong social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, to nationalism, and to the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Even after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and brilliant to succeed.
It’s the same for the military, because instead of having army rankings based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the oppressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (the light) for contemplation.
The concise balm, which survived the ages, gives a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Resting on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s not always easy to find, even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it’s complete isolation.
This can only be seen with a clear and beautiful almond-coloured sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Not much of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and members of his family.
The "high arch" mark looks like a V and the "low arch" mark looks like a comma or a caret missing its base.
Upbow means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and downbow means you should start at the frog (that’s where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A high bow generally produces a softer sound, while a low bow is stronger and more assertive.
You are free to make your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed markings are here for a musical reason, and therefore should usually be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, with their young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were sent from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789 by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a throng of people who were shouting and yelling threats against the king and the queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to have the windows of their carriage completely open.
For a moment, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obligated to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to return the money from a large portion of the expenses and the interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Surely, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of Filipinos would constitute the foundational gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period during which those events unfolded is usually known as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the very development of technology follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has “effects” on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
Given the network of national roads is not economically viable for just a handful of vehicles, and therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of vehicles also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new sleep techniques to repair bodily damage.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture linked to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place in society, were improvements over arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was perceived as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation for being a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century, primarily because the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that moment that the transfer of the title of capital from the fashion capital of Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic art reached its peak during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Previously, due to the slow pace of communication channels, styles in the west could regress by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major advances of that era was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is carried out for the production of enough food to just meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, utilizing saved seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures are gatherings of individuals with similar ideas who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
The subcultures can be distinguished based on age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as being distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which can include fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequent methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their formative years.
Children like this are called "wild" or feral. Some feral children are kept confined by people (generally their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical deficiency in a child.
It is possible that the wild children suffered from violence or severe trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or having fled.
Some others are reportedly been attacked by animals; it is said that some wandered alone in the wild.
When completely raised by non-human animals, the wild child manifests behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular animal adopting them, such as its fear or its indifference towards humans.
And yet if project-based learning should be the easiest and most interesting learning, the challenge goes a step further.
Empont is not a learning method but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals experiencing a new learning experience, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Bridges can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of bridge but so is the paperclip man from Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are integrated within the software and have the function of questioning, prompting, and explaining procedures that may have been too complex for the student to manipulate alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a significant variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, attentive, and educational, but they do.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system is intended to provide safe homes, caring healthcare staff, a stable education, and affordable health care.
Host families are expected to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of Internat lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as novel aspects of motivation when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, fleeting facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," noted how people who were unable to understand a speech due to brain damage were nevertheless capable of judging sincerity with accuracy.
You suggest that such capacities for interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection preserves the best of the expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation in both directions between all two sexes in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Starvation does not have mild consequences: growth problems, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources most easily accessible would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal foods (ants, caterpillars, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our early ancestors resolved their "protein problem" to a certain extent in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking yourself up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively discreet cue to lead you towards awareness without fully revealing yourself.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of liquids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the pressure, the more positive the force of life. All people have the potential to find peace and absolute contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were spread through the path of love of the Mahayana and through powerful techniques of Indian yoga.
At its beginning, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With yoga kundalini, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. From the end of the war, confrontations of systems, processes and culture led to a rupture between these countries.
After two years of the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought fiercely, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
Astoundingly, these plans became obsolete almost during the same night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport products is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and people across the oceans.
The work of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and its goods, and at the same time interferes with the enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most recent examples, hardly worthy of being mentioned, of this is the campaign in the North Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same moment, the German navy, which primarily used U-boats, was trying to stop that circulation.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to have easy access to the milk, hides, meat, and furs.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that grazed on hills or other grazing areas, often overseen by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These pastoral methods are still employed today.
The first railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the earliest railways consisted simply of parallel wooden posts, they allowed horses to reach greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
The sleepers were introduced early on to keep the rails in place. However, it was then realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron band on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans began to walk in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
In the past, australopithecines did not walk upright as is commonly believed.
Bipedal specializations are found on Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, and Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living more respectfully towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
It's often just a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we would need to find the root of the problems, and we should deactivate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
Following its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a rough draft written by hand signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which led him to read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 leaflets by Dunlap that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. They are birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
There are many reasons to believe that birds still revert to dinosaurs.
With feet with claws and harps, they lay eggs and walk on their two rear legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, if using computer jargon.
It is possible that internal poisoning is not immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
You should check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from a long-standing familiarity with cimicids, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs and assassin bugs are both nest builders, adapted to live in a nest or the dwelling of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the dominant neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.
Those parents can choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides the majority of scientific research.
However, it’s not only that, experimentation, and an experience is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to raise questions, and to make observations which also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external signals, are states documented in the vast majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They carried out two experiments to mark either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations within germline cells can be passed on to children, while somatic mutations can more readily cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
Within this dynamic transport network, each individual is in one way or another connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely see similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why don't they function as they should on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental unfolding?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult since driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Generally, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape their enemies more easily and find food and partners more effectively.
The vast majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the sun-loving insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many more believed the opposite—that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems right, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest in the world in terms of water discharge. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six kilometers in width.
Twenty percent of the water that rivers on the planet pour into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River, the main one, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
And even if the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were admiring of the monuments of their predecessors, which were far more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the entire world and the country with the lowest population.
The City of Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life for the majority of those who work within the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in their native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, and even though it was also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. You shouldn't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
I can also have alloys that contain small quantities of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
And so, the gremlin was a good friend to many people when he appeared.
It is sad, but with the appearance of new writing methods, shorthand has been relegated to a lower status and to lesser jobs.
People are now writing messages on computers or on computer screens, without ever having to get up from a workbench.
One can only wonder when the keyboard will be useful again when something new arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the principle that energy is required to bring a nucleus together and force protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like rolling a heavy cart over a hill. Fractionating will release the core, freeing up some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with a small nudge or even less.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and thickens to 100 km on the opposite side.
It is very low under the sea and very dense under the highlands.
It’s possible to have more impacts on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what causes people to choose or what interests them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized states as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what there is for certain people that makes them envious of the causes they pursue and what causes in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, certain behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One extreme of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or of the women).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, another transformed into an individual poorly acknowledged who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and take it over.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of their team.
This behavior frequently results in clashes between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can be found in variable time zones that may not be understood by their local administration.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team establishes the rules for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals when one puts into practice concepts of organizational learning.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a novel innovative process to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation, and at the same time a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological findings provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to research on cognition. Therefore, it limits the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the scientists’ research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes within our minds.
And even if artificial intelligence has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation within a machine.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include troubleshooting, planning and creating schedules, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
From such origins have come disciplines separated, which focus on the business of providing solutions to the real problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, extending to having been built into various computer applications and video games at home.
Field trips are an important part of all classes. But teachers would often like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can discover artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while seated with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to prepare for an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make serious efforts to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to come more prepared regarding the world around them." The need to nourish public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional school days.
The appropriate use of blogs “can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to online material, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as highlight their own perspectives on particular topics (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is the pleasant bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a wide array of art galleries and museums that exhibit Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls are located much further south, and the north is the region of Muskoka's unspoiled natural beauty and beyond.
All these reasons and even more highlight Ontario as what is considered the quintessence of Canada by outsiders.
The large plains, however, are rather sparsely populated to the north, and some are almost uninhabited wild regions.
To make a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself due to its wild animals.
The vast majority of the small islands are either independent nations or associated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these territories, and it became firmly established in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began during the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route from the Cape of Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all traveling women state that they are married, regardless of their true marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they might consider as harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You must be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend the territory (cultural differences or not, this is not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1775.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city like Daru l-Badya, and Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of knick-knacks, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city’s neighbourhoods, particularly the city centre.
And even if Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be studied to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the least expensive mountain gorilla tracking experiences in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, even if its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the key moments during Henry Louis Gates’s PBS special *Wonderful World Africa*.
The town is in stark contrast with the rest of the towns in the country, because it has a more Arabic style that is Africanizing.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the emblematic brand of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like with all the national parks of South Africa, a preservation and entrance fee must be paid daily for the park.
It may also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists consider to be their main interest.
The array of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a brilliant graph of bars, made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To have the best views of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront facing it.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island’s urban development is densely packed onto reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the place the British colonizers took as if it were their own, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, with an extension of 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not only mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remaining patches of the mighty forests that in the past covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which around a third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station between districts (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, particularly those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
The vast majority of districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches across the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The vertical drop under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the final checks by Brazilian customs are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the focus of other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
During the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the giant Province of the Indies," emerged from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the whole world.
The most important polo tournament of the year unfolds in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Small flocks and departures can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To get updates on tournaments and find out where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
British pounds will generally be accepted wherever you are on the islands, and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards will likely not be accepted, even though British and American currency can be taken; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is within the subtropical regions; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are frequent.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
It doesn't have distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or bothered.
According to park authorities, you must remain at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
It’s not important if they seem docile, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all beautiful animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, and therefore give them their space.
In May, you must be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, and therefore avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded during the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a shameful naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because of the fact that Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch to Long Bay in the north and to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and the majority are shady spots provided by the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, which have a good range of shops lined up along the coast. Swimming there is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
I like to drink French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the concept of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an 'espresso', the cappuccino arrives well topped with cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate reaches Belgian standards. Fruit tarts are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to schools are made throughout the year, and accidents due to these causes on school grounds are rare.
Therefore, you must follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear off the beaches and near the estuaries of rivers from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of these times.
Lamias do exist, however they rarely attack humans. The majority of lamias are afraid of humans and would flee by swimming.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is found in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives peace of mind to the traveler who will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements from and to the airport, or even packages that combine flights with the hotel.
You can also keep the reservation if you need time to consider the proposal or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any request for modification or change to this effect should be notified through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most of them consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll need to get up early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have finished, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special countryside activities for families with young children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, you need to check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice causes a terrifying noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make considerable efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exits can be difficult to find.
The usual offerings of special foods and drinks and of entertainment, to keep customers in good spirits, and keep them staying put.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on site. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know it’s important to remain sober.
Those who are planning to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, a lot of snow that can immobilize you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or wind-blown snow, by condensation, or by ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, conditions under ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic flows in a nearly uninterrupted manner throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and are the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari," of popular usage, refers to overland journeys to observe the magnificent African fauna, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to gather near vehicles and a standard equipment will allow us to observe them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are animals that are shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk", "safari excursion", or going for a "jog") consists of walking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you could be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus were extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that the majority of tickets for the competitions will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, with typical tickets costing around 7,000¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available to borrow, even if there aren't any present in the room.
If an ironing board isn't available or you don't really feel like wearing ironed clothes, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
You should be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, severe burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and in case of doubt, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter beasts unfamiliar to them from their regions of origin.
Animals can sense foods, cause irritation or, within homes, cause allergic reactions, spread germs or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, do not fall into the category of harmful causes.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and special duties in certain places.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike, frequently passing through remote, heavily forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep a calm head: steep slopes, narrow roads, and tight bends are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections – frequently 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, surprisingly, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other portions of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are very good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit in the bakery is common, with baked apples in pies all year round, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
German butter cookies baked in the oven also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cookies particularly harmonize well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on aromatic herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the proportion of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian gastronomy is a generic term that covers a vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, if used without further qualification, the term tends to refer to the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine boasts a range of simply seasoned dishes, with peanuts, chilies, sugar (particularly coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices being the predominant flavors favored by Javanese people.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the rider but can create safety concerns because of the potential for the rider's feet to get trapped.
If a rider is dismounted from a male horse and has a foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse flees. To minimize this risk, a good number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most knights wear riding boots with a heel and a soft sole, quite narrow.
Following this, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile's first climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and spires.
The summits offer impressive views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world constantly establish new routes between its infinite potential of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding on a snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has enthusiastic followers, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old—paintings in caves depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first ski club for leisure was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski excursions.
He's a relative but usually doesn't understand downhill skiing or alpinism, the latter practiced on steep terrain and requiring skis and boots that are much more rigid.
You should think of a ski itinerary as you would a similar hiking itinerary.
Under good conditions you can cover relatively longer distances than when walking – but you will very rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy bag on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport checks frequently.
The Schengen area, in a way, functions like a country in this case.
As long as you remain in this area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Generally, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, and therefore you will save time, money and administrative procedures.
I have no universal definition of which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition acknowledges geographical variations, where the age limit could be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be defined as traditional, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of resources for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who have other professions.
And more traditionally, not all Sami people participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, keeping reindeer primarily as animals for traction.
Many of my friends work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sami country.
And even though it has been commonly used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word "gitan" is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you visit is subject to travel recommendations, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also wish to consult the advice of governments that are not yours, yet their advice is intended for their citizens.
By way of example, American citizens in the Middle East could be faced with situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available nonetheless.
Severe weather is the generic term for all kinds of meteorological phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Inclement weather can appear anywhere in the world, and there are different types, which can depend on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of inclement weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal violent weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all the risks of severe weather that may affect their area and potentially impact all their travel plans.
Those planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the internet for 'courses for hostile environments' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A treatment should normally address all the subjects discussed here with much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last between 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aid elements, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in wilderness areas are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a non-specified gender (X) or to update documents to reflect a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor those documents simply varies everywhere.
Security checks at airports have also become much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals pre-surgery should not be expected to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the backwash of swells breaking off the beach, often at a slope or something nearby.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a rapid current towards the deep waters can form there.
The vast majority of drownings occur as a result of the exhaustion of trying to swim to shore against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you've moved out of the current, returning to swim is no more difficult than usual.
I advise you to head back to where you won’t get stuck again, and, depending on your abilities and if you’ve been noticed, you might want to wait for help.
Return shock arrives sooner than culture shock (there's less than a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had ease adapting to their new culture sometimes have particularly difficult moments readapting to their culture of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your original culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
It is possible that people do not anticipate that patience and understanding are as necessary for returning travelers as they are at home.
The spectacle of sound and light is one of the most interesting reasons for excitement for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Usually, you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors from afar. The history of sounds and lights is simply like a fairytale.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others understand Deception Island, and that the flooded caldera of an still active volcano gives a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt into the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the ridge of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4,892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, and also by expeditions that need data and voices.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give more information about connecting to this service.
A increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel to learn.
It’s something particularly popular with those who leave school, allowing them to take a gap year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling during a gap year in studies abroad can actually improve your chances of entering higher education once you return to your country of origin.
I will generally have tuition fees to enroll in those educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
Within archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
And even if the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed quite large for all kinds of yachts, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Rowing is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This coincides with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite unique elsewhere (for example, in the Netherlands the rate is one per forty).
The vast majority of different Baltic Cruises include a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for a couple of full days and still sleep on the boat at night.
You will only need a visa if you disembark from the ship for reasons other than organized excursions (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in the itineraries. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fears and personal aversions people have for other things.
Understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on feeling unable to control anything.
Delivery companies are well-paid to deliver items quickly. Frequently, time is very important for business documents, goods, or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the major companies had their own planes, but for other routes and the smaller firms there was a problem.
If they had sent the goods by air freight, on some routes, it might have taken days to get through the unloading stages and customs.
The usual way to get it through more quickly was to send it as luggage in the suitcase. Airline regulations don't allow sending luggage without a passenger, which is where we come in.
The obvious benefit of flying first class or business class is to spend a good amount of money on this privilege (or, even better, to have your company pay for it).
Indeed, it’s not a good deal: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to at least four times the normal price for business class compared to economy, and eleven times for first class!
In general, it’s not worth looking for discounts on seats in business class or first class on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airline companies know full well that there is a certain group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the privilege of arriving still quickly and comfortably, and they are billed accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language there is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldavia is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, that conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the UN member countries.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Where once stood the ancient city of Smyrna, there is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, situated around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and the old mosques and churches, even though the city has a more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish atmosphere.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble dove sculptures on some graves.
I spent a good half-hour walking around this strange village.
To the north and easily accessible, there is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous to foreigners after an enthusiastic account of its splendors documented by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you should also visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), a place of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting above all a site of mass graves and also a place that has an almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their time here, and many more still who had loved ones who were murdered or who worked there until their death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make any jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the site by writing or drawing graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
Apparently, the majority of the signs are only indicated in Catalan because the law establishes it as the first official language.
Therefore, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
And although it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get ahead in Paris is still to show your best behavior, by acting like someone who is "well-bred" (well-educated). This will make you get ahead in a considerably easier way.
The Parisians’ aloof exteriors will quickly evaporate if you make an effort at some basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
The rose garden also shelters an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
If one can find rare fauna like the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the chamois, the lynx, the wildcat, and the peacock, as well as many other more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are asked to wear skirts that cover the knees and to also have their shoulders covered.
The vast majority of monasteries provide head coverings to women who do not come prepared, but if you bring your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same decree, men were asked to wear trousers that covered their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the reserve upon entry, but this outfit is not washed after each use and therefore you may not feel comfortable wearing these trousers. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar islands in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, legumes and meat (generally pork), and uses olive oil extensively.
A simple, popular dish, especially during the summer, is bread with oil: bread with olive oil, tomato, and all sorts of available accompaniments like cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, together with the word "You" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
Good sense lends itself to easier reading, and even more so if the writing is a little complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as the majority of words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to which attention must be paid are c and g, since their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means car, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn many things about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It is needless to say that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
Frankly, people who know a little Spanish can easily conclude that Portuguese is so close it doesn’t need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Since light pollution in its heyday wasn’t the kind of problem it is today, they are usually located in towns or on campuses, easier to reach than those that were built during the modern period.
The vast majority of modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing the blossoming of cherry trees, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossom was the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants have a better appearance when they are in a natural environment, so you must resist the temptation to uproot just "one" specimen.
If you visit a formally landscaped garden and pick a few "specimens," you will also be banned, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to go and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything there once you arrive.
Since it's located within the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to manage both the heat (continuously) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, but less frequently).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
You should check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish colony of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Leire valley, of the Rhine valley, or going on a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube, or boating on the Erie Canal.
Also define routes for popular hikes and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
But one of the traditions surrounding the festivals has also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians throughout the world.
We have a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some exposed place to watch the sun rise.
I’m sure of Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Many traditional churches often celebrate an Easter vigil on the night of Saturday during Easter week, with congregations often beginning the celebration as early as midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands did so either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main animal to colonize the Galápagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, given that the sky will be dark more or less continuously.
Since the highlands are sparsely populated, and light pollution is consequently often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the shooting stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
The customs are to wear standard work clothes and colleagues address each other by their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing teamwork rather than praising individual performances.
Workers often have to obtain approval from their superiors for all the decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
